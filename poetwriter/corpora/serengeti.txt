[Verse 1]
You pinned my arm to the couch
And you're on top of me
I forgot what you looked like
It's a shame
I see you all the time now
You pinned my arm to the couch
And you hugged, and hugged, and hugged
And squeezed (x8)
And then you looked down at me confused
Then you scream
And scream (x10)
You pinned my arm to the couch
Like a banshee, inside a banshee, inside a scream
You pinned my arm to the couch
And then I scream
And scream (x10)
Then I wake the whole house up
(Then I wake the whole car up)
Then I wake the whole car up
And then I wake up the whole block
Then I wake up
Tense
[Hook]
I see you all the time now
I see you all the time
I see you all the time now
[Outro]
I told you I loved you
You said whatever
Last forever
It's a shame
I see you all the time now
I see you all the time
I see you all the time


[Verse 1: Serengeti]
All right
When you feel
Like you just can't stop
Jumping
And bumping
When you feel
Like you just can't stop
Sending telegram
After telegram
And when you feel like throwing (All right)
All your books in the air
You need to catch it
Just catch it
When you feel
Like you just can't stop (Can't stop)
Twisting and turning
And burning shit (wait a second, wait a second)
[Hook]
You need to calm it down

[Verse 2: Serengeti]
And when you feel (Like what?)
Like you just can't stop (Why's that? Why's that?)
Chasing your dreams
Impossible dreams
Impossible dreams
And when you feel
Like driving your car (Nope, nope)
Into a telephone pole
Just stop it
You got it (Hit the brakes)
And when you feel (Come on)
Like fucking shit up (Yeah)
Let's fuck shit up
Let's fuck shit up
Let's fuck shit up
 (See what happens if...)
And when you feel (How do you feel?)
Like you just can't stop (My bad)
Talking shit about each other
All the time

[Bridge]
When your fists don't fly (Yeah, calm it down)
When your grips don't got (OK, calm it down)
When your twerps don't tweak (You gotta calm it down)
When your perps don't peep (All right, calm it down)
When your hips don't dip (Yeah, calm it down)
And the kicks don't hit (Calm it down)
When your ships don't ship (OK, calm it down)
When your life don't life (Just calm it down)
When your mix don't match (How about calming down?)
When your rips don't patch (Take it easy)
When your keys don't lock (Just relax)
When your beats don't knock (OK, OK, yeah)
When your dogs don't bite (Calm it down)
When your bull don't fight (Just take it easy)
When your time stands still (Just calm it down)
Can you tell me how you feel? (Just)
[Verse 3: Sufjan Stevens and (Serengeti)]
I'm on my own two feet
But I'm not standing upright
Mine is the pressure
Mine is the pain
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down)
Was it the drugs I take?
(You need to calm it down)
Was it ambitious outbreak?
(You need to calm it down)
Mine is the fury
Mine is the gain
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down)
Shall I account for peace?
(You need to calm it down)
Shall I resist it my way?
(You got to calm it down)
Mine is the glory (You got to calm it down)
Mine is the praise (You got to calm it down)
(You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
You need to calm it down
Calm it down)
Now that I feel that shame
I've got every reason to persuade (Calm it down)
Mine is the problem (You got to calm it down)
Mine is the pain (You got to calm it down)
[Verse 3 Reprise: Son Lux]
I'm on my own two feet
But I'm not standing upright
Mine is the pressure
Mine is the pain
Was it the drugs I take?
W
as it ambitious outbreak?
Mine is the fury
Mine is the gain
Shall I account for peace?
Shall I resist it my way?
Mine is the glory
Mine is the praise
Now that I feel the shame
I've got every reason to persuade
Mine is the problem
Mine is the pain


[Verse 1]
Started life as a Christian
I was enticed by religion
To spark a spiritual life that was missing
As an acolyte
A white Jesus had me actin' right
Chasing the thoughts of an after life
So I attended service like clockwork
Sunday's best
And socks from the top drawer
But Jesus wasn't the reason for my Oxfords
I mostly went for this girl I had the hots for
[Verse 2]
Whenever I was kinda bored
Thoughts of the girl I adored ignite a war
Haunted by the angry white Jesus by the door
Natural impulses I strive to ignore
I was divided to the core
The age-old battle
Between human anatomy vs. science of the Lord
I came real close to leaving my burdens by the door
Until I asked the preacher man about the dinosaurs
[Hook: Jefferson DeJesus]
It seems if we lie
Will we lay there beside it?
They say that it's right
But it doesn't seem righteous
[Verse 3: Serengeti]
She didn't really wanna get Botox really
She rather vowed against it
But opportunity arose
It would increase her chances to get this gig
Her manager said
"I'm not saying anything
But we could really use it right now
Besides what's the big deal?
Everybody does it
We need the work
And as I face it
Everybody hires once
We gotta play the game
We're married to a different fuckin' custom
A pioneer of something new?
That's a lotta work to do
I personally I don't think that you got it in you
To champion a new cause
You look really good in draws
Sometimes you gotta follow fuckin' laws and shit"
[Bridge: Jefferson DeJesus]
They rival the stars
And they all fight with lightning
We sit by the fire
And conspire here in silence
[Hook]


This goes out to my girl Jueles
[Hook]
Favorite actor Dennehy,
 
favorite drink O'Doul's
Bears, Hawks, Sox, Bulls
So say goodbye a little longer like I ate a piece of Big Red
Grew a mustache
 
the size of Mike Ditka's forehead
Hair combed to the side looking like a piece of foam
Buick speakers, red cooler, '85 Bears 
Zubaz
Polish sausage, bratwurst, 
walking like my cock hurts
Stacy Adams, no shirt, Jewel's to get a case of Squirt
Wife's pissed cause I forgot to get the Minute Rice
So I'm back in the damn Buick to get a stinking bag of ice
To get a stinking bag of rice, my wife Jules is cute
Her tastes really move me like I ate Juicy Fruit
Had me dancing like Chris Penn in Footloose
'85 Walter rules, old style pack of Kools
Go to Ace, new tools and weed wacker fuel
'85 Bears Zubaz, Stacy Adams got ruined
Flood a basement sump pump, Shop-Vac cleanup
Cook brats, cook chops, your heat shouldn't be that hot
Keep your juices in the chops, keep your juices in the brats
Serve 'em on paper plates, 'tato salad and grape pop
My favorite actor was Dennehy long before he played Knight
When Berenger was a substitute, everything was going right
Even after Jordan left, and Dave Corzine retired
Shawon Dunston's wild throws and Mike Ditka got fired
[Hook]
Play softball with the guys, wife made curly fries
Drink about four O'Doul's, grounded out, two pop flies
In the Buick down Western, stop and get some more brats
On sale: chicken, Italian sausages, and orange pop
This week, fishing trip, gotta get some new flies
Wife packed turkey subs, Jays chips, and peach pies
Watch a little Dennehy, pull out the Laserdisc
Sniper 1, 2, and 3, Berenger makes great flicks
Listen to the Shuffle, rewind Richard Dent's part
Damn I left those orange pops in the trunk of the Skylark
Sneak a couple O'Doul's, shit there's my damn wife
You know, honey, I'll be back I gotta get some more ice
Back in the damn Buick, I should go to the damn bar
I saw Ditka once on the Edens in a sports car
[Hook]
Play a little poker, spend time with the wife
Take her out to Bennigan's, see if they cook chops right
Go out and get a Laserdisc, projection screen TV
Portillo's Italian beef and a movie starring Tommy B
Back in the damn Buick, cut on WCKG
Caught a song by Glenn Frey and an interview with Dennehy
So I'm driving down Western Ave, think I'm gonna stop at Zayre's
Got a splittin fricking headache, so I popped a couple Bayers
So I'm back in the damn Buick, think I need a oil check
The Baddest of George Throrogood smokes Stoges on my deck
Read the sport section, Bears and their old line
Trying to find a decent Fiero with a For Sale sign
Cut on WCKG, Huey Lewis and the News
The heart of rock & roll is still beatin, DONTLETDABEARSLOSE!
[Hook]
Favorite day Sunday, favorite team the Bears
Favorite store Ventures, Sears, Zayre's
Favorite show Danza, also the news
Weatherman Skilling, music the blues
Favorite actor Dennehy, favorite drink O'Doul's
Bears, Hawks, Sox, Bulls
Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls
Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls
If I was coaching the Bears, we'd at least get ten wins
Ten wins, Dennehy on the O line, Berenger at tight end (Berenger)
Favorite actor Dennehy, favorite drink O'Doul's
Bears, Hawks, Sox, Bulls
Favorite actor Farina
, dandruff tons, brats, chops, dogs, they're done

Favorite actor Farina, dandruff tons
Brats, chops, dogs, they're done
Favorite coach Ditka, vacation place 'consin
Sausage, Johnson's, Chicken, Swanson's

[Verse 1: Serengeti]
That not being big shit and not lovin' obscurity
Keep it real in rap, don't mess with maturity
People get older, mountain boulders
When ridin' the ropes starts to mess with your back and shoulder
Keep on with the keep on, keep on
Keep on
Shitty shit to sleep on
Thorny vines and 
glasses
To buy us time
Lines lost luster
Feeling like a buster
Few days pass by, start to regain the luster
It just keeps up and down
Like everything
Face facts
Don't get too excited, and don't get a heart attack
[Hook: Sicker Man]
Day By day
No matter where you are
I will be a heartbeat
Away from you
[Serengeti]
And not being big shit, and not lovin' obscurity
Keep it real in rap don't mess with maturity
People get older, mountain boulders
When ridin' the ropes and starts to mess with your back and shoulder
Keep on with the keep on, keep on, keep on
Shitty shit to sleep on
Thorny vines and glasses
To buy us time
Lines lost luster
Feeling like a buster
Few days pass by start to regain the luster
It just keeps up and down
Like everything, face facts
Don't get a heart attack jack
Appreciate when the luster's back
Notice when it's gone and deal
Different sides like the colors of the wheel
[mumbling] (Boom, boom...)
[Outro: Sicker Man]
...Always
It's cool, it's fine
It's great, it's good, it's great
It's great, it's great, it's fine, it's fine
It's perfect, it's great
[?]
It's sad, a drag
Tonight, today
Good
Happy
It's cool it's perfect
It's fine
It's fine
It's cool
It's great
It's great
It is...
It is...


[Verse 1]
Never go to work, everything messy
Ashes everywhere, giant cans of Pepsi
Constant updates, the van needs brakes
Everything is great, stolen license plates
Dandruff everywhere, kids got colds
Dishes in the sink, place smells like molds
Live inside cable, fantasize about moves
Enter your 30’s, still wearing Jerseys
Need to do burpees, take more showers
Get yourself together, assume a spirit power
Maybe it's a raven, maybe need prestique
Same conversation, the same long weeks
[Verse 2]
I want a simple life, where we milk cows and cobras
Coral snakes, soufflés of the lightest cakes
Moon lightning, stationed exercise biking
The same qualities found in the common Viking
Floyd similar to the singer, Lloyd
The fang of the cobra and the morning avoid
They’re just kin called Roys and The Donovan Boys
All six of them, exotic like British men
I’m like, fellas, you could have won a Tony
We could have been brothers like Josiah and Yoni
There’s so much room, beautiful purple flowers bloom
Check me out, man, I’ll be over soon
The detective skills of Dolph Lundgren, L.A.’s never been more safe
The great escape is tougher, like having a family complicates
Look on the bright side
There’s many things to be happy for
Like living in Los Angeles with an unlocked door
That's what you pay Dolph for
Beaver coats, pretty walls, snore atop a house for birds
A total loss for use of words, to shave your lamb, that shit was cold
The weight of snow on naked trees, the weight of giving up a dream
Settle down into the soil, sprout another dream tutorial
Grubby criminals versus the fire department, I followed them to the apartment, sergeant
Axes out, with positioned on sixth floor, hoses up the staircase, aimed at their front door
We got ‘em, those bastards won’t know what hit ‘em
Chalk one up for the good guys, we got ‘em, captain
[Verse 3]
Hey, marry into royalty, become a duke
Make your buddies puke, ‘cause you joined the new social loop
Involving velvet, couplets, and little bells
Go to hell, suckers, enjoy livin' at your brothers'
And your covers smell like rubber
Sleeping bags, and cupboard's mold
Walkin' to your car cold
I’m children's choirs and gray tea old


[Verse 1]
Good morning to the world, art is just so chaotic
Stop being gloomy and recycle paper products
And why not, pardon me the cool girl
It ain’t only misery and depression in the world
This orange soup you had, my living is in vain
Finishing dressers growing your own grains
Become a dentist, scribe poetry with quills
Exact your vengeance, become more skilled
In vinking, drinking and taking films
Enjoy a nice novel on the top of a rotto
Watch the sunset and return to the hostel
Drop off your novel, return to the brothel and chill
[Verse 2]
Hey, lighten up here, turn your troubles into poems
Make him sell ‘em, when you get mad, thrown 'em
Get stoned, burn everything you own
Carve little gnomes, out of a little stones
How’s that? Off the drip to search the athos
You can move to atasville and rule a city college
Become a chef, take tiny little baby steps
Study music, fall in love with the treble clef
It don’t matter, be careful when you’re milking at her
Improve your magic set, slick pair of daggers
It feel right? Heavy or light
Move to Oakland, blend into the night
And chill, motherfucker
Take a load off for me
[Verse 3]
Chill, relax, throw away your stuff
Get a job [?], it won’t be enough to
Do heroin, it's medicine, with a chick that's part Bedouin
Lovely lady friend that you met in the Netherlands
And all your travels, turn vegan, eat apples
Sneak bites of turkey ever since you turn thirty
Changing a [?], Bombay [?]
Disappoint your parents from your disappointing parents
Sue your Bedouin friend, have feeling of remorse
Have sex with a horse, make it consider a divorce
And chill
Chill
[Outro]
I’m so happy you can slap me, you can fuck me and I’m the happy-
[?] so much that you can do
All the time
You be happy
I’m so happy you can slap me
You can slap me
I'll hang your paintings, we'll go dancing, we'll have a fun time-


[Hook]
I saw a man breaking his vows for the first time
He looked like he was having fun, fun
Finally got to use that one line
It looked like he was having fun, fun
[Verse 1]
The Charleston, and pearls, woman silent on his arm, yep
It was a disco, disco, disco
Take it to the bridge then
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
And the Charleston, woman silent on his arm
Beautiful pearls, beautiful pearls
Cross the Rhine
Got to the east
Bonn was a great time, yeah
Dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance
[???]
[Outro]
I saw a man breaking his vows for the first time
He looked like he was having fun, fun
Finally got to use that one line
Finally got to cross the Rhine, Rhine

It's the Deacon Kenny speakin'
Step to Tha Teachaz
Your nose will be leakin' all on the streets and
Your girl will be screamin'
I told you the KDz
Won't stop a vegan
Buying, drinking also thinkin'
Straight from the ground cause I was not playin'
I got styles and I am amazing, oh
I am tenacious, my delta is spacious
Kill like the Deacon

Gracious, helpful, also courageous

KDz Killa Deacon
I wanna give a  shoutout to my brother Tanya
Or uh, Latanya - that's ladyboy
And my momma
The DeeDee Deacon
And the whole thing about her
In that first verse - the end of it
I wasn't trying to say that Tanya and my mama, you bang 'em, uh
It's a metaphor for life:
You gotta get out and do something!
You gotta get out and do something!
You gotta get up and do something!
You bang 'em!
You like it you bang it!
Sometimes you don't wanna go to work but you still gotta bang it!
You gotta bang it!

You bang it you do it you like it you do it!
Sometimes you gotta do shit you don't wanna do!
Metaphor!
[?]
Shouts to my mama
Y'all must be crazy
Step to the Deacon
Step to the Deacon
Whole face leaking we'll see your girl screaming
You don't want that 'n'
I don't want that
I'm a peaceful man
And though I ain't no beacon
Alright I ain't no vegan
Props to the vegan respects to 'em but I ain't no vegan


[Verse 1]
I used to be down and not have a friend
Groundhog Day like this shit don't end
And trying keep up with the latest trends
You say you don't give a damn, but you pretend
Last Saturday I was in Berlin
You can hear my ass rap on 2K10
East L.A be looking all grim
Homegirl had hop she could touch the rim
Strong-ass legs cause she always swim
Took her out to dinner dropped her off at the gym
Waikiki like BJ Penn
You say you really like her but she's with your friend
And, what's . . . chagrin?
Play a sad song like a violin
It's Saturday again
Don't feel bad lift up your chin
[Verse 2]
I felt powerless so I said, "Why me?"
Life got rough like a desert, G
Reinvent yourself like a celebrity
Go to a lot of places, get in for free
We, experienced such glee
Rough fast feet need vitamin G
I skateboarded and hurt my knee
I sat right next to a willow tree
I did DMT
In high school I rapped like a G
My father said, "Son, don't be me."
When I was 21 we shared some tea
We, get along beautifully
I"m from Chicago like Mr. T
Advance Base made the beat A.R.P
I have a few friends in NYC
Oh
Oh
[Verse 3]
I did some strange things but kept it on the low
I'm a rap artist so I'm in the know
Last weekend I tried some blow
Kept fucking with my ears sort of like Van Gogh
Around Here like the Counting Crows
They said, "Turn it down," but I said, "Hell no."
Then she said she had to go
She had to go to work cause she needs that dough
Then I turned on Camp Lo
Then Nobel just 
Then I stubbed my toe
I wanted to curse but I just yelled, "YO!"
Oh


[Hook]
And her strength overwhelmed his karate
And her strength it overwhelmed the boy
[Verse 1]
Coin collections, camcorders and silverware
Estrangulacións, police called on the au pair
She’s been stressed since Jess left, that automatic withdrawal
A couple belts, several stripes
Poor little Charles
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Now she doesn’t really drink
She just sits around and talks
And thought it’s totally Ginger’s fault, that her child couldn’t walk
Had to get another gig
Quick temper with little Chuck
Dreams of just returns were once cuddled by the bottle worm
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Everyday on the bus, roll with wretched old Ginger
Excuse after excuse about Hollywood and motorcross dreams
Made her think of her own son, and ideas that she once had
Takes it out on the boy
And the hope of his little class
[Outro]
And her strength overwhelmed his karate
And her strength overwhelmed the boy
And her strength overwhelmed his karate
And her strength overwhelmed the boy
And her strength overwhelms his karate
And her strength overwhelms the boy


Kiss...
Yeah, Yo
Sorry, I really meant to wake you
But since you're up do you mind if I taste you?
I'm in love a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'
Maybe she's gardening now
Maybe at the ice arena practicing her sow cow, you know -
A double or a triple
Maybe going over contracts with a school principal
[?] in neat trim, when students look up you don't want them to think grim
What a great sales pitch. You keep this up, you're destined to be rich, bitch
[Honey]
You make everything right -
The hottest humid day to the most beautiful fall night. [Honey]
I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'
Buying olives and grapes
Is she having friends over, marinating stakes? [Oh, honey]
I hope she doesn't have a date
She lives in California, we're separated by nine states
My name ain't even in her phone under D -
Random number 3123, "Hey who's this?"
Listening to kiss
"I just want to tell you I always think about you bitch." [Well, honey]
I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'
Maybe she's going to a club
Maybe she's playing soccer, maybe buying drugs
Maybe she's cleaning her tub
Unclogging drains, yuck, yellow rubber gloves. [Honey]
V-neck T-shirt, sort of sweaty, listening to men at work
She might have a night off
As far as rappers go, day flow soft but
I'm in love with a woman [well honey]
I always think about what the hell is this woman doin' man?
Especially at night - I think about some dude saying "yeah" and her saying "yeah right there" -
Scratchin' his back, feet up in the air, man that shit's whack. [Honey]
I guess she's only human, 'specially since she don't know what the hell I'm doin'
Or much less care
I'm at the crib drinkin' Big Bear
In my mind like Fred Astaire dancin' all around like the prom queen and king crown
My life's upside down like a [?] border
Life and times of Bobby Brown man. [Honey]
Still I think about her often
As I get older and close to the coffin
I dearly need love
I wanna feel impervious to pain like a metal glove
Like a released flock of white doves
This shit gets worse when I'm buzzed
I hope she don't go to the club
I always think about [Honey] yeah [Honey]
I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'
[Gimme a kiss, kiss honey]
[Gimme a kiss, kiss. Kiss kiss]
[I'mma put you out here and ride you back.]
I'm in love with a woman
I dunno if it's love but I always think about what she's doin'
[Gimme a kiss]
Listenin' to kiss. [Honey]
[Do you mind if I kiss you?]
[Be my woman]
[Do you mind if I hug you?]
[Be my woman. Be my woman and stand by me.]
[Do you mind if I kiss you?]
[Be my woman]
[Do you mind if I hug you?]
[That's the way it's got got got to be]


[Verse 1]
I got a seat by myself on the Greyhound
There was a fight in the ticket line
I was 
by in time
 outside of Memphis
Weekly raid off the express way
I burned every bridge I’ve ever build
It’s time to see what I’m made of
It’s time to see what I’m made of
[Verse 2]
I walk into a bar
Ten past midnight
Hey, how are you doing, darling?
I hope you’re feeling alright tonight
Pardon me, my man, you see, I don’t think the lady minds
We can do this two ways
We can step outside, bottom line
I burned every bridge I own
It’s time to see what I’m made of
No more horsing around, ‘cause
It’s time to see what I’m made of


[Intro]
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time
We know Spanish and karate
It’s different now, I’ll show you how
Friends for dinner, we feed the geese
Manhattan beach, Miami, honey
I’ll start painting, painters swimming
Miami leaning, New York dinner
We’ll set the table, we’ll eat together
We’ll make leather summer sweaters
We’ll go peppers, we’ll go hunting
This is something Diana Fresco
We’ll eat Cuban, pick up Spanish
We’ll go dancing, we’ll eat pumpkins
[Hook]
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time
I really think it’s time
Believe me this time, we’ll go mainstream
We’ll eat tapas, I’ll be an actor
You an actress, I'll carve knick-knacks
Make you cinnamon, get a puppy
Name him Benjamin, dance all night then
Kiss you, darling, I’ll be clean like
Plates for starving, can't you trust me?
Oh no, fuck me, ah shit, fuck you
I call fresh too, I don’t need this
I’ll go dancing by myself, then
I don’t need this, I don’t need this
I’ll go dancing by myself, then
This is for you, I don’t like pets
Or Miami,
 I stay solo, I’m fine alone
My home I’ve had without you mad
All the time, this is fine
I’ll eat indoors, I’ll speak English
I don’t need this, this is for you
I’m fine alone, this is for you, I don’t need this, man
[Hook] (x2)
I really think it’s time
[Outro]
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
We’ll go dancing
We’ll go dancing, believe me this time
I really think it’s time


[Verse 1]
The sun's rising above the mountains
People on the bus and we're bouncing
From Oakland to LA, the nightway
Searching for an enlightened mind state
Spend our whole lives trying to get them straight
Dollar dollar bills
It's more than paying bills
Do as thou will
That's the luckiest kind
Wine busted open in my bag
Spilled everywhere, people are so mad
Morning time in LA is such a wonderful sad
So many of us
As we gathered our bags
Close
Heading to LA on hope
Close
Heading to LA on hope
[Verse 2]
She was crying in the abortion clinic
Her pimp's name was British
He was a mean son of a bitch
Who always hated tennis
The rackets, the courts, the scoring
The time honored tradition
I sat next to her and told her I would listen
"What are you, a superman?
An ex-marine hero?"
Stepped outside
Pimp
And a man that's new here
Just trying to be a gentlemen
Do better than last year
We will
Livin' in LA on hope
We're close
[Outro]
Ah ah
Erotic city
Erotic city
Erotic city
Spend our whole lives
Trying to get them straight
Erotic city
Ah ah ah
Erotic City


[Verse 1: Serengeti]
Bookstores are taking cats, how beautiful is this?
As beautiful as the swiss or oceanic abyss
As beautiful as a kiss near a prostitute's hips
You fall in love with and move to the shore by the ships
A new life, A beautiful new wife, assorted pasts of sorts
As beautiful as a porsche, as beautiful as learning Norse
As beautiful as a bookstore that'll take in a horse
A wonderful new pad, a beautiful new job, beautiful bay windows
The perfect route to jog
A bigger kitchen
Then a party so less tension
Endless possibilities, disputes handled civily
Getting to know the wife, the excitement of living in Dwight
Neighbours are great, the aromas cuz' the neighbours bake
Until a 'oh-oh!', something smells fishy
The upcoming years, cause quite the tizzy
The drive down is quicker, the way back is longer
Is this killing us, cuz' it's making us sombre?
Blinds always closed, this byzantine ode
Beautiful kitchen once, suitcases on the stove, we used to take baths in lakes on the ocean floor
[Verse 2: Serengeti]
Beautiful French artistry, a detailed door
What happened to bookstores that would take in a boar
Beautiful bay windows drawn closed Eleanor
You're sleeping outside, all our friends died
Our beautiful new apartment, turned into a dive
We used to speak Norse and pluck hairs from each other's chests
Now I walk over you in the morning on the back steps
No goodnight: no more trots to and from the docks
No more window shopping for books or boutique clocks
But I do remember, the oceanic abyss
As beautiful as a kiss as beautiful as the swiss
No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight
No goodnight
This Byzantine ode was hard to write


[Intro]
Louise, R.N
Today I was walking
Estimated release date: one week from today
[Verse 1]
The antibiotics made me hallucinate
Cops arresting patients, Arabian spiders inside my arms
And Uncle Traum
And then my wife got shot
She was seeing him for a year
I had no idea, 'til brother's post
[Verse 2]
I'm in the hospital
I told pretty Louise, the R.N., and she checked in about 4 am
I haven’t slept the whole night
I called the wife’s folks to find out when the funeral was
No one ever answered the phone
[Verse 3]
In brother's post she was shot in a drug deal
Traum was a meth addict
I saw him smoking crack through a block window
In the basement. He was in his bed, he played speed metal too
She was in his press photos, damn it
I had no idea
[Verse 4]
I'm in the hospital
She was dancing for him, with the lovers
She could really dance, really dance
Really move, really move
I'm wide awake waiting for the morning news
It’s sure to be the lead story, man
"Drug deaths in Des Plaines, shooter's not apprehended, no suspects"
It's 7 AM, news ain't coming on
It's Sunday. I had no idea
Some movie. Called and called and calling
I'm scared. They took out my breathing tube


I'm dark, like bitten by a shark
Over her-on spot, it takes over a park
That's scary, look at the monster you married
You never really know someone till you're both buried
Deep in debt, fights for respect
Now when you both paid, about to build a second debt
Goddammit
You make people nervous
Turn into a serpent, turn into a circus
My turn please, Geti Coon King-Master of the Neegs
Master of everything Busch League
One flight up steps you feel all fatigued
Or get a new job and realize you can't read
Stabbed in the back, anxiety attack
This ain't the way that your buddy supposed to act
Me and the wife were going to get matching tats
Oh my dear, how lovable is that?
Light as a feather, stiff as a dead cat-Like
And all the games that kids play
Beat you to death cause humans do not say-Nothing
Look at the monster you're spooning
You never really know someone till you're both ruined
Covered in mud, eating patties of blood
Shit happened quick like a fucking flash flood
-Chorus-
Off the tracks and on the mat, and oh, it's getting old
Sleeping with my wallet and my keys in my pocket
On a pool table somewhere out in Stockton
Cell phone dead, bank account empty
When so-and-so was your age she was pushing a Bentley
Change rolled out, fell in the side pocket
Crumpled up photos, a dead girls locket
Thigh bruises, that's a trait that your woman uses
Maybe she's shooting up, or just bumping into stuff
Who knows? That's the way that the river flows
Search her clothes, the odometer on the car knows
I'm harsh, like drowning in a marsh
Or taking a Xanax then drinking some 
Sparks
Fall apart, crumble like colossus
The roads've been messy and I haven't had galoshes
Driving down a dark path then you hit an ostrich
Feathers and blood, tires stuck in the mud
Modest man, accept that you're a peasant
Maintaining a slub life really ain't pleasant
Diner town, job as a hospital clown
Give the kids a laugh crying the bath
Indie flick-like, but nobody's taping
There ain't no credits, there ain't no escaping
Fuck it, like Asian towns in the jungle
Last Man standing like the first royal rumble
-Chorus-
Off the tracks and on the mat, and oh, it's getting old. x2


[Verse 1: Serengeti]
In UFC 3
 
he choked a man with his Gi
Lost his grip though and got hit with the knee
Highlight reel the way he pleaded with the referee
Swore he wasn't knocked out, even with his lights out
In UFC 4,
 arm barred by 
Igor
Said he never,
 the pain was too much to endure
Disappointed, never get into the octagon
Lived a quiet life in the southwest with his step-mom
[Verse 2: Serengeti]
Around UFC 38 he tried to get back in shape
Give it another shot; under-hooks and learn to dirty box
But while training he popped his MCL
Said he's too old to put his body through this much hell
But in UFC 3 he choked a man with his gi
If he just would have held on or avoided the knee
What-ifs, not everyone can win championships
With that known is it better to not even attempt?
[Sample] (yes?)
[Verse 3: Serengeti]
Around UFC 10 
he fell in love with the wren
Built little cages so they can go out and in
Around then he stopped going to the gym
Said he had other priorities he'd like to get in
Instead of training, something a little more simple
For years he watched the flying 
bees
 stop by his window
So pretty, the way they danced by the [?] bushes
A far cry from double X when he pull you pushes
Around UFC 36 was the death of the 
remitch[?]
He felt so sad he buried him by his dad
Confused the things he loved in life were gone
Still in the south-west just him and his step-mom
Around UFC 38 he tried to get back in shape
Was tired of Arizona and wanted to get his own place
The years off finally caught up with him
If he just would have stayed focused he might of notched a win
Maybe he could have opened his own gym
[Yelled] (Shit! Shit!)
[Verse 4: Serengeti]
Around UFC 79 he fell in love with red wine
At the local bar idols, he'd watch fights all the time
Wall of fame; a framed photo from when he used to train
Decided to stay with his step-mom and help her through minor back-pain
Finited idols
The place is packed with hot shots
And wannabes and tough guys who wanna see what the vets got
Hey washout, you still think you weren't knocked out?
You applied
, you don't know anything what the octagon's about
Oh yeah, old man, lets step outside
It was after a few Merlots so the challenge he obliged
He Walked out first and was attacked from the back
Rear naked choke so deep it knocked off his hat
Flashback to the UFC 3
Where if he just would have held on to the technique with the gi
Nightmares about where his life be
Reversed it this time and knocked the punk out with his knee
[Outro: Serengeti]
And winner by K.O.
 Hailing from Battle Creek, Michigan
Residing in Scottsdale Arizona
Gary 'The Whip' Wooooooooorsh!
GARY 'THE WHIP' WOOOOOOOOOOOORSH!
Give it up... FOR THE WHIP!
*Whipping/punching sounds**


I don't know nothing about no cubists but the D leaves the Buddhist blessed
Sometime my gal Jueles leaves my ass stupid stressed
"Pick up this or that, cut off the TV too"
She wasn't saying nothing when I brought back 22
K's of the bread I won the Eliminator
I turned down the opportunity to be the Gladiator
That's called love and devotion and sacrifice
When I crushed Nitro into the wall in Powerball
 she didn't say nothing nice
Go into the garage start smoking cheeba like
Hold in the reefer blow it out by the speaker lights
So I can chill, calm down, take a shower, and shave then
Sometimes I wouldn't do nothing for Jueles these days
I sit back on the couch
Me and Jueles share ice
[?], [?], [?], and [?]
Ain't nothing 'bout nothing like sports or the game of heart to heart
She's deeper, I'm here like firing up GoKarts
But still, fit like batting glove or new broken-in catchers mitt
Or a new [?]
Vince on the kitchen floor
We a perfect team
Scrabble team played team sport focus
She seven title "S-A-U-S-A-G-E"
I'm in front of the Polish Cart
I'm buying it's beautiful
Beautiful move, beautiful team, team play
Think about that
I'd do anything for Jueles
I'm sorry about the coat on the banister TV too loud
She said watching me crush Nitro in Powerball and Joust too
She said she was so proud she couldn't say anything out-loud to talk
Cut on the kettle whistle up hot toddy for two
We went for a walk, cracked open an O.D
Leave us, alone
We in a private home owners zone
Buddhist and Cubist fit together like a Rubik's Cube
She thinks deeply, I know when I want food
She said she saw me on Power 50 playing Powerball
Nitro tried to step up crushed his shoulder straight into the wall
Or when I knocked him out in Joust
Or when his mouth piece flew out
She screamed so loud
It formed an image in clouds she took a picture
And when I came home, she was so proud she couldn't say nothing out-loud to the talk back in the day
Made her super proud that's called compromise
Kettle whistle, hot toddy
I got a case of the two of the O-D-O ULE
Winning games all night
Sometimes Polish Scrabble focus
She seven title "S-A-U-S-A-G-E"
I'm in front of the Polish
Now we in the evening
Settle down orneries
Invite from a new bud Donnie and his wife Connie to play more Scrabble
Doul's and hot toddies
Come play team things
Drink Doul's Drink hot toddies
She hot toddies I drink Doul's
Sometimes kettle whistles or hot toddy whiskey
Might grab all the dough
Throw the Frisbee outside
That's Buddhist and Cubists getting together for do this
I'm talking about ruthless doing it
I'm talking about teacher movement
She said I Scrabble full space, playing together
She seven title "S-A-U-S-A-G-E"
I'm in front of that Polish
That's called love and devotion and sacrifice
When I crushed Nitro into the wall in Powerball it wasn't nice
Jueles said when she saw me out-loud with clouds formed into something into the sky we saw the picture
She couldn't even say it out-loud when I came home because she was too proud to say the thing at home
That's called sacrifice and Jueles


It's hot and hazy
I feel like Alonzo Spellman when he went crazy
Hitchhiking in a hospital gown
Until Samurai Mike came and cooled him down
Man, Maureen made a real nice spread
Cole slaw, kabobs, noodles and deviled eggs
I feel like The Fridge when he met Reagan
Filet mignon, baked potato, sour cream and bacon
I haven't felt this way since Superbowl Twenty
Or that time I met the Beringers outside of Ricobene's
Ozzie Guillen
Ozzie Guillen
I swear O'Douls never made me feel like this
Dancing to Phil Collins, loose by the hips
I feel like Willie Gault, normally I'm Steve Fuller
It's not my fault that I knocked over the cooler
The meat's from Moo and Oinks in the dirt, wash it off
Raise up your flame and put on some extra 'que sauce
I keep whizzing, I keep eating all the chicken
I jumped in the pool with Maureen's dog Mittens
I'm sopping wet
My Zubaz are off
My Brooks are so heavy
Ozzie Guillen
Ozzie Guillen
Ozzie Guillen
Man, O'Douls is making me tired
My Craig Hodges jersey is dirty
My shorts are in the dryer
I feel like Mongo in '86 in his suite
Hanging out with McMahon after the Bears got beat
Or Lee Smith when they lost to the Padres
Or when "Hawk" Dawson got hit in the face and got dazed
I still don't forgive Eric Show to this day
Or Scottie Pippen when told Phil he wouldn't play, like
Ozzie Guillen
Oh, you gonna let Toni Kucoc take the last shot?
Ozzie Guillen
I lost to a kid in checkers
And if I drive home this way call 
Victory Auto Wreckers
Now it's night and I'm sleeping on Maureen's hood
Sleeping on a Thunderbird with no shorts don't feel good
Jueles has my keys and folded up my dry shorts
She opens up the Fiero and I hop in head first
Juelie, my Brooks are soaking wet
My O'Douls just didn't taste right
Jueles said "Hey Kenny," I said "Yeah"
She said 
"Kenny baby, you know you were drinking Bud Light?
"
I said "What?"
Ozzie Guillen
Ozzie Guillen
Ozzie Guillen
(Good job with the noodles, Maureen.)
Ozzie Guillen


[Serengeti]
Like fat women do Pilates
And always talking that they've noticed
These fabulous changes to their bodies
HAHAHA- 
jokes!
The only way you lose weight:
If you start to smoke coke
Cause I be at them mix parties
Where wifes have face jobs
And husbands drive Maseratis
And kids say to their mommies:
"Ugh! I'm so bored
I don't wanna go skiing"
The fabulous North Shore:
When trains come through
Conductor says "ALL ABOARD!"
And the kids go to Yale
And daddy takes the whole family
To 
the lake
So they can sail
Come home and have dinner
"OK, Sport! Kiddo!
'Ey you're a winner!"
You don't drop bombs
The only one that does that
Is 
Dirty Heat
 and Barry Bonds
I don't know why they love diamonds
The only thing I love is getting cooch
Having fun and rhymin'
But of course I love sports
Went to Sam's house
He didn't have no damn wine corks
It was me, Rod, and Jessie
Said we couldn't stay there no more
We left her pad too messy
It wasn't my fault
I cleaned up my bedroom
In sauteed spaghetti sauce
And it was all on Rod
Constantly smoking weed and
Speeches how he found God
And we was back by the lake;
Jess told me undress
We swam and we formed wakes
Hey Rod, they have (???)
"That's God,"
 I said to him
"Simple and pure"
Wolverine rejuvenation
I read a book about words
And supreme concentration
My rhymes are gettin simple:
Judy Blume wrote Freckle Juice
The kids is in the proof— pimples
(fuck! I fucked up!)
Them rappers need bodyguards
Plus they in competition
To always see who's the most hard
(How many cans of whimsy did you drink, Dave?)
Seven!
I want to make an album so I called up Kevin
Script was fake so I ran it through Jake
And then we made an album
Called "Must we Always Contemplate?"
(What's the answer to that, Dave?)
Not yes
Lifted up her skirt, all I saw was unrest
(How many cans of whimsy did you drink, Dave?
How many cans of whimsy did you drink?)
Seven! All I saw was unrest
Seven! Called up Kevin
(What's the answer to that, Dave?)
Not yes
(What's the answer to that, Dave?)
Not yes
Unrest
Them rappers need bodyguards
Plus they in competition
To always see who's the most hard

Noodles noodles noodles noodles) X2

How many cans of whimsy did you drink?) X2
[Serengeti]
I wear big watches
I looked in my bedroom
All I saw were Sasquatches


[Verse 1]
You can spend[?] the whole quinoa
Ghost dance in Oregon
Open up your origins so you can find the Lord again
Just please don't hoard again
Dreams of a treasure trove
It's really just kite strings
Miss pink potato nose
White denim raver clothes
Turtlenecks and flannel coats
Parts of old drift boats
Auto repair brake quotes
Mad films by Glenn Close too
[Hook]
The cycles of the seasons change
I'm turning into shards of clay
I haven't had the perfect time yet
I'm betting on myself again
I'm betting on myself again
[Verse 2]
Mad films with Glenn Close
Go north to the frontier
Fossil hunt in Alaska
All we found was deer
Thanks to the Jubilee all debts have been cleared
Let's go celebrate, buy something expensively weird
It's like bells on bobsleds keeping me up late
A four year affair with a woman named Irate
Ringing in my ear like "How the hell can I germinate? We should just terminate"
What's the wait, what's the mate?
Rather be glutenous, than have a long long great time
[???]
[Hook](x3)
[Outro]
And cycles of the seasons change
She will not fly on aeroplanes


[Hook]
Shazaam shazaam
Shaq don't want none
Shazaam shazaam
Shaq don't want none
Shazaam shazaam
Shaq don't want none
Jolly green giants get cut
Don't ever step to the Killer Deacon
Talkin 'bout the 'stache look silly
Why are you speaking
You're not thinking
Don't you know that I'm a teacher
Bypass your viper
Steal your car speakers
I'll hustle ya
I'll bludge ya
I'll muscle ya
I'll scuffle ya
You're sleeping
You must not be up
Snoring, counting sheep
Snooze and start beef
You got the D's on the mission
No relief chief
Save the nine
I'm the king of the pride
You too soft, the Teachaz
We hoop outside
As far as acting go
I'm Marlon Brando
Don't make the D's say what's up in Orlando
[Hook]
All you got is a penny
I got the pm
Your nickname is fu?
Mine's is the Deacon
You know what that means
Let's just compare teams
The evidence
You'll get creamed
Teachaz vs. the Magic
That's not a real thing
Abra kadabra
The hooper
The rapper
The actor
You after?
David make the lions bow down to the master
You got no handles
You double dribble
You too sweet like a lollipopsicle
We a militia
You fun and tickles
You a slingshot
KDz is a missile
[Hook]


[Verse 1]
Yeah, you can have it all
You can get the girl
And if you're short
Be the tallest midget in the world
It's your orchard, no self-torture
Hold head high like the guy on the new yorker
Though, That guy reminds me of slavery
I'll let that inspire me to bravery
Click twitter read j smooth and be the boy
YouTube for reruns of Freakazoid
Trying not to laugh or even talk a lot
People try to get shit done at the coffee shop
Good script, man
Grab that oscar
Don't settle for shrimp pans, have that lobster
But sit straight or you'll have bad posture
And run into a hunchback
And damn that's awkward
More rap advice
I'll open the coffers
You don't have to ask, I'll just offer
[Hook]
Believe me I understand
I lost a couple battles like MC Shan
Now my days go according to plan
Powerful man, universe man
This is not email spam
Or trojan malware that eats up ram
Just follow step one, step two then bam
Powerful man, universe man
And it don't cost three grand
You don't have to swear an oath to goat god pan
Don't need muscles or a situation tan
Powerful man, universe man
[Verse 2]
Go easy on the buffalo wings
Do your best to stay out of a juggalo ring
Bring half the intensity 
Mark Ruffalo
 brings
And you'll do fine
A little Windex makes your school shoes shine
Or rock 'em all scuffed, the weird kids are artsy
The jocks are all tough
Had an x-ray and everything the doctor saw sucked
I still feel awesome
Unless I feel weird
I keep it confident for the sex appeal, yeah
And walk like a kind, a queen, if you're a lady
It all comes in time
Like the teeth of a baby
Just a little bit of crying and bleeding in between
After ill meals there's still appliances to clean
No, trash is in the blue, recycling in the green
Now go out there and be somebody
[Hook]


[Intro]
I'll wear a false nose for your wedding
I'll bring you bedding as gifts
When you were mine, when you were mine, and I was mine
When I was mine, when I was mine, when you were mine
[Verse 1]
I see you standing, standing there with your husband
I brought you something so you'd sleep with me
I'll hide behind, I'll hide behind, wasn't time
It wasn't time, I hide behind, I hide behind
[Outro]
I'll wear a false nose to your wedding (x3)
I'll bring you something, so you'd sleep with me
I see you standing, standing there with your husband
I'll wear a false nose to your wedding


[Intro]
Hey Tobias, this is Dave. Here's your song, boss. It's called "Accommodating"
[Hook]
All you do is accommodate: "What do you like to do?"
I wish that I could find joys in accommodating too
Would you like to be a captain, maybe even be a monster?
Turn me into an imposter, make me more accommodating too
Make me more accommodating too
[Verse 1]
Laying always on the couches, never cleaning up the dishes
Can't appease your simple wishes, take your medicine from your dentist
You never seem to be pissed off much, everything seems wide enough so
Broke your favorite coffee cup, said to me "It's only stuff."
Said to me "It's only stuff."
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Or maybe I could cook you dinner, stuff you sausage
Make you candles, clean your office
Paint your bedroom disco blue
Accommodating just like you
Teach you how to fly a airplane
Build a hot rod catch a runway
Rearrange your room alone
Teach you how to make cologne
Instruct you how to play a bagpipe
Lose some weight and learn to eat right
Wiretap a telephone, extract your own pheromones
Extract your own pheromones
[Outro]
All you do is accommodate: "What do you like to do?"
I wish that I could find choice in accommodating too
Would you like to be a captain, maybe even be a monster
Turn you into an impostor, make you more complicated too
Make you more complicated too


[Verse 1]
If I can get amnesia
See you with fresh brown eyes
We can finally split up
And stop bossing around
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
I wouldn’t have to fake my death
[Verse 2]
Start to getting somewhere, maybe
Change my name to Peter Penagos
Find love in Quito
Getting the fuck out of Lagos
Buy my own street cart
Specialize in beef hearts
Be a man of the people
Be a man of the people
[Outro]
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
If I can get amnesia
And see you again


[Verse 1:]
Ever since I got divorced
Everything's been going right on course
I've been riding a horse
Doing a little horse is fun in shorts
Relaxting, texting, sleeping
Refilling glasses of Riesling
What a great way to spend an evening
I look so good I'm beaming
Ever since I lost my job
I started a blog
It's been going so great
It's about the ins and outs of the perfect date
Film tickets and ratings
To kiss in the first minute or waiting
Just get it over with
(That blog post got viewed the most)
Ever since I got a nose job
I've had a more appealing snoz
It's not so big and bulky
It's small and cute like Coqui
Those little 22-ounce bottles
I feel right at home after a swallow
My collars aren't stretched out
And more focused on my mouth
[Hook:]
Reinvent yourself! California! (4x)
[Verse 2:]
Ever since my dog died
I haven't had to be at home
I don't just walk around the block
I tick to my own clock
My rent's gotten a little cheaper
I started seeing my friend Peter
He had terrible allergies
It made him a loud breather
Ever since I stopped rapping
I've been totally relaxed
No more hiring a publicist
Or trying to find fat checks
I don't have to pretend
Everything's going so well
One of ten acts
At a venue called Hell
[Hook:]
Reinvent yourself! California! (8x)


One day I was walking down the street to my own drummer
When this fella walks up and said "D used to be a farmer."
No way Jose, ain't you heard of the Teachaz tapes?
You best get out my face before I make you extremely late
For your appointment, appointing you absent
This will make sure that you won't do that again
This will make sure you don't suggest to the KD's
That he should grow greens instead of crushing on MCs
[Hook]
All you need now is some direction
All you need now is some direction
Your whole damn category spread up in a section
All you need now is some direction
Now I can normally jog a mile in about 4:14
After about ten then I pick up a good wind
Started out in Skokie, now I'm near Evanston
Passin' by people, (Hey thanks for the cold wind!)
Until this one fella step up and says "D let's race"
I'm like "Sure buddy, tell me what's the stakes."
He said "5k," I said "done deal"
North Shore to Rainbow Beach see who has wheels
Ready, set, go and of course the D's won
Beat him by ten blocks watch how the money come
Look at the money come, look at the money come, look at the money come
I can look at the money come
[Hook]
Direction, direction, direction, direction...)
[Outro]
You go right, you go right, you go left, you go right
You go right, you go right, you go left, you go right

You go right, you go left
You go left, you go right, you go left, you go right
You go left, you go left, You go up, you go down
You go down, you go left, you go right, you go left
You go up, and go down, and a left, a left, a right
You go right, you go left, you go left, you go up
You go down, you go left, you go right, you go left
You go right, you go left, you go up, you go up

You go right, you go right, you go right, you go right
You go right, you go up, you go up, you go down
You go down, you go up, you go up, you go down
You go down, you go up, you go right, you go right
You go left, you go left, you go left, you go left
You go right, you go down, you go down, you go up

You go up, you go up, you go up, you go up
You go up, you go up, you go right, you go left, you go left
You go right


Ypu
Alright
Yup
My karate is sick
Not at Gymkata levels
But I could at least break bricks
Or at least break plates
Once I found my whimsy
Was like the savage breaking free from crates
Fresh air and tricycle squeaks
Or removing tags from birthday present khaki pleats
Ah, these are gonna look good
Smooth like a starry night
Chillin' on a jeep hood
Firebird logo
Word to messages
Me and my man Patrick breaking through savage stretches
He just wants to dance
I just want a second chance
Perfect times in Denver
Dinner with Spike Lee
Shanghai is really getting built up
Listening to jazz more
I really need to get a job
Maybe start a veggie fest
This puppet show doesn't pay much
On the fringe and outskirts


[Anders Holm]
Alright so, it's the day before the Fourth of July in 1997
There was going to be a huge house party [?] girl in my high school
So I decided to drive down to Indiana and get a shitload of fireworks
Cause you can't have fireworks in Illinois, you gotta go over to Indiana, that's just something we had to do-
[Kenny Dennis]
(it ain't legal!)
To survive on the Fourth
So I''m coming back on the damn [?] going north bound going about 80
[Kenny]
(Hey take it easy!)
In my Dad's station wagon with [?] twisters, roman candles, black cats. These cone shaped fountain things...
Just asking for it
I look to my right...
(*Siren*)
I'm done for; I can't go to the party, probably going to lose my license, who knows what
I pull over, I'm sweating
[Kenny]
(Take it easy.)
Dude comes over to my window, taps on it, I roll it down
[Cop]
(License and registration.)
So I'm going through my stuff, getting my wallet out
And he leans in, and I'm like, "What's this dude about?"
[Cop]
(Uh, what you playing in there? What is that there?)
I'm like, "this is my buddy Kenny"
(Turn it up!)
And it was an unreleased EP he did with the Grim Teacherz called "Da End iz Near"
Nobody had it
And the cop goes:
"Kenny fuckin' Dennis?"
And that was when I met Curtis
[Curtis]
"Uh, go ahead. Take it easy on the streets. These streets ain't nothin' to play with."


[Verse 1: Serengeti]
She was 17, I was 29
It felt fine, it felt like a great dream of mine
Didn't tell her I was married, didn't have the guts
Didn't want my mistake to mess this shit up
Said I was 24, I didn't want to age no more
I bought an exercise machine and put it on the door
The key to a great body is a solid core
I hide my wallet and cell, in my shoe on the floor
[Hook: Yoni Wolf and (Serengeti)]
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (You wouldn't understand it)
Ohh...Ohh!
[Verse 2: Serengeti]
My birthday dinner, she thought that I was 25
Actually, I was 30 on the inside
I had such a double life that I was going mad
Twenty parallel lives when I met her dad
I bought college books and put 'em in a book bag
Made some shit up, about being post-grad
For 10 years I was married to my wife at home
I'm always out of town and troubles with my cellphone
[Hook: Yoni Wolf and (Serengeti)]
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (You wouldn't understand it)
Ohh...Ohh!
[Verse 3: Serengeti]
It's four years later, she finally made 21
I'm 33, she never seen my ID
We got married, but I never got divorced
I'm back and forth like balls on tennis courts
I'm always tired, my wife thinks I'm 29
My other wife thinks I'm out of town all the time
Three mothers, ten brothers, six sisters
Stressful on Thanksgiving and Christmas
[Hook: Yoni Wolf and (Serengeti)]
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (Goddamit)
Ohh (You wouldn't understand it)
Ohh...Ohh!
Ohh ...Ohh!
Ohh ...Ohh!
Ohh ...Ohh!
Ohh...Ohh!


[Verse 1]
There's Derrick, Motley, Corey, and Tommy
Wonderful lady Rhonda, a friend of my ma
Visited there, back when my ma still had hair
We walked around, she gave me the most juiciest pear
It trickled down my pinstripes
Her son Darryl was cool
He had the nicest dirt bike
Pretty chrome
That week really felt like home
I never have to be alone (Yeah!)
[Hook: Serengeti & Kiki Bohemia]
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York
New York
New York
(Hi)
[Verse 2]
There's Carla and Stooley and Linda and Joley
Mommy's boyfriend had a neighbor named Lanoley
We played scully in a beautiful park in Brooklyn
It was so late
The sun was so pretty in Mommy's hair
Puerto Rican dishes shared on the stoops
Most comfortable place to ever envision
[Outro: Serengeti & Kiki Bohemia]
(All the time
You are one of the strange kind)
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends
I have so many friends in New York City
I have so many friends in New York
(All the time, all of the time
You are one of a strange kind)


[Intro: Yoni Wolf]
Got a real buzz to it, but that's alright
[Serengeti]
Quick, let me get drunk as fast as I can
So, I can fall asleep
And pretend to be a different man
(That's fucked up)
You know, the one that’s an architect
Is this a case of the grass is greener or is the shit more fresh?
[Yoni Wolf]
I'd say the latter
[Verse 1: Serengeti]
That’s harsh
Like drowning in a sticky marsh
All your skeleton’s unveiled
Man, this life was dark, like 
Gargamel
The only saving grace was that he did a song with Jel
(How much did he charge you?)
Yo, Geti life, laying next to the sweaty wife
Hey, man, can I borrow your mind? (No!)
I really need a hit, it’s been a long time
Like seedlings growing to be giant pines
I should've stayed in school
Everything was cool
Hey, Yoni
(Yeah?)
I really need a hit
Something quick, this shit has been an embarrassment
I wanna be on film, too, so I hired a film crew
It got expensive
That’s the job
People get hired to do
I also got taken by the gypsies in Berlin, too
No marble, we’re like twins, dark corner in basketball courts with meants
I told her I could get her close to Yoni, I was lying, though
I told her I could get her close to Yoni, I was lying, no, we’re not really homies
(Huh? For real?)
It was getting later
I think she got the picture
She became silent, wouldn’t that be your Geti life?
Laying next to the sweaty wife?
Yoni’s world, laying next to one of Yoni’s girls
[Verse 2]
I always wanted to be on a record label
Always wanted to have my own show on cable
My favorite team is '87 Cubs
I love Hawk Dawson
I never felt awesome!
It’s always been a huge problem
I have a huge nose like that woman on Blossom
Peeps to Jel and my man Odd Nosdam
I live in Chicago, but in California often
(On the middle west)
Always wished my name was Otto
Everybody has a dream that they'll win the Lotto
Or at least move to Abu Dhabi
I made it to the orange belt on Shotokan karate
I’m drinking some, buddy
Wish I had a friend or a decent hobby
(Shit.)
My favorite show is tennis!
(Have you been listening to me?!)
Often on tilt, Often off balance
I'm getting older, so I hang around MILFs
So I hang around-
Movies by myself and feel intense guilt
I write a lot!
My head will explode!
Do a lot of music, shit's written in secret code
Catch me on a commode, explode
Geti life, laying next to the sweaty wife
YEAAHHHHHHH


[Verse 1]
I was the happiest man in 
Glassell Park
Dark
Ice life, nine cold
Chopped from a door mind hold
Forgot all the time
Since I bought these cloaks
And waistband belt ropes
I can't really speak unless I'm dreamin' of Elise
Who gives a shit when you're blitzed all the time, fool
This shit wears thin
Like staying in an inn pool
I was feeling clean
Like I built a limousine
And bought a little ketamine to dream
[Verse 2]
I was the happiest man in Glassell Park
Divorce is the new wedding
Stop is the new start
LL and Art [?] hit me on the backbone
Call you on the grunk four and meet you in the dingdome
Metaphor rap man
Tired last rap clan
Hang it up
It's not enough
To wake up on a night stand
The happiest man near Glassell Parks, lakes
Sit on the couch, watch a movie, eat a whole cake
A nice rom-com
Set in a southern state
Twist it with a [?] towel
Parmesan spaghetti plate
The happiest man in Glassell Park
In history...


[Verse 1]
Disturbed hives, Queen wasn't content
Itchy eyes stacks of shirts
Boxes beneath the piano bench
Baby stayed wet in the coroner
Dead Chia Pet
Cleanin' up
The spring, people clean up
Throw away a lot of things
Old boots
Terrarium, old new terrarium
Dead Chia Pet
Itchy eyes
Animal print boxers
Animals in disturbed hives
Queen wasn't that content
Queen wasn't that content
Queen wasn't that content
Queen wasn't that content
[Hook]
I'm a fan of the at home life
Every now and then I can't stop crying
[Bridge]
If there's a god, then he must not know me
Hasn't even take a glance this way
Take a glance this way
Is it today or yesterday
Tell me: Why am I still shaking?
[Hook]
[Outro]
Disturbed hives, Queen wasn't content
Shirts beneath the piano bench
The baby stayed wet
Old, Dead Chia Pet
This spring
This spring time


[Verse]
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
One time, this kid, Bradly, left me with a broken shoulder
I had a new telephoto lenses, taking photographs of his second older sister, Gwen
Her form was divine, her blinds were slightly open as I hid behind a street sign
Then I moved behind a giant pine, she did yoga every night at about nine
Bradly wasn’t that tough, he had a Kansas city starter coat, his father sold soaps
The kind that look like shells, he dealt with distributers and chains of motels
Imagine how Gwen smells, her one legged king pigeon pose and her workout clothes
Inspiration like a muse, also, on the flying crow, she never wore shoes
That’s why I bought this new Canon at the china beach, pack up and head to Gwen’s street
Shit was an I.S., very ritualistic, she wore the same sweats
Warm up sweats, they were turbo green, I’d often think to myself “If I only had a trampoline”
Then she took off her pants, these photographs were our first found romance
I was only twelve, Bradly broke my shoulder when we fell off these garage shelves
We were just horsing around, I felt my shit pop when I hit the damn garage ground
I showed Gwen the photos years later when she was back in town
[Outro]
I took photographs of you, when you were younger
And now, I’m showing them to you


[Verse 1: Serengeti]
This romance is knitted quilts
And very soft strings of yarn
Sharing plates of spinach parm
And never having to move your arm
Charm is charm but yours is more like
Overflowing candy drawers
Returning from the greatest war
I adore our rapport
We feel like batteries in toys
Otters and their silly ploys
A haunted house and scary noise
The fashions of a teddy boy
To cook with sherry and juices from stems of poison pigeon berry
Romantic hugs and Finnish ferries
Mountain blue and green canaries
[Hook]
I’d prefer if you were around
I’d prefer if you were around
[Verse 2: Serengeti]
We toasted sweet burger buns
That time we fell in love in Schtad
Fed each other Shish Kabobs
I love you like an angry god
Alaskan cod and silly quips
I wish you’d leave that man you’re with
We’ll get a place like in Peru
You’ll meet me up like oysters do
Turn cold like pigeon flu
Undercover secret life
Hidden like a switchblade
The arm that hides the face of nights
And this is all that I can have
Romantic New York City cabs
And weeks and weeks and you can’t talk
Cancel plans and lonely walks
Plans and lonely walks
[Hook x2]


Clatter of washing plates
Dinner was so good
Soaps like cereal
And living room wall wood
Home is the best place
Tending to fish tanks
Hiding your hidden traits
I hid in your hidden traits
Clatter of washing plates
Dinner was so good
Soaps like cereal
And living room wall wood
Home is the best place
Tending to fish tanks
Hiding your hidden traits
The cover of washing plates
Hid in you hidden traits
Hid in your hidden traits
Hid in your hidden traits
If I could redo it all
I'd redo it all
And say that you look nice tonight
If i could redo it all
I'd redo it all
And say that you look nice tonight
And say that you look beautiful
And make you smile bright tonight
And feel like the saint you are
And flowers grow towards the moon
And say that you sound beautiful
I'd say that you sound beautiful
If i could redo it all
I'd redo it all
And say that you look nice tonight
And say that you look nice tonight


[Anders Holm]
So, things started to really slow down for me in LA
Didn't really have anybody calling
But you know, what's up what's down
So I thought why don't I get away from all this
Leave LA
Get back to Chicago
Pick up the phone
Call Kenny
And see what he's up to
And he ain't up to shit
[Kenny Dennis]: I am up to shit
Which was good because I'm like...
[Kenny Dennis]: I do a lot of things
Let's do something
Let's get together
Why don't we go on tour?
Why don't we start a little group and start rapping together?
He was fully down and I'm like
Well let's go
[Kenny Dennis]
Ok, let's go do this
Bet big, win big
Lose big
Can't break even
No Even Stevens
You gotta bet big!
Win big, lose big


[Verse 1]
I sound secret like a whisper, fake like a denture
Disappointing like the hard times of your mentor
Rocky roads, little jungle toads
Secret like the shit was written in a cloaky code
Can’t read it, talk to me like Curtis Loader
Rap shit don’t work, become a chauffeur
Know the streets, stadiums and tiered seats
Pop the truck driver, turn up Bon Iver
Disappointing dash spokes, wanted to be a scuba coach, expand like James Polk
But instead, after Bon Iver, Papa Roach
Sir, don’t forget your coat
I was a mentor, yo, talk to me
[Hook]
Yeah, where you been, honey?
Yeah, where you been, baby?
[Verse 2]
Yeah, work hard or very rich
Keep it together like a ten stitch
Enjoy yourself like a sexy bitch
NBA wives arguing outside
A sense of beauty and pride
Watching women fight for guys
Whatever, people all have their faults
Like skimming a couple grand for your company’s bank vault
And you were trusted, left the upper brass disgusted
Took years for the company to get readjusted
Or your wife having a secret family in Gary
Her second spouse kind of looks like Neneh Cherry
Whatever, cut the lady some slack
I’ve been getting bent back
Peace to sudden impact
Where you been?
[Hook]
Where you’ve been?
[Outro]
Baby, bank vault, secret, baby
How come you smell like a [?]?
Yo where you been?
[?]
Yo where you been honey?
-baby, yeah
Yo where you been baby?
Yo where you been baby?
Yo where you been honey?
-baby, yeah


[Verse 1: Sufjan Stevens]
I don't want resistance
Put your hands in fire
Realise, realise energy
It's only meant to burn a while
All I want is justice
Put your hands in mine
You and I you and I energy
We're never meant to dignify
Was it dream was it dream energy?
The vision of a horror scene
I blame you for everything
You didn't even try to fight
Show your face my sweetness
Put your hand in fire
Make it right make it right energy
The punishment should fit the crime
[Verse 2: Serengeti]
Dinosaur museum day
Follow me through different wings
We were supposed to be the kings
But we were doing dope too much
Now we take jumbo jets
Fly above the hinterlands
German like Wellendorf
Well enough to paint a wharf
We made it baby gothic wooden churches
Vistas full of daisies
We can feel ourselves
Golden pendants poking through lapels
Sharp like a sweater vest
Together like we end in ‘S’
A winter in Klindonia
I can’t believe we were such a mess
Let’s raise your glass and toast the plants
Hundreds of waving palms
Thousands of recorded psalms
Psalms that could have made us calm
Psychotic like savannah cats
Socialites and social apps
Beautiful view of Carnes hill
Backstage and on the bill
Back when we were doing dope
Hide beneath the onion plant
Bags where the filters go
Wasn’t making coffee then
I apologise for sloppy flow
But we back we return
[Chorus]
We are recolouring
X4
[Verse 3: Serengeti]
Sneaking through sister’s purse
That was money for the water bill
Pretty endless perfect days
Sun kissed vacation caves
Weaves like the Lindis Pass
Foothill or mountain grass
They’re large like a St. Bernard
A lover’s kind warm regards
Winds along the coastal bluff
Push it along like chide
Toasty family story time
Acoustic noise sound design
Swamp pop is Zydeco
Pterodactyl beak and claw
Films viewed in 3D
Popcorn in honey tea
German like the Audi FOX
Stash spot dirty socks
One above the hinterlands
In the sun like violet chimps
I dress like the lovers’ share
Vacation breeze sun hair
Everything seems perfect now
I guess I had to go there
Dinosaur museum chair
Jeepers we were acting rare
Sharp marble sloping stairs
Taking us to anywhere
As if we really cared
Dinosaur museum where
Double double triple dare
Yeah let’s get out of here
Yeah let’s get out of here
But we back, we return
[Chorus]
We are recolouring
X4
[Verse 4: Sufjan Stevens]
All I want is witness
Put your hands in fire
Make it right make it right energy
The light divides the brightest star
I don't want resistance
Put your hands in fire
Make it right make it right energy
The punishment should fit the crime
[Outro]
I am recolouring
X5


Unintelligible man!
Metamorphosis man!
Hey, right now!
[Verse 1: unknown rapper]
Teeth turn to dust
College was a bust
Never owned a car but my feet when I'm in a rush
Huck Finn, no wrath
Cancerous sunbaths
Gotta find a cave to retire with a skin graft
Never earned shit
Lineage never rich
Family tree with no roots
Floating limbs in a swimming dish
When it floods (do the math)
Would've never did drugs
11-years old in the woods my first coke buzz
Rode home on my huffy
Now I'm Evil Knievel (yeah!)
Paradox the son and father
Always trying to hide the evil bottle (that's my shit right there)
----- with draining grotto
Showed him how to bend the box
Blow it pirate new model
[Chorus: Serengeti] (Repeat 2x)
My mic's are even nice
Forget the cable man cuz nice knows how to splice
At nights be watchin Spice
At nights be watchin Spice
Nice... (Repeat 3x)
[Verse 2: Serengeti]
That's it...
In the summer of 2002
Geti formed his own crew
Known as the grown pounds
Known for that down home sound
I've always been around my hometown like Mo Brown
Never had enough but had enough to slow down
(Shit... shit...)
Only a few know how
Like my Uncle Larry and Tony have known to do now
I spit that fashion rap so the ladies get down
A far cry from my new crew in my old hometown
When I used to push the huffy
Geti got lucky
Geti flows ugly, mad gangster like Bugsy
Cocaine and pain meds
Used to be half-dead
Now I feel light and bright just like a moped, yeah
[Chorus] (Repeat 2x)
Nice... (Repeat 2x)
