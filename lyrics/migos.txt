Now I rock the stage and I get paid, it's 50k in my resume
Remember hitting licks in the Honda
Now I'm riding round president tints on a escalate
Picking hard ball like the Braves
Rocking out shows on the gravey
I told my mama we made it, Harriet Tubman chains no slavery
Breaking the sweat like the 80's
Play with the water like Navy

3 mics we don't need a fucking deal
[Hook]
[verse 3: Offset]
Back in the day a flamingo

Ducking and dodging the cops Ray G to me Offset stop
Offset never listen had to do a sentence when i got out we took to the top
They say when you worth a milli thats a different feeling
Wanna know benji im the definition

Cooking the dope will get bagged like a replay
Running circles around you squares no relay
[Hook]

The pack was just here did you see it
The plug he be here any second now
If he didn't then something went down
We losing our bags, gotta go to the stash

That's why they mad
[Hook]
[Verse 2 : Takeoff]

Ridin' around with that Scotty in brand new Bugattis

[Hook]


[Prehook – Takeoff]
Baby keep on calling my phone
Wanna know when I’ma come home
She telling me that I be fucking bitches
And I told her that she trippin'
Cause you must be high off shrooms
Want to investigate me when I come in the room
Talking bout where you been at
And why you ain’t pick up your phone?
I’ve been on the road stacking money
Talking bout I treat her Macaulay Culkin
Cause she stay at home alone
But it’s all good though
[Hook – Takeoff]
When I come in with them M&Ms
And tell you to count up this big bankroll
Everything good though
Told me stop trapping but you told me
That you wanna get up out the hood though
All my hard work, it done paid off
Shawty stayed down since day one
Got to keep her by my side like my Tommy gun
Put on my jewelry baby, shine like the sun
[Verse 1 – Takeoff]
Ok I be on a private jet to [?] to just pick up some Benjamin Franklins
From some people I ain’t never seen
The OGs keep telling me boy you gon make history
Told my bitch you better ask about a nigga in these streets
We can go to MIA to see the palm trees
Lamborghini, man we pull up on Daytona Beach
When I look into her eyes I make her panties leak
She still probably won’t believe so we taking a trip to go to Belize
But it’s all good though
[Hook]
[Verse 2 – Quavo]
Quavo talk to em' ooh
You know you’re shining baby
Looking like some VVS diamonds baby
Want to thank your mama, my god what a creation
Wanna welcome you into my mansion with an invitation
I’m a young nigga, ain’t used to relations
So you know I ain’t patient
She told me she black and she Asian
Look how she walk when she came in
She hate it when I got to go on the road
But she like it when I bring back the hundos
She cooking spaghetti and gumbo
Mama told me don’t eat no sauce from no hoes
But you know a nigga really like you
But you tryna shut down my empire
That’s my lifestyle, like the wire
You too bipolar, baby you fire
[Prehook + Hook]
[Verse 3 – Offset]
I had to fly out to Vegas to show her dad I’m a player
I’m not used to cuffing the women but I’m gonna save her
Booty fatter than Deelishis
, when I hit her we lay 
up
We together, get up on our knees and we say our prayers
Ain’t no trials and tribulations, we having some patience
25 she got two cars, and a house that she pays for
So what else could I ask for, first night I was mad, I done smashed
And that taught me a lesson, lil mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it’s too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I’m kissing on her body, start to melt her
I be murdering the pussy, I should have another felon
We sticking together just like we salt and pepper
But it's all good though
[Prehook + Hook]


[Hook: Quavo]
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Stop claimin' me bitch, you know you lyin'
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
You can have that little bitty bitch, you know she ain't mine
Most of these bitches ain't mine
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Most of these bitches they ain't mine, nigga
You can have that bitch, I swear she ain't no dime, nigga
She no quarter, I won't spoil her
Think she Moses when she cross the water
Immigrant, she cross the border
How the fuck niggas say they can afford my 
business
?
It's the same niggas rockin' Jordans
Pull up Trailblazer, like I'm in Portland
White boy shoot better than Kyle Korver
300 Spartans, my niggas immortal
Sellin' fishes, I got Nemo and Dory
In the swamp with gators like I'm in Florida
Tryna get rich like Richard Porter
Takin' that Pyrex pot and glass bowl
And stickin' my hand in that water
If the bitch try to take a quarter
It gon' be a homicide, 
It's cheaper to leave her
But it's gon' cost you some money if you wanna spoil her
She got that Aquafina, call her water
She wanna ride on top of my Sequoia
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
You cuffin' your ho and I'm fuckin' your ho
Like a light, she can switch
Sloppy toppy, eat it, licorice
Wipe the gloss off your lip when you suck the dick
Why you claimin' a nigga? You know you ain't mine
It's time to cut her off, it's 'bout that time
Why the fuck you keep lyin'? You a little fine
I'm not wastin' my time, only spend with dimes
She got the audacity say that we're married
Chasin' a nigga like Tom & Jerry
Look how she standin', she Halle Berry
I laugh at the bitch like I'm Tyler Perry
Your birthday, be singin' like Mary Mary
She say she a virgin, don't got a cherry
I'm not fuckin' no bitch if the pussy hairy
I'm passin' your bitch like a Hail Mary
She wanna claim me cause I'm famous
Mexico groupie bitches, they be dangerous
Immigrant bitches, they don't speak our language
I don't fight over bitches, I leave your shirt painted
Innocent bitches, they look like a model
Shaped like a bottle, they suck and they swallow
Lil' mama, she bad so niggas gon' holla
And shouts out lil' mama, she only fuck ballers
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Quavo]
You can have, she ain't mine
No, I don't want her
I don't want her
Yes she's foreign, I caught her in Barcelona
Got this Spanish lil' mama, like to drink Corona
But you can have her, she gon' instantly bend it over
Cuffin' bitches, I ain't worried 'bout it
Cause everybody know about it
I pulled up to my mansion in the Audi
Smashed and then she outtie
Say she from New York, I had to call my nigga Rosh
He told me that she goin' in, she got that sloppy toppy
So you know what I did?
I got her suckin' me up in a Benz
She told me she wanted a threesome
I told that lil' bitch call her friend
When I pull, light the light, the Forgis slide
You must be blind if this money you think ain't mine
[Hook]


[Intro: Quavo]
Ay, ay, count that money up, add it up!
Ay, run that check up, add it up!
Ay, count that knot right here, add it up!
Ay, run and go get that money over there, add it up!
Ay, go get the truckload, get the truckload, add it up!
Migos! Go!
[Hook: Quavo]
Got hundreds of peons, they comin' in, on Tonka trucks
Fuck nigga, he don't believe me, he could go add it up
Add it up (x12)
The bricks just came in, the molly came in
The white just came in, you don't believe it, fuck nigga, add it up
Add it up (x9)
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Add it up like a new calculator
In the trap with two guns like I'm Tomb Raider
Hop on the track with no pen or paper
We blowin' up, I got that detonator
You could add up the dope like accountants
Put that dope in the water, don't drown it
Add it up right now, bet it motherfuckin' lookin'
Like a nigga livin' up on a mountain
I dreamed I woke up in Phantoms, naked bitches in a mansion
I did my calculations, most of you rappers is imitatin'
They back on the island, I'm contemplatin'
Should I shoot to kill in my situation?
Mama said "Quavo, better stay patient!"
The dirt that I done you add up the cases
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Beep! Fff!
That's that money machine and it's addin' up!
The trap is a bakery, whippin' and cookin'
The dope, I send it straight to Canada!
Young Offset trappin' in your area
Jungle fever, got the white and I marry her
I see Justin Bieber, the ghost is way scarier
Hit a juug, fifty bags of the good cannabis
All these other conversations irrelevant
If you ain't talkin' bout Benjamin Frank
Gold fingers like a trophy and painting
Got the 45., turn you to a sharp painting
My pockets is healthy, Zanotti Giuseppe
My money is stretching, my money athletic
Tyler Perry, makin' movies, they epic
I'm not the one from Cuba, that's my necklace
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
We fucked the world up when we dropped that "Versace"
It topped the chart, nigga, so add it up
"Versace", it got us a M and 'em
Don't believe me, fuck nigga, then count it up
Stealing my flow, we come to your show
Put you on camera and we embarrass ya
Fuck your management, and your manager
You is a amateur, choppa'll damage ya
Trappin' and cappin', had to make it happen
Trapper turned rapper, my mama happy
On the block trappin', don't serve undercovers
Snakes in that grass, they gon' get you on trouble
If I get jammed, put that on my mama
That I won't tell on my brother
In the bando and I'm countin' the fuck out the p's
Got rich off a pot and some water
[Hook]


Intro:
Seen you last night
At the club, for the first time
In about a year, damn, girl I
The look on your face
Didn't say that
Things were going the way
That you planned
When I saw you for the last time
 (x2)
Hook:
Know sometimes you wish that you was with me
 (Ah)
If we had a baby, what it would be (Ah)
Is your bank account, empty (Ah)
You can call me babe, anytime
[Verse 1: Sean Garrett]
Ain't gone lie (Ain't gone lie)
You ran up 
I ain't expect to see you
You start talking (talking)
Saying shit ain't straight with him
You bring it up (saying)
You miss the way it used to be
Ain't gone lie, but I moved on so far from here
You asking me (honestly)
I ain't got no answer
Is it true?
That I'm blamed for that
I ain't got no answer
If I told you
All my set backs
All the shit I went through
I just buried my momma
Two months after I caught you
Hey, You heard I got that check
Hey, and I ain't trying to look back
I hope that maybe you chose
To take a damn good care
I ain't wish you no better
But that ain't none of my business, no
Hook (x2)
[Verse 2: Quavo]
I know that you wish that you had a young nigga like me
I know that you sad
I know you praying the Lord for a nigga like me
You missing the shopping sprees
You missing the diamonds all in your rings
I pull up in Jags and Rovers and Bentleys
I know that you miss the front seat
Your bitches, they asking about me
Wanna know what a young nigga do
Cause the see my girl in that red dress
And they say that could be you, in it
Everytime they see Quavo, they say that boy pursue
(Like a real) 
Just look at yourself in the mirror
I know you wish I was there
That Porshe, Panamera, you know that car was your favorite
My momma she told me you crazy
I know you hate that I made it
So many chains, look like slavery
I hope I make you go crazy
Throw a hundred dollars for your step-baby
You can have that old ass Mercedes
Hook (x2)
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
God damn, back then
Your momma, she wasn't fucking with me
Taking a trip out the city, go quick on that Brittney
She thicker than Jiffy
The Louis, the Gucci, the Prada, the Fendi
Versace, and Givenchy
Know lil' mamma gone miss me
I was the Santa on Christmas
She talking about having my baby
But told me stop whipping them babies
I told her you crazy
When you see me pulling up in that drop top
I made it
She calling my phone, she come in my home
Knock on that booty, I'm gone
Met a bitch, said her name Nia Long
Smoking that good, ching chong
Came a long way, neighborhood star
And I'm on the top of Worldstar
Back then , nigga, looking at a star
Now a nigga shine with the stars
Red bottom got blood on the floor
Metta World Peace, got that elbow
She won't stop calling my phone
She hear me everyday on the radio
Hook (x2)


[Verse 1 – Ray J]
See it in your eyes when you’re looking at me
Goddamn, Imma burn a hole through the middle of your Givenchy
You ain’t ready for this beast I be
[?] with a little Cognac, a little something in my swisher sweet
[Bridge – Ray J]
I don’t understand why I feel this way
Got me feeling like I'm in outer space
Swear I always been the type in the club that'll hold shit down
Caught up in the matrix, so far gone, don’t wake me now
[Hook - Dria]
Don’t keep me waiting, I’m anticipating
Come meet me baby, in this dream
You and me
I be the [?], come home when you need me
Got my arms wide open, I mean my legs wide open with me
Got my legs open like an ATM
Got my legs open like an ATM
Hundreds in a bank roll, got me open 24
XO got me kinda throwed, kinda throwed, kinda throwed
[Verse 2 - Quavo]
Beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
Like Michael Jackson, bout to beat it up
Got her legs open like an ATM, so I told her cash out on this spatula
You the baddest bitch in the club, right?
So I hit her with a left like fight night
In the club tight, diamonds shine on bright
Looking like I work at [?]
I’m the king, baby call me Elvis
Can a nigga see below your pelvis?
I didn’t come alone, I came with the felons
She want to take it to the next level, I’m a trend setter
Baby living better, she want to see if I got real cheddar
My pockets so fat, look like nutty professor
The blue Benji’s make her feel better
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Ray J]
Damn she wetter than a tsunami
Sweating like a motherfucker, hotter than a goddamn [?]
She’s a rider like a Ducati
If you want to come and get it, spit it
I'll eat it like an edamame
[Bridge]
[Verse 4 – Takeoff]
Takeoff a young rich nigga
Christian Louboutin sweater
Gold toed, these are Maison Margielas
Pockets sloppy, [?] change the weather
Slippery whip out, I'm Cinderella
I can make it rain in any weather
I look like Frank Lucas in the chinchillas
Pull up in the Bentley, you niggas weak
I'm a veteran, you just a beginner
[Verse 5 – Offset]
Offset!
She wet like Pacific, her head is terrific
Lil mama, she gifted
She suck on the dick, baby girl do not kiss it
Eat it up, eat it up, like I am jiffy
Intelligent independent, she been fucking with me from the very beginning
Church girl, when she with me she sinning
I’m granting her wish, she calling me a genie
Got my finger on her panty line
Lil mama bad, you should see her mom
She looking sexy when she chew on gum
Come with Offset, baby have some fun
3 2 1, lil mama she the bomb!
In her Birkin bag, she keep my gun
Bitch is sucking and she number one
She Brazilian, not American (Foreign!)
[Hook]


[Hook: Quavo]
Mansion full of bachelors
Flippin' all these hoes like a spatula
Nah, you know I don't like no camera
Nah, your bitch she like an animal attackin' us
She won't leave me 'lone, she love the bachelor
Migos, young rich nigga, we some bachelors
Bachelors, bachelor, bachelors, ooh bachelor
Bachelors, bachelors, uh, bachelors, Migos some bachelors
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Quavo, I am a bachelor
Look at the way I'm dabbin' like a pastor (I'm dabbin' ain't it)
I am a bachelor
Rockin' the shows, smashin' hoes right after
You know I'm a bachelor
Got your bitches workin', calling me master
Came from the bottom and now I got guala
Turn the page, my nigga, we on the next chapter
Trapper turned rapper
Graduated, now a nigga's a bachelor
Flippin' your ho like a spatula
Don't get me wrong, I still whip up with spatulas
Your ho was creeping like tarantulas
Migos we don't like the cameras
We find out that we can make millions with it
So we started flexin' like bachelors
Came from stashing money in a ceilin'
Young niggas why don't you wanna be bachelors?
They came from kicking doors, drinkin' purp from the bowl
And now we taking trips to Africa, Africa
Niggas say that they are entrepreneurs
I go and see the millions that you pursuin'
Statistics ain't black and white, what is you doin'?
Top the charts every time we drop a new one
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Migos, we some bachelors, 
we pull up in tarantulas
Whippin' the dope, we the Terminator break the spatula
Get the pack and then I wrap it up and then I bag it up
If I catch a mug I'll take a private jet to Canda
Promoters ain't got my money, I'm shootin' up your manager
Fuck it my nigga, we shootin' innocent bystanders
My niggas on top of the mountain, no Grand Canyon
Pull up with choppas and make a nigga call the ambulance
Drinkin' on Actavis and I'm rollin' up cannabis
Hoes runnin' 'round the lobby geekin' up and their panties wet
I had a cuban link and Rolex before the rap shit
I just adapt to the trap cause that's my habitat
I'm in the corner catchin' the work like a cornerback
Runnin' to the money, my nigga, think I'm a running back
Niggas still trappin' quarters, make 'em give their quarter back
Forty pointers in my Breitling, oh that's what you lookin' at?
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Pull up to the mansion, 50 story, hundred rooms
She lookin' at my diamond solution, that ain't no shrooms
Hold a nigga rest and beat his head in with a broom
Had that brotha be flyin' like caterpillars out cocoons
Penthouse elevator, it'll elevate yah
Pull up in the Bentley, think you seen a fuckin' Jeeper Creeper
Got that 9 on my waist like a two-way beeper
Got that purse on your head, nigga like a alopecia
I'm a bachelor, I got a oil factory in Africa
Trapper turned rapper then rapper turned into a massacre
Then beat a nigga, stomp a nigga, I will not account
From the beginning these bitches, they wasn't shit, they ate the apple
I had a warrant with the sack, the police tried to make a tackle
Green Bay with the green, vacuum seal it, I'm a Packer
Just because you rap about it, you are not a trapper
Just because you got a milli, you are not a bachelor
[Hook: Quavo]


[Intro: Quavo]
Hit 'em with that sack, uh oh!, fumble
Little nigga smokin' mid, give that pack back to your uncle
[Hook: Quavo]
I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man, I'm the baker's man
Egg beater in sight, (Whip) put it in my hand (skuuuurt)
I'm the baker's man, (skuuuurt) I'm the baker's man, (skuuuurt) I'm the baker's man
Egg beater in sight, (Whip) put it in my hand (skuuuurt)

[Verse 1: Quavo]

In the huddle calling plays just like Christian Ponder (touchdown!)
Hit 'em with that sack, uh-oh, fumble! (fumble!)
Little nigga smokin' mid, give that pack back to your uncle (mids!)
Got a bad bitch, yeah, she asian like Kitana (she bad!)
Got a scope on the sniper rifle, I see the anaconda (I see 'em!)
Talk to Scooter in Dekalb ,  Quavo, he said "you a road runner"
Free my nigga Offset
, 
ASAP, so a young nigga can get back to the money
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Egg beater my left, Pyrex pot my right
Baking soda on the shelf,
 
beat that pot like Winky Wright
Ever since my daddy left, Mama taught me "son do right"
50 niggas to my left, 50 niggas to my right
50 chickens come a day, 50 chickens come a night
When I whip my work today, They gone find yo ass tonight
All my niggas on go, you know they gone smash on sight
That shit you rap and talk 'bout, nigga, you know thats my life
[Hook]

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Trapping in the vacant

Flip it like a sandal, foreign bitch she look like J.Lo
Get a brick from Venezuelo, meet the plug his name is Pedro
[Hook]

I'm stacking my money like pringles
Sipping on sprite and codeine,

Her girlfriend Chinese, sipping on lean and popping a bean
Diamonds come from Africa, sipping on lean and smoking loud
Feel like I'm on salvia

Or should I smoke gas and sip medicine
They vote on me like I'm the president
I'm counting on Bedloo to pick out my mamacita for my photoshoot
I'm overdue I'm rocking Versace with chains so how can they notice you
Kicking it old school 20 chains on Mr.T fool
How many hundos, should I bring out the bando hit Bedloo
[Hook]
[Verse 2:Takeoff]

32 bricks of gold, Karl Malone
Lookin' at my Breitling, it got VS-1 stones
Lately lot of you niggas been rockin' rhinestones
Talkin' 'bout you on the block, Macaulay Culkin, home alone
Takin' a trip to go pick up that pack and we pull up in Bentleys
Walkin' around with that sack, no 6, nigga walking with a 50
It's Migo gang, QC the label, fuck niggas better get with it
After my show, I'm on top of your ho, nigga autographin' bitches titties
Travelin' around the globe, I was told not to sell my soul
For the price of fame and never fold
Had to 
jump
 behind the internet
A nigga takin' chains, Debo
24k on my toes
My Maison Margiela's, they rose gold
Trappin' and dabbin', I trap in the rain, sleet, or snow
[Hook: Rick Ross]
[Verse 4: Offset]
Drug deala, gotta keep the 9 milla
You scary just like "Thriller", thinkin' about buyin' a buildin'
Finessin' the plug for the work
I cross him over, no dribble
Sippin' Rose after the day I had a court date
Tried to fuck lil mama, I don't really like no foreplay
Talkin' all that shit, I'll put a price all on your toupee
I hit him in the mouth, he thought he had a damn toothache
Both of you niggas are too fake
They watchin' a nigga like Blu-Ray
You talkin' 'bout that blow but you can't be from in the kitchen
Whippin' up Alicia Keys
You say that you got the big money
But really your money is sesame seeds
I got this bitch named Valerie, she bring me bricks from Sicily
My neck is flooded and my double cup is mudded
The streets made me a villain, out that bowl, I made a million
[Hook: Rick Ross]
[Outro: Rick Ross]
Black bottles and the gold chains
Wearin' gold from the cocaine
Boil kilo in the crockpot
'Nother drug dealer on the car lot

Gotta watch for them snake niggas plotting
Young rich nigga

I ain't seen you in two years so how I fuck with you?
I ain't even gon' touch you I'ma let my man's get you
I pull up and pop in the trunk and it looking like hopscotch, big blocks
Remember me hitting the juugs and licks, and ducking and dodging the cops
I feel like 2Pac, it's me against the world and I can't be stopped
Just me in the drop, came from holes in my sock, and now I got guap
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Gruow, gruow, gruow we got body parts
I don't need no body guard, I just use my face card
In the kitchen frying fishes, got to come with tartar sauce
Call me Pastor Takeoff, healing niggas Peter Popoff
I'm A1 nigga no steak sauce
Baking the birdies, I'm having a bake-off
Extorting these niggas and money they pay off
These niggas got work but ain't working they late off
I hide body parts like I'm Jeffrey Dahmer
A living legend, Ronald McDonald
My wrist terminator, but I am no Arnold
Football Xans, I call 'em Hey Arnold
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Fuck nigga talking hit 'em with extensions
Throw 'em in the river now the nigga missing
Fuck nigga tripping I'm payin' attention
I hit 'em with semi's he don't even see it
If I catch a body I'm gonna be innocent
Clear the whole scene and I'm leaving no witnesses
Everybody get it even civilians
The only people that I spare is the children
I'm sending you niggas take away your body parts
Karate chop that nigga like it's martial-arts
Shot that nigga left 'em at the park
Put the pussy nigga on a milk carton
My choppa banana-clipped, got a knife
Don't roll the dice nigga you risk your life
I'm pouring up lean on your grave-site
I throw him the bullet he catch it like Jerry Rice
[Verse 4: Machine Gun Kelly]
Ugh, fuck a bitch cause it's Thug Life
Smoking good cause my plug right
200k sold on my debut release
200 felons locked up from the team
Popping 200 bottles the day they release
Yes, I am deceased, meaning I'm raiding from all of these sheets
Get Rich or Die Tryin' keep that on repeat
And all these bitches is trying to get on me
And I fuck all of them hoes, got 2 cell phones, can't none of them call me

[Hook x4]


[Verse 1: Quavo]
These bitches see a young nigga

Got a AK finna start drumming
You was talking shit behind my back
But now here a nigga you ain't sayin' nothin'
Young rich nigga live forever, my trap game A1 clever
You say that I'm broke how dare ya'
I ain't never goin' broke never ever
Your arms and your legs I sever

Quavo too hot like a kettle
Young nigga and I keep the heavy metal
[Hook: Quavo]
Adios, adios, adios

Young rich nigga I take a toast
Finessin' Pablo, he gotta go
Up on the boat, finessin' Pablo out his O's
Meetin' up with Carlito

[Intro: Quavo]
Migo, we in here
I don’t know what language you're speaking
Every time you see us we get larger and larger
I don’t understand the lingo
[Hook:]
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Everytime you see us, we get richer and richer
Everytime we see you, you get broker and broker
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Brokanese, you speak Brokanese
Down on your knees, you speak Brokanese
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Brokanese, Brokanese
Talking Brokanese, I take yo' bitch
 
and broke her knees
Brokanese, Brokanese
You’re speaking Brokanese like : Can I have a dollar please?
I'm Hercules
, 
you're Brokales
Extortion we want it, so bring that money back to me
WWE, you boys jabronies
, 
GLAW! GLAW! GLAW!
I come with the chopper feeling like Tony
You niggas is cloning, copy me
Then you look at us, like you ain’t did nothing wrong
You got the nerve to bite the swag, then try to get us on a song
No fuck nigga, we don't rock like that
That's how niggas go broke like that
If you wanna make millions, then join QC independent
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
"Bon appétit", it’s time to eat
Beat the pot like a nigga boxing bob and weave
I'm whippin' a quarter key
A whole thing
I don’t talk your language ‘cause you're talking Brokanese
You broke down to your knees
Hold up freeze
You ain't got no money in your pocket don't talk to me
No comprende I talk Benji
Whippin' the Anna Nicole and Lindsay
No off-days, everyday payday
My diamonds looking like KK (white)
You broke and asking for favors
Young nigga I got 40 acres
Mansion house so damn big, I don't talk to nobody
I ain't got no neighbors
My neck is cold as a glacier
I fucked her, you should've save her
We're ballin', you're not a player
Front row, courtside at the Lakers
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I don't understand you, you speak Brokanese
Never play piano but I whip with lots of keys
Trappin' and cappin' the fishes
Bando smell like Captain D's
Talking to my plug, Jackie Chan in Japanese
Private jet to Belize
, 
smoking OG Christmas trees
You niggas ain't speaking my language
Ain't got a dollar you're so Brokanese
Why you niggas pocket watching
You need to be stacking that broccoli
I am the father and you are my son
I'm mister Miyagi and that's why you copy me
You niggas so broke it's killing me
That was embarrassing, really ridiculous
A nigga still on the block
Selling them quarters and mention my niggas been dealing it
I travel overseas, I water whip in The Bahamas
In Australia I'm the crocodile hunter
In Africa in the jungle
[Hook]


[Intro]
Migo!
Sup Zay' ?
They can't fuck with QC
[Hook: Quavo]
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me (No way!)
You niggas will never be bigger than me
These niggas ain't built like me (Not at all!)
Niggas ain't built like me, these niggas ain't built like me
Bet you ain't never seen no young nigga
Fucked up the profit get it back, they ain't built like me
[Verse 1: Quavo]
These niggas ain't built like me
I can turn a whole nick into a mother fucking key
Look at you nigga you ain't never been an OG
Nigga I ain't choose to trap, nigga trap chose me
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee"
That's the late great words of Muhammad Ali
Gotta move real smooth, if the feds watch me
Gotta hit him real hard if a nigga try me
"Boom! Boom! Boom!"
Can we fix it, like Bob the Builder?
Break in my trap and I kill ya (Pswiw!)
These nigga ain't built like my nigga
Down in Rose West side and Williams (Free Willie Mack!)
That is the moral of the story
You niggas can't built like that with no courage
You niggas out here really hurting
Locking the block down like Richard Sherman
Gone!
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me
Hit the club, diamonds glowing in the back of VIP
Straight through the line, nigga don't serve me
Give the wine to the bitches , cause I'm pouring up lean
Smoking OG like it's nicotine
I got the molly, the Percocet, and methamphetamine
We kicked the Versace went to the Giuseppe store
Grab that shit straight off the mannequin
 
(Giuseppe me!)
You fuck niggas ain't in my weight class
I'm heavyweight, you niggas lightweight
When it comes up to this rap shit
You Sonny Liston and I'm Cassius Clay
"Paw! Paw! Paw!"
Hundred chickens on a Tonka toy
Beating the pot  like I'm Pretty Boy Floyd
Independent just like Macklemore
Hitting it hard like MacElroy
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Niggas ain't built like Offset
Sipping on Actavis like it was Moët
What you think you doing with your little bitty Rolex
Little bitty nigga but I'm built like Bow-flex
Wanna come back hit a nigga like jack
ATM bag that's a money book bag
Don't get it twisted, I get on yo' ass
Don't let the rap fool you, I've been sellin' bags
Run to the money got energy like I'm a generator
Maison Margiela my shoes is an alligator
When we got beef I'm the one who's the instigator
When I perform they say I look intimidated
I run off a ticket like I was a scientist
You rappers is fake, you an animation
And I'm a G but I'm not a Mason
I'm playing with money like recreation
[Hook]


[Hook: Quavo]
Need the whole thing when I'm buyin' 'em
Run and copped the whole bundle when I'm buyin' 'em
I'ma need a whole hundred when I'm buyin' 'em
I'ma need a whole truckload when I'm buyin' 'em
Shut down the whole city when I'm buyin' 'em
Make me feel like Obama when I'm buyin' 'em
Close the whole shop down when I'm buyin' 'em
Make you bring the blocks out when I'm buyin' 'em
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Bring a whole damn chicken, I want to buy it
Make 'em bring them whole blocks out and you bite 'em
Pockets on swole, I did it to the hundo breakin' that bowl
Got to buy 'em, when I buy 'em, get the bricks, I circumcise 'em
I got so many juugs on a nigga, I say [?]
Feelin' like the Koreans in 
Tellin' them niggas to hurry and buy 'em
Stop tryna walk up on me with them 
toolies [?]
 buy 'em
Next time he walk up in my trap
I'ma get a young nigga, go get a nigga, find him
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm eyein' it, I'm buyin' it
And if it ain't right I'm denyin' it
I'm 'bout the action, 'bout that violence
And no it ain't no rocket science
Get that pound and then you divide it
Weigh it up on the scale and count, slide it
Point 5 'em, I move in silence
I bought it, it wasn't an issue
Nigga I got 50 thousand dollars worth in tennis shoes
You gotta take an L if you want a fuckin' W
I started in a Super 8, I'm trappin' out the W
Mortal Kombat, fatality, I finish you
Niggas gonna hate on you, can you take the ridicule?
Got a hundred thousand dollars stashed up in the intertube
Got my bitches in the kitchen whippin' up a new
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Throwin' up cause my diamonds got me sick as fuck
Carlos in the pickup truck, hop out, 2 Glocks, the block is too hot
Make 'em give it up
Ever since I've been in the kitchen whippin'
Niggas wanna know my formula
Actavis sippin', nigga no prescription
I got the chickens, they're finger lickin'
I'm kickin' the game, I got more white than Barry
Benjamin is my itinerary
That nigga trappin' in December
I'll make a billion by the month of January
2Pac, Makiaveli, Hail Mary
No Nick Cannon, I'm trappin' Mariah Carey
My legacy livin' like Perry Ellis
I need 36, Jerome Bettis

When I first seen a [?], nigga got inspired
A nigga trap in the nighttime, no Michael Myers

 (I know you can't believe this shit.) Unbelievable. (We did it.) Nah, forreal
[Hook: Quavo]
Can't believe it, that we came out the north
Can't believe I turned my wrist to a fork
Can't believe it, we survived kickin' door
Can't believe it, made a milli off gold
Can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
Can't believe that my nigga's pistol missing
I can't believe we survived the sentence
Say you can't believe it, but I know you seen it
I can't believe that you don't want to witness
Can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it, can't believe it
Can't believe it, till you see it
Can't believe it, can't believe it
I can't believe it, no I can't believe it
[Verse 1: Quavo]
You say you didn't see but you can't believe it
When it come to kickin' doors I make you believe
We took off the block, cold, anemic
Touch down on the north and I really feed it
Mama, she told me go get it, get it
How can I not believe that she with it?
She came in my room, caught me breakin' a safe
Then she asked me, "Boy, Quavo what's really in it?"
Down in Miami, the 305
They tried to assassinate us like Biggie
What the hell goin' on?
No time to talk, bustin' back with extensions
Who got the iron?
I'm prayin' the Lord the bullet don't hit one of us in the spine
Open your eyes, stand up and bust with the fire
Stand up and bust with the fire
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I can't believe it, how I got these bitches

Wake up in the mornin', I say me a prayer like a preacher
I teach myself like a nigga had a teacher
I got Justin Bieber in my [?]
Picasso pretty pictures is Mona Lisa
I can take a trip to Argentina in amnesia
I don't need a fuckin' visa
I can't believe that we did what we did
But I pray to the man above, nigga we did it
Watch over my brother, I'm my brother's keeper
Dressed in black Margiela, I'm the Grim Reaper
Can you believe that we made a milli off of "Versace" money
Mentions ran off the meter
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Achievers, you niggas just disbelievers
Used to be in the bando with egg beaters
You seen the first chapter, now this the sequel
I'm ahead of you niggas, we not no equal
That's the same nigga that broke in them houses
He ain't have no checks so he sat and he counted
21, I had a Challenger
Monitor had 20 thousand, I couldn't even count
My life start changin', these bitches got frantic
These bitches, they see me, they start to panic
Grandma told me better take advantage
Your situation, don't take life for granted
Prayed to the Lord and my prayer got answered
I pulled to the club in a Phantom
'Member when the police bust in, it was random
Fuck it, we took the rap game, held it ransom
Give it up!

Yo, Quavo

Young nigga, I come to bless the economy

(Bow! Bow!)
I don't give a fuck feeling like Pac on my enemies
Your bitch she say that she loving a boss I tell her get lost (Adios)
We flex in 'sace, Versace, Givenchy, don't care what they cost (Givenchy?)

Now a nigga want to take a picture
Wanna flex with a nigga cause I'm worth 6 figures
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
You niggas done heard of me
Came from the poverty, family unity, Georgia community
Fucked up situation, underestimated
Now we in Bentley's and Rovers in Beverley
Look in the mirror, young rich nigga
Raised by my mama and my grandma nigga
No father figure, I'm a street nigga
Call me the god-father fuck nigga
I knew what it took to be bossed up, had a whole lot to offer
Sacrifice, I took some losses
Snakes in the grass be cautious
Rich forever, never going broke
I don't give a fuck if I got to go to selling dope
I got the bags, grocery store
Selling them O's, flipping them bowls
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Remember when I was a kid, mama told me eat my broccoli
(Eat that damn broccoli !)
Remember me I'm at the bus stop flexing my brand new pair of Barkley's
Different day, different year, different swag
I gave up the Barkley's for you wannabes
Cause you fuck niggas are under me
High-top or Low top, Giuseppe me
Charles Barkley, 34, I got the currency
Flowing like poetry
Cook it like poultry
Migos QC with the new OKC
My trap full of kids like an elementary
Selling that Hannah Montana and Kimberly
I trap but I keep it a mystery
Cause if they knew the Police'll be after me
[Hook]

He choppin' them bricks and remixin' them chickens
He front me the work, now I got a ticket

Finessing the plug, again I did it
,

My life is expensive
,

Erasing the work, like a #2 pencil
Hoes with me, on the left and the right
I'm feeling like Malcolm, I'm stuck in the middle
You a rat in the hood, Stuart Little
I'm blowing on gas like a fiddle
Young nigga in the hood selling nickels
, 
white boys keep the ice Popsicles
Flip the work, like a acrobat, doing jumping jacks
J's sniff the work off the plate, had a heart attack
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Whippin' the coca, no cola
You want it, just hit me on my Motorola
My diamonds are yellow corona

I laugh at you clowns, Ronald Mcdonald,

Plug out in China Town, hit my cell and said he got that shrimp fried rice
He drop the prices by the pound in China Town


[Hook]
Its a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
Its a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin money in the club when you know your pockets hurting
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Its a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens,
 
I'm leaning, I feel like I’m fallin'
But really I’m trippin
Only wear Ballys when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin that Brittney, that Whitney, That Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist
, 
treat em like dentist
You showing your benjis on instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
Ima get it back cause a nigga got a sack,
 
so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin back, Im aimin the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip,
 
and a brand new 45 sittin in my lap
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Quavo]
Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, 
we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin, they slavin
I ride 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it!"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
Im servin them patients,
 
my money is ancient
My diamonds are lookin like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin to Cali, I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
, 
my house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker
, 
molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker
[Hook]


[Intro]

[Verse 1: Quavo]
Dope boy, dope boy, dope boy
When a nigga growed up wanna be a dope boy
Mom bust in, caught me counting money
"Say you better not be dealing that coke boy"
Got caught up in breaking in houses
First time a young nigga seen 1000
Then I went and copped my Audi
Then I had a meeting with a plug 
on a mountain
The plug start frowning
Cause I needed 1000 ounces
Why you needed 1000 ounces
Cause my young nigga finna go snatch 'em
Plug, I attack em
Calling the plug for ransom
Rich nigga pull up in Phantoms
Trapping the nicks, flipping them nicks
Young nigga I’m walking with cannons
My bitch got the dope in her panties
You too dramatic
All of my niggas go money savage
Bricks in the Hummer, it’s automatic
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Contraband contraband contraband
Take down one hundred birds, I'm a country man
The plug is talking Español, I understand
Throwing a brick like Randall Cunningham
J's they love me cause I got good customer service
I live in the trap so sometimes I be nervous
Get rich or die trying like Curtis
The trap concession stand, get you a slurpy
You obviously never been in a trap (never ever)
We shortage you, you ain’t get money back
Beating the pot Mortal Kombat, Jax
Brick big as hell, hit it with the axe
The gas is reeking and you need some Axe
The stove don't work just use a match
I’m fucking your bitch, she a natnat
Two door Panamera, got a hatchback
Customer customer I am a hustler
I got candy Reese's Buttercup
Offset is worth 2 million plus
Touch down the plug, then drop a rope
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Contraband contraband contraband (narcotic narcotic narcotic)
Contraband contraband contraband (narcotic) contraband
Smoking OG's from Afghanistan
I got the candy, they call me the Candy-Man
Bands can’t fit in a rubber band
No football, I'm walking with thigh pads
Baking soda with the water
Stove on, throw the dope in a frying pan
Pick up the spatula, I’m the ambassador
Audi R8 creepin', like a tarantula
Making moves, spectacular
Beating the dope with the stick and it's magical
I set the block off and it's epical
Bank of America, walking register
Can’t fuck wit you niggas, too skeptical
Undercover, you work with the federals
OG gas bags and it's medical
Work in my bando
Got cookies they edible
Stretching the work it's incredible
Pull up on the plug so I can go pick up some
[Hook]
[Outro]


[Hook]
Everywhere I go, I'mma put on a show, you know I gotta turn up
I just left the plug, got a 100 birds and I put them in the trunk
Yeah I got halves, got zips, got cuties, got pounds, nigga tell me what you want
In the kitchen with a pyrex pot, turn it up a notch
Now I'm bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
Got them chickens and them pigeons, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, got them Falcons and them Ravens, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
Catch me whipping up them babies, bout to cook it up
Bout to cook it up, bout to cook it up
And I'm whipping like it's slavery, bout to cook it up
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I whip it like slavery
, 
my trap full of babies
Lil mama she hate me, she say that I'm changing
I tell her I made it, the only thing changing the money I'm making
And the pamper on these babies
I'm whipping and whipping, these pigeons and chickens
These birds they flying from city to city
I'm pouring up Actavis, dranking and sipping
The color is purple, I'm drinking on Ceely
The Bentley
, 
the Benjis

these bitches they sucking like babies
On the nip of them titties,

You talking bout 100 band juugs, young nigga you know that I'm with it

I'm serving ODs, I got it from Mickey
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Quavo]
I'm cooking and whipping up pies, with no eyes
I'm cooking them burgers and fries, I'm a master in disguise
Mama she told me I'm wise, looking at Benjamin Frank in his eyes
I'm taking the plug to Hawaii,
 
I'm chopping on bricks circumcised
My bitch, she came from Dubai,
 
she got that good brain like Devry
I'm smoking and leaning and driving, I hope I don't get DUI
Watch out for the snake and the lies, I'm trapping and whipping cream pies
My wrists is like water come dive
, 
the streets is a jungle you gotta survive
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
You rappers you wanna be thirty three still tryna copy me (Old ass rappers!)
Young rich nigga only 19 and you'd better acknowledge me (I'm only 19!)
Fuck nigga you spitting and rapping like this without Migos consent want apology
The labels keep talking, the critics keep writing and
All because we gettin' currency
I think it’s time for extortion
Or killing you babies, abortion (Kidnap you niggas my Migos will torture you)
I told you I'd rather be rich than famous
Fuck nigga dissin' my label
These fuck niggas done stole so much goddamn swag, might as well sell it
The critics done said it, I might as well tell it
On Actavis
 
with my shirt off screaming fuck the world like Makaveli
QC the label! Solid Foundation!
Young nigga on the block with the work to the sun come up
Trapping like a fundraiser
Fuck nigga you know I'm a Migo
If I dont have Emmit, get poked with a razor
[Hook]
Which one of my cars should I drive today? (They all foreign)
I don't know
Which one of my hoes should I fuck today? (They all bad)
I don't know
Which one of my chains should I put on? Put 'em all on
You niggas you know, you niggas you know that you stealin' my flow
Whatever you with, we with it x3
Whatever you with, whatever you with, my nigga we pressing, my nigga we pressing the button
My niggas ain't stressed they got money, whatever you with, whatever you with, you know that my niggas we with it
[Verse 2: Quavo]
They copy the name, they copy the gang, they copy the slang (they copy my name)
Versace, Versace we 
brought
 that shit back and you niggas is lame
We hearin' the way that these rappers is rappin' that shit not creative
What's the difference?
We some young niggas that signed to no label
My squad is so deep in the club, your fans and your people don't notice you
All of my niggas got diamonds, they flashin' they look like a photoshoot
I pull up in valet, the Audi got soft top but my top is bulletproof
And now they want jugg and finessin'
Now they want 'sace the necklace
At first we didn't expect it and now we expect it
At first the flow they neglect it and now they respect it
I'm thanking God for the blessing,
 (to not have a rat in my session)
I know that this game is dirty Smith & Wesson
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
You must got the rabies, you bitin'
You copy my swag and I like it
Young nigga I'm for sale
Give em' hell!
Put a nigga on a mission, young nigga won't fail
Ya'll pussy ass rappers, these niggas they wise
Never trap, never cap, never been in a trial
You with it, I'm with it, them hollows start spitting
These niggas they shaking like Diddy
Gotta pay to trap on my block, extortion
80 percent of your guap
No lie, 
Versace, it got me a fortune
Enormous money ain't never gone stop
Woke up this morning and I played the radio
Nigga's remedial, sounding like Radio
Them niggas not talking just pullin yall cards
Dunk a nigga, Vince Carter
Bullets have a nigga dancing like Carlton
[Hook]


[Verse 1: Takeoff]
Young rich nigga, riding round the city with the mac
Take a chopper, and a chicken, now watch he's leaking
Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget, nah for real
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about?
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken in up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up, and bust it down
Migo, Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
J-1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot Boy, so you know I gotta stay low
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet
Set! Told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check
I'm a young nigga, with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it,
 
I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke swishers, like a regular nigga
Now I'm a backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he run up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a Beatle
Now people they screaming out "Free Activis"
They talking bout that Activis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, trapper, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental
Trap, trap dab when I'm on the revenue
Cooking a brick, and remix it with the dog food
Diamond brick come with a note on it, nigga you Blues Clues
24 karat my chain, Mr. T pity the fool
Master P, no limit,
 money been all jumping like a bungee
Kevin Hart, your money is too short, you too funny
Call me Takeoff Hugh Hefner, I got playboy bunnies
Fuck it, I beat it, she sucking me till a nigga be cumming
[Hook: Quavo]
Cross the country, cross the country
You may never been there catch me
Cross the country, cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves, and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English, but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a visa, cause I'm in and out the country
[Verse 2: Offset]
When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in the game
Taking pictures of a nigga, like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My nigga be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol Pete, for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at popeyes
The streets is a jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the 4 4, make him fold
Chattahoochee river, where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the Folks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank, take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella, like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip, like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger, turn into the Terminator
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Quavo]
Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap, like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: That's my motherfucking testimony
Out in the desert, got bricks in the donkey
Rich nigga, with a pot of gold, like a leprechaun
And I'm thinking 'bout moving to Babylon
My niggas collecting extortion funds
We built an empire, like Megatron
QC the label, Migo the gang
Already told you, I want the M&Ms, fuck the fame
No shame in the game, I'm a bull with the nine
Like Luol Deng, finna bang with the thing
Walking through the crowd, ain't gotta tuck the chain
Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200, just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100, so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad, at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again
[Hook: Quavo]


[Intro]

Just look at that, Forest, look at that, Forest, run!
Got pink in my cup, it's not lookin' like just a Bubble Gum
I'm asking the bitch "what's her name?" she telling me Cinnamon
I want to put all my glaze on you like a Cinnabon
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Lil' mama be looking so gorgeous
She ask me can I afford it
I told her bitch she got me fucked up
My Migos chain can pay her mortgage

Pockets enormous calling me Norbit
Take it from Migos I'm making Tostitos, illegal, I might get deported
You niggas be trippin, you fucked up
If you thinkin' you gon' catch me slipping
(KLA! KLA! KLA!)
Leaving no witness, Grinch comin' through your chimney
I got the Bobby, the Britney, the Iggy
Sorry I ran out of Whitney
Yeah nigga, I'm making history
Before I die, you gon' remember me
[Bridge] + [Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
She grindin' her teeth
 
like she hungry
Poppin' the molly, she horny
She talkin' too much, she annoying
She giving out blowjobs, no employment
My diamonds anemic
, 
she sneaking and geeking
She said she got a nigga, tell him she cheatin'
It's been a whole weekend, so when are you leaving?
Just suck on the dick baby girl, don't be teasing
My neck is so sick, somebody come and treat it
Migos in the building and we sold out arenas
Come get yo bitch 'out the system my nigga
She smokin' up all of the reefer
Leave my 2 liter, don't do margaritas
This shit that we're smokin' is louder than speakers
[Hook]
[Outro]


[Hook: Quavo]

Young rich nigga keep a dirty ass stick
Finesse you out the pair with your [?], thats a dirty bitch
Cooking up the pie with that dirty ass stick
Pow, pow, pow, gggraow with the dirty stick
Whats that in your cup? Man that's that dirty shit. (Lean!)
All my goons go crazy they be on that dirty shit
Ridin' round the city in a dirt ass Benz
Had to cut some niggas off, I had some dirty ass friends
32 dirty birds and they white, look like Michael Jackson
Try me with the fuck shit, then my animals attack 'em
Uncle Sam, had to tax 'em
Warren Sapp, quarterback sack 'em
Good gas, good cookie, sip the Green Bay I pack 'em
[Hook]
I'm mobbin', I'm working the pot with them dirty sticks
Got bino all up in the pot, whipping up 36
Like Grady and Fred G. Sanford I don't fuck with no dirty bitch
I lick on the molly and hit that bitch with that metal stick
Longway Hefner on a nigga they calling the boy your majesty
Them dirty sticks, them dirty sticks, young nigga come blast a bitch
You cuffing your bitch, I'm cuffing your bitch
We switch and we smash that shit
You talking bout racks, they stuffed in my MCM bag
They next to my dirty stick
Don't fuck with no rat, no snitch, get found in a ditch
Get hot with that dirty stick
We call for them birds, young nigga with dirty sticks
They same what to happen Bird and shit
Got hit with them dirty, dirty sticks and they were finessed by a bitch
Slim Dunkin on layup and shit, 3 amigos along with his shit
Took [?] to serve up a brick, instead of shopping we [?]
[Hook]
I be playing with them dirty birds like my name Jamaal
Pull up, hop out, I valet the Jag and Kamals'
Actavis that is my medicine
No internet but I'm connected to that white girl, Kevin Federline
Takeoff the vegetarian
I gotta have my lettuce and celery
I'm taking them trips to Beverly
I'm strapped with dirty artillery
The bando it got a dispensary
Lil mama she diggin' she feeling me
She told me she want to run round the lobby
I gave her a molly and left the club in the Ferrari
I'm pouring that dirty, that 40

Don't tell 'em that I beat it up like fight night
But she did tell me that you're small like a Mike & Ike
Too much information,

But everybody know that she selfish
Pull up in Ferraris, my bitch rockin' Versace
They already know we fuckin', you ain't gotta hide it
Nobody can find us, we coolin' on islands
You ain't gotta tell him that I got you outta Follies
When I pulled up on her, you know she get in
She ain't know that I'm handsome and wealthy
House on a hill, got a mansion, come live
Just don't tell nobody how you got in
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Beat it up, don't eat it up, Bentley Mulsanne I speed it up
Want you to travel around the globe with me, no Expedia
Rockin' a mink chinchilla, fox fur, put in my interior
Smokin' hookah with Everclear, takin' a trip to Delaware
Maison Margiela, I shop any weather
My girl wanna be a Giuseppe stepper
Peter Piper, he done piped the pepper
I'm Michael Phelps, won a gold medal
Hit it with the left then hit it with the right
Knockout just call me Mayweather
So many Benjamins on me
Might mistake me for a bank teller
[Hook: Jeremih]
[Verse 4: Offset]
I'm dabbin' in Maison Margielas, don't tell 'em they might get jealous
Her forehead on my pelvis, I don't cuff 'em, I don't settle
You a champion, you deserve a gold medal
Ain't got time on my schedule, gotta go get the cheddar
You ain't got time to be worried 'bout them
Kissin' all over you, rubbin' your hip
I got the Tiffany diamonds all up in your ear
Smackin' your booty while I'm hittin' it from the rear
Smackin' a secret, your pussy be drippin' in liquid
I did a show I cannot leave it, fuck her and then I delete it
Victoria, she keepin' a secret, don't tell 'em that, no
My diamonds, they cold, anemic, and I can't front, no
I'm finished, you know I need a

Feeling like Slick the Ruler
Versace my shirt I love Medusa
Can't get in contact with my plug
So I'm taking a flight to Bermuda

Whipping and whipping the brick my arm gets sore
Drop a hundred bands off to my momma nigga
Just to make sure everything kosher
Hit a nigga ass with the Ropa Dope
Cause I see these niggas getting tired
You run out of bullets my nigga gon' get you BOW GRAHH nigga it's a homicide
Gone!
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I put the dope in my sock, I put the dope on the block, I'm fucking your ho

Breaking these pigeons off chickens, serving the junk's chicken tenders
Finessed the plug for a bag of work and I'm glad I didn't ate 'fo dinner
I know some lions some bears some tigers hyenas and even gorillas
My jeweler he call it can cooler it'll buy me shivers
My boss credentials got these bitches callin' me king in front of their mister

She pull up when I'm in her area

She got a white dress looking like marriage, bro
Ain't gon' lie, she rough, she tough, she might hit you in your stuff
Finesse you out of yo bucks and bring it to us, I fuck with the trust
At the end of the day, she psycho

Ho, you too dramatic

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
What the fuck? Goddamn

Don't want you, bitch, I want yo friend
Excuse me, you wanna do what?
Lil mama rolling on Molly santan
I turn round look over my shoulder
Lil mama got the camera phone flashing
She went up and asked for a selfie
I told her she too dramatic

Drop in Orlando, I'm selling that magic
She calling my phone, harassing
Ho, you too dramatic
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
These bitches be tripping, I'm tryna get Benjamins
Talking my head off, she all in her feelings
Asked me for money, but never ain't giving
Wasn't fucking with me before I had a million
I'm chasing them dollars, I don't want no problems
You fucking me and you be fucking my partner
I know what to do, keep the bitch off my collar
Don't fuck her no more, then I cut off the guala
These bitches not loyal, don't trust 'em
Don't cuff 'em, don't love 'em, just fuck 'em
She telling me that she gon' ride, but deep inside I know that she lying
I know she ain't shit, she a dirty ass bitch
She gon' fuck yo whole clique, she gon' run off with bricks
Young, rich nigga, I ain't worried 'bout shit
Dramatic ass ho, you can suck my dick
Ho, you too dramatic

Hell yea I said Dr.Dolittle

Me and my dogs in the trap
We came up off of nickels
[Verse 1:Quavo]
First time I kick that door I ain't even know
What I was getting myself into but I came out with gold
Seventeen years old cash out on a jugg
Hit a True Religion Store
Eighteen years old me and RelMoney hit the plug for a boat
My momma mad cause the house reeking
Bagging up grams late night im sleeping
It took her re-up money just to make this rap shit easy
And a whole lot of praying
Gotta lay you down the blueprint
I'm standing here with my dogs
Nigga I know M&M's gone stand
[Hook]
[Verse 2:Offset]
Fish scale fish scale

Never passed gym class, but I'm good with moving weight
If I front a nigga duece

Offset is a boss trap nigga hash tag
Coca coca coca crack
Hit like 
Sammy Sosa
From clapping like Magnolia
Tryna sew ya' I don't know ya'
I came up and you fell off

My niggas trapping on and off
They get the work and get it off

My wrist game real sick so I need soup by Mrs Campbells

Young nigga running with the work, 
Trapping in bandos and shelters
Young Takeoff and I'm finna buy Delta
Pourin' that 2 plus 2 in my Fanta
Your pockets look like they got cancer
I just bought a brand new Mercedes from Haiti and set it on some Walter Paytons
My 'migo he asked me to front him a kilo, I threw it to him like I was Peyton

Go to the moon like astrologist
We not acceptin' apologies
Sellin' the dope to economies
Young rich nigga ridin' 'round in the Bentley
Throwin' money out the ceiling momma told me I'm ignant!
I'm two steps ahead of ya, never been regular
Hit a nigga with the antidope and we burry him
Hop in the Jag', I'm droppin' the top back
Smoking on gas like a nigga got cataracts
Duck ass nigga I'm calling you Aflac

Only one bird can bring the whole corner back
Like Offset been throwin' like a quarterback

The Nino Brown, and he got arrested
I'm laughing at niggas, Chris Rock

[Hook: Takeoff] (x2)
They say you made a milli off Versace, that's a fact
They say before this rap shit you been had it
They said that young rich nigga went with global on the net
You niggas sound just like amigo, that's my lingo, that's a fact
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
You say that there's a new flow in the game then that's a fact
Niggas be like Takeoff you done blew up like I might be fat
Ain't no vacation in this rap 'til I see twenty platinum plaques
On the block like I might be Shaq
Bought a spauldings just check my stats
Walk in Saks with a sack
I'm fuckin' up the economy like Eddie Crack
Made a mil off Versace, independent, how you do that
Caught investing in yourself with M&Ms, nigga
Made a milli but don't think we don't got M&Ms
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
You niggas be talkin', you niggas be rappin'
That shit that you sayin' is not no fact
Back in the day I used to juug flats
My family proud of me no Kyla Pratt
Stomp a nigga out like I'm in a frat
You natnats bother me like a gnat
Hood bitch different color her tracks
Cookin' up chickens the babies just hatched
Fell in love with the lean I'm attached
I'm fresh and I'm dabbin', not talkin' bout wax
Fat blunts like a Louisville bat
I need all my money not takin' no slack
When you talk to a boss take off your hat
Break in these houses, free my nigga Mac
Bitches go both ways like Da Brat
You say not smokin' I make you relapse
[Hook]


[Intro: Takeoff]
Yeah, you can see my diamonds nigga

FakeWatchBusta can't bust me [x8]
[Verse 1: Takeoff]
I just bought a Rollie presidential and it hurricane Katrina flooded
FakeWatchBusta can’t bust me

Broke niggas commenting on my picture "@FakeWatchBusta"
Pull up on a nigga with the chopper, think he seen the Ghostbusters
I got the diamond detector so niggas can't say that my diamonds fugazi
VS1s in my Cuban necklace,
  
in the VIP section drinking Texas
Bitch I got Africa sittin' on my pinky
Traffickers see it, they calling me Benny
Breitling Bentley made by Bentley Motors
Bentley Mulsanne I leased it , it's not rented
Red dot for your head, green dot for my niggas in the penitentiary
Looking real hard, don't know what they saw
This a Audemars Piguet
Fuck it, I’m thinking about throwing baguettes in my chandelier ceiling
And I'mma scrape the game for every coin cause a nigga came from a fuckin penny
Check out my watch it's authentic
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Quavo]
Thirty thousand for a Rollie
To you, I spent a lot of guacamole
Take a look in my jewelry box, it's open
I got the cash, they say you got tokens
Where the receipt at?
Tell your watch is stolen
Now everybody say they got a Rollie
Remember one year ago rocking my Quartz
Now I shut the duffle bag in the stores
Cash out on a Audemar
 shining just like the stars
My jewelry box came with some 
burglary
 bars
My diamond dancing singing every bar
I treated my diamonds like beauty bars
My diamonds different colors, living colors
They be jumping around like a rock star
No Jackson 5 but it's 3 of us brothers
We keep the Nina now we pop stars
While you sitting there watch me on instagram
You can count the rings on my fucking hand
Only eight fingers a hundred bands
Seventy racks for my Migo man
Thirty K for Quavo Rolex
She want it so bad that's a price check
Came from trapping and now I do mic check
I will take your life dare you to touch my neck
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
My watch is authentic you niggas' watches they be rented
You need to throw it in a blender
When I seen a nigga watch, I got offended
WatchBusta the judge and you got convicted
You and your partners is codefendant
Evidence telling your watch is fiction
You went to the Jeweler he bust your medulla
For something that wasn't even official
FakeWatchBusta can't bust me
I am no busta my diamonds yellow look like mustard
You need some 
WD-40, your diamonds is rusty
I come through 
these bitches look like bustas
You rappers be lying, You talking bout VVS
When your pockets looking like you anorexic
My diamonds, my diamonds been tested
I might go to Africa — diamond selection
I'm getting my big diamonds straight out the Tiffany
My time is telling the bodily energy
Official tissue from Rolex company
Fake watch that's not rich to me
It's not official you're not tricking me
Thirty K nigga ain't shit to me
If you think my watch fake you can get a key
I got the golden ticket Chuck E. Cheese

Rose Rolex, eating pork rinds
Aquaberry diamonds froze the hands of time
Codeine pouring with the purple swans
I’m playing hackey sack in the valet parking at Hakkasan
Neon swim shorts, I don’t play sports
The way I ball, I burn through money like a Newport
Mentos seats, and the paint orange
Should I sip codeine, or should I sing a chorus?
I got an all star team, but I’m running late
I got talk show dreams, like I’m Ricky Lake
Yeah you can’t tell me nothing, you can tell I’m stunting
Who woulda knew I’d have Versace jewels across my tooth


[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I like the way she wear it, uh, baby, wiggling

BrickSquad 1017 that's the money team
Band jump like trampoline in my Billy Jeans
Ride around smoking on stank
Switch your hair around like you’re Rodman
Your hair matching my drink
, I’mma need you on the whole paint
It’s like going on a date with a different woman every time I step out
Your hair stand out, my money go up
She change her hair so many colors, it’s like I'm living living color
Her pussy wet just like the water
I bought a pound, we smoked a quarter
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
She changed her hair again just like dennis rodman

Bally kicks on like I'm playing FIFA
With the Migos 30 for a feature
Purple lean it's 200 for a liter
Talking about I'm sipping lean by the liter
Y'all niggas still sipping margaritas
Y'all niggas don't know what a bando mean
Y'all niggas saying "boys on the windows"
Keep the wood in my hand, got a splinter
Got the white and tan bricks in the fender
Hurricane wrist spinning like a motor
IPhone been a trap phone, Motorola

My whipgame it is so anxious
We cookin' the dope like it's baking

It is amazing

It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Sirloin steak all on my dinner plate
Your main bitch say she wanna make a sex tape
Rich nigga, I could never be a broke nigga (rich nigga)
Broke niggas I can never get along with them!
Always been hated since a little nigga (always)
It's forever pussy nigga gotta deal with it (rich nigga!)
[Hook]
[Verse: Quavo]
Float like a butterly, sting like a bee
Rumble young nigga rumble!
Lil' mama want a nigga like me in the sheets
Ice Cube knock it out like Deebo
Now who's that talking that gangsta shit?
Somebody gonna kick your ass
When I walk up in the club I better make a thunderstorm
Let them know that this a whole lot of cash
Rich niggas on the right all night (rich nigga)
Broke niggas to the left by yourself (brokanese)
Now who the hell just said that the roof on fire?
Call 911 like Wyclef
[Hook]
[Verse: Offset]
I'm a rich nigga, I don't like a bitch nigga
Nigga broke nigga, I don't deal with you
All of my niggas, official

my bitches they strippers
My niggas they criminals trying to get to the M&Ms
If your bitch is so innocent, why she sucking my children
Last time I asked I dine and dashed and bitch I go in the building
Bad bitch make it clap, like Magnolia
Young rich nigga on the couch talking to Oprah
Bottles in the VIP while I stand on the sofa
I don't speak your language, Brokanese, I thought I told ya
These bitches they be smokin' on hookah
, 
my nigga ballin' like Hoosiers
Geeked up in the Double R, I scare ya bitch, Freddy Krueger
Flooded Franck Muller

[Intro:]
If you know me know this ain't my feng shui
Certified everywhere, ain't gotta print my resume

Public Service Announcement

MIGO!
[Hook: Takeoff]
Broke niggas stand to the left
My rich niggas stand to the right

Hit it with the left, hit with the right
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night
Beat it with the left, beat it with the right
Im'a knock the pussy out like fight night
[Verse 1: Tyga]
Pack the pussy out, 
Pacquiao
Put a pussy in his place, throw it like a paper route
Pussy on a stand, my bitch'll never testify
We ain't never vibe, like the 
mag
 it's all blurred lines
Who the fuck wanted pussy? Punch you in your good eye
Go the all time, role with me then it's genocide
Poor bitches down to ride, big booty, tender lines
All whip, they never lies (?)
I pastor, I'm the reverend now
Young Jones, Spike Lee with this king shit
Tap the face, Mike Tyson, real Tyga in the crib
Shit, sitting on sixes, I started this king shit
This the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
 Bitch

Pocket rocket fire, watch him disintegrate
It's a truckload coming on the interstate
Sirloin steak all on my dinner plate

Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life, (my life, my life)
This is my life
Finesser, finesser
Finesser, finesser
This is my life
This is my life (finesse, finesse, finesse)
[Verse 1: 
Quavo
]
Finessed the plug by the check, I hop on a jet, I go to Quebec
When I went to the jeweler didn't know what I wanted
And I told him as long as my diamonds are wet
I am a blessing and you are a curse
I only finesse the plug with words
Placed the order, I ordered the birds
She put 'em in a car then a young nigga skurrt
Teen bands in the suitcase no flex
Young nigga in the hood, walking round sellin nicks
Ever since a young nigga, balling like a Net
And I got a Asian plug, no Jeremy Lin
Let the top back, let your hair blow in the wind
Finesse the plug, I don’t need a Benjamin
Judge out of trial so you know I'm innocent
Smoking on gas blunts longer than incense
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Juug, Finesse, Steal
I gotta have a mil
I was raised on the hill like 
Jack and the Jill
Do anything just to pay them bills
My brother caught 15 waiting for the pill
When a nigga broke, he coming at your throat
Tryna' sell the coke but it really is soap
My lil' nigga Shad got smoked
Hungry for the money, trying to get the dough
Shit get real, nigga tried to kill
All this bullshit for a dollar bill
Hoes set you up, they don’t give a fuck
Tryna' get ya bucks, watch who you fuck
Plug’s like a socket, 
gotta keep the rocket
Tryna get a profit,
 
running to that money like Sonic
All my cars robotic
No Master P, but "I'm Bout It" gone
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Finessing and flexing like Wrestlers
Indian plug in that castle
Bald headed Jag, got cancer
Turn your main bitch to a dirty dancer
I’m cooking and wrapping them chickens
Finessing these niggas on tickets
If I fuck with ya, I’mma give you a straight drop
If its anotha' nigga I gotta remix it
Flipping them patties like Krabby's
My shoes is Prada's or Bally's
Finessing since I can remember
My wrist so cold, December
I’m selling T-bones, they tender
That steel wrapped around me like Bender
Difference between me and you
I'm real and you a pretender
[Hook]


[Intro: Quavo]
I swear I watch first forty-eight all the time
Wonder if I'm gone be on there (Nah!)
[Hook: Quavo]
First 48!!! Get my migo on the phone
Yeah my migo one call away, he'll pull a first 48!!!
I ain't playing with these niggas
Pull the chopper start spraying on these niggas, pull a first 48!!!
Young niggas dying every night
Young niggas mama crying every night
What that show call Rel? First 48!!!
I swear to god I don't want to do it
But I might have to do it, bout to do a first 48!!!
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Niggas tried to hit me for my my chain (No way)
Can't let you do it lil nigga
Cause I'm about to pull a (first 48!!!)
Now they asking me where is the pistol
If they find the pistol I'ma get a life sentence
Take me to population
 
officer I'm dressing out
They had no evidence in the first forty-eight they let me out
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
What the fuck? Who that is outside?
Pulled in my driveway, it's really late)
They parked in, man I cannot see the tag
But I see a badge, 12, time to shake
Fuck, I rush out my backdoor
Trying to grab all of my cash flow
Jumping these fences don't know where to go
If I get caught, I get down on my knees and repent
But what's a case if they ain't got no evidence
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
I am no killer but nigga you pushed me
Pussy nigga thought a nigga was rookie, hit me for the cookies
It's okay, I'ma catch a nigga in the alley way(Catch his ass)
Hundred round under the K
Nigga feel my pain
I just caught a case
The police saying they knowing my name
They knowing the fame, and the chains
It's part of the game
You run in my trap,
 
the chopper going to hit you harder than a train
The witness is who you going to blame
No Damon Wayans, I'm bringing the Major Payne
[Hook]


[Hook x2]
Versace Versace Versace
2Pac and Christopher Wallace
Camera flashing, paparazzi
Twenty bitches in the lobby
I just came home from the slammer
Plus sendin' work on bananas
Migo the gang no bandana
Lindsay Lohan and Amanda
[Verse 1]
Feelin' like Tony Montana, the world is mine,I ain't lyin'
I got babies and pies
No dimes
Three days ago young nigga was sitting doing time
Sick to my stomach, got on my grind
And bought Lambo with no minds
Kickin 'em doors, sellin' them bows , whippin' them O's
Now everything gold
Bentleys and Ross, ain't sellin my soul
My niggas depend on me, M-I-G-O
God is my witness, he know I was gettin' it
Ask for forgiveness for sins I've commited
This ain't no rap, cause a nigga done did it
Don't believe me? Nigga go ask the critics
[Hook]


[Intro : Quavo]
Flexin' on these hoes, designer all my clothes
Walk around with them O's, flexin' on these hoes
[Hook x4 : Quavo]
Flexin' on these hoes, money all in my note
Designer all my clothes,
 
walk around with them O's
[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Flexin' on these hoes, diamonds on my neck
Pull off in that Lambo, that paint drippin' it wet
Pull off with your hoes, I feel like Keith Sweat
I'm walkin' 'round with these O, meet my plug on the jet
I just call my goons and they walk around with that Tec
I call up my jeweler, drop these bands on my wrist
I pull off with that loud, let see if it could draw
You walk around with that set then my niggas they gon' rob
I put Louis on my shoes, designer on my belt
I can't help myself, got bands all in that shelf
Need to go to rehab, money it too long
I call my plug, he in Hong-Kong
[Hook]
[Verse 2 : Offset]
All these damn cameras, model they gon' pose
Pull up in a Rolls, I take your ho
I heard you cuffin' hoes, boy that's a lil old
I ain't stand no bitch, walk around with them zips
[?] when I gave this ass a remix
You say that's your girl but she smashed the whole damn clique
We pulled up in them Bentley thang and they can't stand this shit
VVS in on gliss, I take your bitch
My bitch from Québec, her dad he my connect
I ride up in Gucci these hoes can't refuse me
Made movies, no actor, no director, just goonies
You, beyond the peanut but you so "punny"
[Hook]
[Verse 3 : Takeoff]
I got a bag full of them O, I ain't talking 'bout Cheerio
E-Every where a young nigga go
You gon' see a hundred goons screamin' out "Migo"
Got a Panamera coupe 2 door
And a true Benz scale full of dough
Hit a drought, cash out on a boat
Roll out the old school and free Bo
It should be illegal when flexin' these hoes
Twenty yayo, from Puerto Rico
Dominicano got the dope on a "No"
Whippin' the pot til her arm get swolled
Drugs he roll, diamonds are froze
Illuminati takin' bitches, oh
Bustin' the block with the rest of these O's
Gotta get money, the jet high it go
[Hook]


FLY WITH A FISH

Sellin' that gas to my rasta

Flashin' my diamonds is dancin'
Takin' it straight with the gadget
Pull in my mansion
Hop out I pulled up

(Chorus)

I knew she was digging my pimping
And new Christian Louboutin's forgot to mention. (Red bottoms!)
I brought that bitch in my facility
Told her, "My favorite room in here's the kitchen, (In the kitchen)
After I whip all these chickens

She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping
 (Huh?)
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double
Told that bitch, "Pour your own muddy trouble"
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, (What?)
Shawty broke down and start telling her business
I said to lil' mama, "You tripping
I don't give a fuck what you did,
 
cause business is business.
" (Business is business!)
So now we sitting in my condo, (Top floor!)
I don't even know what to say no more
She's telling me, telling me she don't wanna be a freak no more, but...

Selling that dope call me Rico
Then get enough, flip the whole kilo
[Hook]


[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Pull up and wet up the city don't care about no feelings

You're bittersweet like a lemon
Hey I'ma move you up to Beverly but not the Center
Hey Young Thug gon' bite that fish just like its tenders
The way I'm geek'd up don't know one of my members
Hannah Montana

She got her a lawyer not goin' to the slammer
Plus she did trial in a Phantom (Rich bitch!)
Imma pull up leave it running

Don't play I snuck the gun in
My bitch think she dreaming cause I grabbed the Tommy
She thought that I grabbed on my stomach

Cook so much dope it startin to look just like comic
It could make a young kid vomit
Catch a dumb ho, hook her up to phonics
I'm slick and ironic
[Verse 2: Quavo]
I'm taking your bitch out to Beverly Hills
And I didn't give her nothing but a molly pill
I'm the Fresh Prince and I live on a mansion, young nigga my daddy not Phil
Me and Young Thugga we drank muddy trouble
My pockets inflating like I blew a bubble
When the mixtape dropping Migo?
Young nigga just wait on it! You acting like undercover

And it's getting thick on me like peanut butter
 ("Baw, glaw !")
Short with the gwalla, I'm coming at you like the headhunter

Pull up on you and your people

Got your bitch in the condo I'm all in her ovary
'Sace my chest out like I am with Jodeci
I'm a wizard with bricks, Harry Potter, do sorcery
I'm at the top and no nigga is over me
Run in yo' house like I'm Jeeper Creeper
Pour a 4 in the 2 liter
Christian Louboutin, walking on hyena
Straight out the trenches I use an egg-beater I whip up a beamer
Beat it like Tina
,

I beat the pot my knuckle got a damn fracture
Add up the digits my nigga money on top of money, fractions
My niggas they all about action, no camera
Pull out the choppa, it hit yo' ass hard like the judge, with the hammer
You niggas is monkey
That's why the choppa got a Hundred-round hanging, banana
These bitches be asking me questions like
'Offset why the hell you walking on mammals?'

Hey, Mama gotta mansion now she perfect
Spared my last mill but it turned out to be worth it
She just wanna do it for the Vine

If you ain't got no rollie she do not waste her time
I don't want your weed boy you're smoking on pines, nigga

[Hook]
[Verse 2 – Offset]
Fuck em, fuck em, fuck em
We don’t love em, love em, love em
I’m a hustler, hustler, hustler
Rolex diamond flooded, flooded
Police they watching, investigation undercover
I would never tell on my brother, I put it on my mother
Pull out the chopper, the chopper eat him like he mustard
Look at me now nigga, money grew up, Rudy Huxtable
Mason Margiella, 
we mafia like Goodfellas
I got 20 bitches on my schedule, I’m living better
When you go to a Migos show it’s looking like Coachella
When the police ask me questions, acting like I don’t know better
Fuck a nigga, we don’t give a fuck about a sucker nigga
I got a milly, bought a billy, hundred rounds up in my semi
Hit the fuck nigga with a chopper, do you feel me now?
You a bitch nigga, pussy nigga, you need a fucking blouse
Fake goon, cartoon, you a mickey mouse
I got your bitch in my condo, I’m bout to fuck her now
Take a ride with a G, nigga buckle down
QC fuck nigga

[Hook]
[Verse 3 – Quavo]
Fuck em, fuck em, nigga get out my section
Don’t want to see him, I don’t want to touch him
Look at my diamonds, my jeweler from Russia
Walk in the club with 50 chains like I’m Busta
When I say fuck em, migos come and get em
OG Maco and Migos some real niggas
Got 50 pigeons in the charger
Pull up on the plug make that steal nigga
I'm pitchin' hardball like the Dodgers
I got the Green Bay pack, Aaron Rodgers
Chopper bullet coming, better dodge em
In the kitchen, cooking pot like a cobbler
I pull out the pistol like Mad Max off Shottas
[Verse 4 – Takeoff]
Yeah yeah yeah, like OG Maco said, fuck em, fuck em, fuck
 em
You ran off with the work but flexing in the city, Stupid motherfucker
My mama told me I can fuck em
But you better not never ever trust em
They say Actavis discontinued, check my cup I’m sipping muddy trouble
Pull up on a nigga at the red light
Hit em with the chopper he a dead motherfucker
You fuck with my money, it’s repercussions
Niggas start running when they see the chopper, a nigga gunning
Killing and itching and I got the bodies
 
Don’t know where to dump em
Wrapping the work like a mummy, finessing the plug for dummies
100K when I be kicking, pimping, dripping in London
When I open up the OG, smell like a bag of the Funyons
[Bridge]

Riding round in the A

[Verse 1 – Rich The Kid]
Touched down in the A
Maserati to Bugatti, a motherfucker start running from the paparazzi
Got 4 hoes in the pool of my Jacuzzi
Pull up, drop top, Phantom opera a movie
You see the diamonds in my watch, it ain’t a G-Shock
Balenciaga on my feet this ain't no Reebok
I'm at the W, never ever been to the double tree
Eating steak & shrimp on the yacht, fuck Applebees
Gianni Versace,

I got hoes from the A to the bay
Riding round and the coupe going crazy
[Hook]
[Verse 2 – Quavo]
Riding round in my Audi coupe

When I step inside the ‘rari, call me Crash Bandicoot
Blood diamond came from Africa, call me Al-Farouq
Lil' mama with the big ol' booty, come here
Have you ever been in an 8 passenger leer
She going crazy, private jet going crazy
Told the bitch to give me head in my grandmama’s ...
I ain’t give her nothing
Nah, Quavo ain’t a lover
You think I give a fuck about a bitch, I ain’t a sucker
She the past tense, got to make lil' mama absent
Versace, Versace, my fabric
Counting money in the mansion, your girl in the living room dancing
And it don’t take nothing to drop her panties
Quavo! (Gone!)
[Hook]
[Verse 3 – Takeoff]
Coming down Peachtree in the Aston
With a bad white bitch, Jennifer Aniston
Feeling Molly Santan’ again
My neighbors panicking
In my hood, every day I hear an ambulance
Ain’t a damn thing changed, still serving the J’s
Felicia, she want to borrow my microwave
Deebo still in the hood, creeping through your window
I’m fucking Mrs. Parker, took her to Puerto Rico
Me, Craig, and Smokey smoke dope and we be choking
Which watch should I wear today, the heavy Breitling or the Rollie?
Reached in my Robins and I pulled out guacamole
Ain’t have a clue what I was holding, F&N is what I’m toting
[Hook]


[Hook: Offset]
I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it
[Verse 1: Offset]
I'm goin' through it, man this shit so crazy
'07, lost my brother, 15 years in them cages
Now my grandma rest in peace, that was my first lady
Thousand dollar specs on my face to block the haters
Goin' through it right now but still chasin' the paper
My bitch fucked the whole team, I never should have saved her
And now I'm goin' crazy, cause I'm just goin' through it
I still walk around with Rugers cause I like to shoot 'em
I thought I loved that bitch to the mothafuckin' core
I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got me in a Porsche
Money, money, money, money got [?]
I'm rollin' up a 3-5 [?]
Feds watchin' me, still servin' J's, I'm paranoid
[Hook: Offset]
[Verse 2: Quavo]
I'm goin' through it, my niggas in the slammer
I had to go to Wal-Mart and collect some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin' [?]
Do numbers water whippin', Young Quavo, yeah I did it
My bitch, she smashed the whole team, damn that ho too friendly
So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, ain't leavin' my wealth to none of these bitches
Cause once you dead and gone, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Water whippin', show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley
[Hook: Offset]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I've been goin' through it, shit been crazy
2000, lost my cousin, cried like a baby
My ancestors been goin' through it, back then in slavery
Now the time faster, I am the master
Could've been me back then, nigga woulda been like "Fuck your master"
My name Takeoff, I am NASA
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, pop a zan like she pop a gun
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond
[Outro: Takeoff]
I'm goin' through it
2000, lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Made
Just lost my grandmomma
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Done took so many losses, it's only right that we win


[Hook]
Plug say he got a whole ton of midget
I'd like to welcome ya'll to the Green Light District
Green light district, Green Light District, Green Light
Green light district, Green Light District, Green Light
[Verse 1: Quavo]
I got that gas pack mega-ton green light
Run up on me I'mma take your life, 
walk in the trap just to see what the fiends like
Quavo Peter Piper had to pack a pistol
I got the shooter nigga, I won't miss you
Free my niggas, got the felonies, fuck the system
Blowing money with the plug like a whistle
The pot is butt naked
, I examine it like a physical
Listen up, this shit here critical
I can teach em how to make it identical
Remix, re-rock go fugazi on a nigga pot
Drip, drip, gotta sprinkle on the pot
Baking soda make a young nigga knot
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
It's a price on your fitted nigga, you better pay attention
30 round extension
Bullets all up in your mouth like it's dentures
You better surrender
Better listen to me, I'm your mentor
I'm not talkin' too much, ain't no lecture
You gon catch all these bullets like Fletcher
I pay them to kill you, I am an investor
(Greenlight)
Hit the fuck nigga with the four-four
I'm laughing like Elmo and I got more straps than velcro
You know what it is, green light the nigga and kill all his kids
I don't give a fuck about him, I had to show him what it is
[Hook]


[Hook: Quavo]
I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl
Don't know why I came in with these diamonds on my chain
Surrounded by bad bitches I can't get 'em out my face
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy?
Is it cause a nigga cook like a professor?
I don't know how you feel can you tell me
I won't know how you feel 'til you tell me
Is it cause a nigga handsome and wealthy
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Is it cause I'm a star
It maybe could be my star status
I got my chain and ring
My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
It could be that 4 hour flight, shopping in Beverly
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Ain't tryna spend no time
I know my bitch she so fine
But I don't know what's on her mind
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss
I put on my Louboutins playing golf
Young nigga walking with Nina Ross
I'm dropping the bombs like Viet Cong
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
They say I'm picky cause all my bitches exquisite
I'm in some vintage Givenchy smokin' a Philly
The dope that I sell is the purest
The junkies they hit it, they scratchin' and itchin'
The flow that we killin', the flow that we spittin'
My nigga you know we invented it
Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I'm a Migo but my bitch an immigrant
I got the boot but no Timberland
I am the plug, you the middle man
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I got 15 bricks I'm finna drop
In there right next to that carbon
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Is it my looks or is it my wealth?
Or is it the way that I carry myself?
Let me know I need some help
Don't keep that secret to yourself
Bitches be saying I'm acting funny cause a young nigga got a lotta money
She lookin' at me like she want somethin'
Can't give her nothin' but a couple hundreds
She sucked up on a nigga, tryna give a nigga kisses, baby girl you trippin'
(I don't know how you feel can you tell me)
I know why you came in this club tonight
Looking for a nigga that's gon' change your life
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Young Takeoff gon' flex, known for getting them checks
Known for hitting that lot, known for coppin' them 'Vettes
Known for dropping them bands, leaning like kickstands
All on the block, [?] in my hand
Some of the bricks be white, some of the bricks be tan
Got a plug on that gas, got a plug on them xans
Wrap the work in Saran,on the stove with pots and pans
Then cool it with the fan, then ship it to Japan
Imma show ya'll how to flex, Ya'll don't know the real definition of a flex
You ain't whip till the jewelry wrapped up on a chain just cause a young nigga had the check
Doing this shit since the age of seven
Getting money since the age 11
I'm all about a check and all a nigga do is flex
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Quavo]
Young ass nigga walking round here flexing
Spent 25 on my motherfucking necklace

Got lil' goons where they gon' stirk ya
Got too bad bitches they diking

[Hook: Quavo]
Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That’s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh (hit it!)
When a nigga hit the plug, when I nigga hit the trap and I hit em with the pump
Look at the pot, look at the egg beater, hit em with the uh (skkrt)
Hit em with it, hit em with it

Hit em with it, hit em with it
Hit em with it
Hit em with it, hit em with it

Hit em with it, man I’m tryna stretch it to a whole fifty
Hit the juug, man I’m tryna put you niggas on if you with it
You niggas in your own lane, Migo gang in a division
Hit the pot just for the extras, abracadabra it’s missing
Hit the pot, hit it hit it hit it, make em take that like Diddy
Fuck fuck nigga talking, pull up on the block with extensions
Look up the statistics, I’m worth a million
I might pull up in the coupe and hurt your feelings
If you shooting at a nigga, better hit him
Cause you never know, he could come back and hit you
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Hit em with it, remix em
Beat em with it, Imma go and beat em with it
I won’t ever leave it in her
Bullets [?] right now, you sweeter than a cinnamon
I’m checking my agenda, you niggas acting feminine
Had enough to pay my dividends, Migos I’m a citizen
It was evident we had to stay passionate
Pissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate
Hit em with the tackle
Pull out the chopper, not fronting I’ll rush em
Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel
I am not a mason but I’m rocking Margiella’s
Higher than a motherfucker, just like a propeller
I’m riding in the Mulsanne, Bentley got umbrellas
My plug’s too far so I tell a nigga mail em
[Hook]

Tryin to take it, bitch I'm titan, you know we clashin'
Chanel down,.....?, she know I'm splashin'
Came a long way from them corners, servin that ash
[Hook]
[Quavo]
I know that my life is so great
You hungry, you know that we already ate
I do what I want and you gotta work late
I fuck em I don't take em out on a date
You love her and cuff her and take her to skate
I make her go cook, she sniffin' the plate
I came from the bottom, 
and now I got gwuap
My nigga they know that you is a cheapskate
Put it on my mama, I got commas
Niggas hit ya, with that Llama
Keep runnin' with that sack
I just took his hunnas
Pull up in that Audi, flexin' in the summer
I got 50 bricks, on the plane, comin' from Tijuana
Christian Louboutin , $550 a piece that cost a lot
My niggas sellin' larry kush, and you know my niggas keep chris rock
All ya'll niggas lookin' like balloons, my bullets they gone pop
Black Maybach, Black tints, Quavo feelin' like Barack
[Hook](x2)
I was broke down on my knee

Skurrtt Skurrtt Skurrtt, pull up throwin money out my ceiling
Young Rich Nigga, fuck it, yeah, different life I'm livin'
[Takeoff]
I was broke down on my knees
Took me a long long time
Wouldn't nobody give me shit
I had to grind grind grind
Remember them days, I had to finesse for checks
And buss on you flats, I came at yo neck with the tec
My niggas is vicious, they hungry for benji
Pull up at the trap, I boarded my windows
Rich nigga fuck them, 
I'm a young rich nigga still
Standin' on stage, blowin' propane
Fuck a Styrofoam, I'ma drink it out the seal
,
Run up on Takeoff, make a nigga takeoff
That was A1, I ain't talkin' bout steak sauce
Me and thug throwed, and we need two cups
If my cup ain't double, its gone be some trouble
Came a long way, had to get it out the muscle
Now all my cars are muscles
Young nigga gotta get a hustle
Gotta use a wordplay like Ruzzle
If you want that cake, but you ain't got that cake
Gotta get out there and make somethin' shake
Got the 45 put it to a nigga face, rich nigga eatin' steak on Hermes plates
NO! I ain't never goin' broke, Early in the morning on the stove
Wrist spinnin' like a hurricane
Ice chain came from Johnny Dang
Real heavy on my neck I need a cane
All white bitch cocaine
I'm whippin' that birdy, with none of that whitney
That Brittney come with a free chicken, I live it
[Hook](x2)
I was broke down on my knee
Took me a long time to get it
80 Ps, straight gas
I done graduated from midgets
Skurrtt Skurrtt Skurrtt, pull up throwin money out my ceiling
Young Rich Nigga, fuck it, yeah, different life I'm livin'


[Intro]
Quavo: Guala!
Bieber: What's up Migos?
Quavo: What up JB, it's time to go to the club, time to pull those toys out man. Let's do it!
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
Hey where the party at? Let's go
Let's ride, Let's roll
Yea, everywhere I go
Them girls follow
Na, na, na, na
Let everybody know that I'm here tonight
As soon as I walk in the door
Pretty lady I think I need you in my life
In fact I know I need you for sure
[Pre-Hook: Justin Bieber]
Tonight might be the night
You might mess around and fall in love
And I might be the guy
That'll make you want to fall in love with him
Girl, what's your name, happy that you came
I'm the man in this, stick with me, and gain love
Everywhere around the world, don't you know, girl that
I'll be looking for you
[Hook: Quavo]
Is it her? Lookin' for you, lookin' for you
I'm not paparazzi or a stalker
She right in front of me looking for you, looking for you
Not the feds or a cop
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
I got money in my pocket and I ain't afraid to spend it
Ain't a problem baby girl, when you’re winning
Tell me what you wanna do, we can make a move now
Girl you ain't gotta fight the feelin', tell me why you grinning
(Look at her face)
I think you're likin' what I'm sayin'
Do I really gotta say any more?
(Say no more)
You need to know I ain't 
playin'
(I ain't playin')
Baby what are we waitin' for?
[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]
[Verse 3: Quavo]
Bad bitches in the party, alcohol on me
Tell the waitress put the sparklers on my 20 PTs (lean!)
I asked her what's her name - got the know she said Hannah
On the way to the mansion, said she loved the Panamera
In the trap with J.Bieber with my phone chirpin' like beepers
Mona Lisa, Anna Mae in the pot when I beat her
Take her 'cross the country, I got plugs on the Visa
Cut your man off little mama, you don't need him
[Verse 4: Takeoff]
Yeen never seen
 a nigga like me (TakeOff)
Hopping out, 
Giussepe steppin,
 
with a mink
Gold chain, Mr. T
In the summer, in a V12 Hummer with the leather seats
Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I think they watchin' me
I'm a vegetarian, all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli
Mansion out in Beverly, yo bitch call me call me "Your Majesty"
[Verse 5: Offset]
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage
I run to the money like Forrest
My life is historic
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon
I watch her like a telescope
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil TerRio
I got your bitch, she watchin' me like Tyler Perry shows
I'm young and I'm rich, ridin' in a Phantom Ghost
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo
[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]


(Hook)
Seen 100 bands, all in one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mind cuz my mama seen it
 
(fuck!)
And she had a fit, yea she had a fit (mama)
I told my mama we rich, told my mama we rich (rich, go!)
Seen 100 bands, all in one time
 (I did)
I just blew my mind cuz my mama seen it (fuck!)
And she had a fit, yea she had a 
fit
 (mama)
I told my mama we rich, told my mama we rich (go go go go)
(Verse) (Quavo of the Migos)
Mama had a fit when she seen my money
She say you ain’t got no job, you must be up to something
What the hell you doin? Don’t get in no trouble
I had to look out for my nephew, he look up to uncle
Mama got a nigga, I ain’t like his ass
Tried to make me rake the leaves and cut the grass
Nigga you ain't even got no kids, what make you dad?
If I wasn't 12 years old I’d bust yo ass!
Mama kicked him out and now I’m 21
Bought her Prada, Gucci, Louis, Christian Loubuitton
Mama taught me everything, I’m her Danielson
I had to go get her that Porsche before the summer’s gone
(Hook)
(Verse) (Gucci Mane)
I was servin junkies out my mama window
I was broke like half a brick, that was ‘96
Daddy gone so I guess that makes me head honcho
Mama ramblin through my closet, she done found a spliff
She said I raised you better, boy you’ve got a strong mind
She said I can’t believe you serve that to your own kind
I told her mama chill cuz I been broke along time
That’s why I’m at the store and junkies in a long line
I was a runner for my brother, I need my own plug
I feel like 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne, I need my own drugs
First time I set shop on my block I didn’t get no luck
200 thousand for a Charger, 6’s, no scrub
(Hook)
(Verse) (Takeoff of the Migos)
The Audi, the Mazzi, the Jaguar
The Bentley, the house by the lake
Gold on my neck, gold on my wrist
Young Takeoff I sit on 10 K’s
I’m posted with Guwop, I’m strapped up with 2 Glocks
Versace on my back, I’m feelin like 2 Pac
He wanted a whole brick, I gave em re-rock
Pull up on yo block, Chevrolet t-top
Finesse the plug for the bags
My wrist is spinnin like Taz
I know that my mama gone spaz
She find out bout all of this cash
But fuck it, my nigga we rich
Remember them nights hitting licks
Duckin police, jumpin the fence
Now we in Lambs, president tint
(Hook)
Seen 100 bands, all in one time (I seen it)
I just blew my mind cuz my mama seen it (fuck!)
And she had a fit, yea she had a fit (mama)
I told my mama we rich, told my mama we rich


[Intro: Meek Mill]
Started with a dollar and dream
From riding Impala with them things
To driving Ferraris with them wings, nigga
Young rich niggas, Migo, Meek Milly
[Verse 1: Meek Mill & (Quavo)]
Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
(Let me talk, Meek Mill)
[Hook: Quavo]
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions (bet you didn't know)
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison (sad to say)
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
[Verse 2: Quavo]
All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
(On) camera like Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator
[Verse 4: Offset]
I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, 
seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "give a nigga some faith"
Now when I wake up I look at my label
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!
[Hook]

Got to have a gas mask in the kitchen cause I cough
Move the work out to Memphis so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know that you false
Rick Ross ain’t the only nigga in the world boss
Put the Forgi’s on the old school, riding Chevy T-top
When a nigga walk up on me, freeze him like a freeze pop
Feeling like a DJ, hit em with the rerock
Feeling like I’m lost nigga rerock on the D-block
Fucking with the Chi-town niggas out in O-block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on your block

Got a thousand niggas with me, they looking for you like bounties
Imma put a tax on the gas moving out the county
Sipping active, got me drowsy, trapping, capping, Maui Waui
I got bricks up in the U-haul, I got workers in the mountains
How fast can you count it, my nigga I don’t need to count it

Bricks up in Florida, they calling me a Seminole

[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Drinking on Activis, whip the work then I’m packing it

Though the work is immaculate, I be trapping and dabbing it
On the island I’m cooling it, had the kush in my Loubotins
That's an intruder in the window, I’m shooting

Pull up with choppers with the coolers in it

Meanwhile I'm over here in a foreign country, nigga wanna know who done it
You gotta survive, the jungle safari, I'm a legend alive
You got no rings like Amar'e, pull out the chopper I'm sorry
Do you remember the days I was down, I couldn't afford it
Now I'm on, got the Bently coupe, and it came equipped with the Forgis
Take him back to the bando, when a nigga had a J snortin'
OTF and Migo Gang, young, rich niggas important

Young nigga tryna make a dope deal
They askin' me questions like Dr. Phil
Got excited when I seen a half a mil'
I was playin' just to get a record deal
Now we independent, worth a couple M's
Came a long way from bustin' out sticks and stems

So you the grinch who stole Christmas
I got the OG [?] Christmas tree
[Hook: Quavo]


[Hook: Quavo]

They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
Up in the game
Look at my house, take a long at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day

And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Nigga, they bucking, they rubbing, they sacking
Taking the pounds and breaking them down
What a beautiful day, my AKK recouped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
Just another day on the North side rollin' (rolling)
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac all eyez on me (2Pac)
My young nigga hit a 100 band jugg in the club it was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side

You gotta survive ,the streets will eat you alive
They say we wear make up, but that was a lie
Broke in them houses, no regular ball
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard

Trap house jumpin' like Jordan

Pull up in the drop top Phantom
Niggas in the hood can't stand em

Yo bitch think I'm rom

My whip game make you panic, my plug is Phil Jackson
Feeling like Mutombo, I got all these Kush bowls

Trap game Elvis Presley, you can't impress me
Dark skin ho can cook the dope, she look like Nestle
[Hook: Rich The Kid]
[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Got the trap house jumpin' like Kobe
Cashed out, hundred K on a Rollie
You ain't one of me, nigga, don't talk to me, nigga
I'm a real ass nigga, you phony
In the kitchen whippin' up them babies
Make the Pyrex trap go crazy
Young nigga got money, young nigga got work
Young nigga got crack like the 80s
I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm dunkin', I'm dunkin'
I'm Jordan, you're not even Kobe
In the kitchen with a Pyrex pot

Twenty racks on me, got tats on me
In the bed with six hoes like two times three
[Hook: Rich The Kid]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Trap house jumpin' like Jordan
I’m a free man, no Morgan!
That choppa, it take out you organs
I play with them keys, no organ!
Your bitch in my kitchen, she snorting
The lean, I’m pouring, I'm snoring
I’m making them plays in Delaware
Versace, Medusa my underwear
Who the fuck, nigga better have haircare
You don't trap on the block if you dont live there
The trap be jumpin', and bunking, the fiends they running, the money keep comin'
I'm kicking hoes out like a punter, if i start shooting, turn to a track runner
I'm calling up Rich, he bringing the kids, Whipping the babies all summer
[Hook: Rich The Kid]


[Hook: Quavo]
Night time night, night time night

Bring the shooters out, bring the uzis out
Night time night, night time night
Night time night, night time night
Bring the goons out, Bring the shooters out
Bring the woolies out, bring the uzis out
[Verse 1: Quavo]
All my niggas keep that Arma 15 in the club
That's that Mario Chalmers
Bet I pull the roolie
Bet I pull the Uzi
If you run up on me sun that chopper it gon' do you
My niggas don't play soccer, so we don't like to kick it
My niggas play with calculators, numbers, and lil' tickets
My niggas keep the carbon, birds singing just like Marvin
Night time with the wooly find you in the morning
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Night night, them goons don't move in daylight
You trying to get hit with the K right?
Them goons gonna shoot for a low price
Aimin' at your potato
Beat a nigga up like I'm Cato
Italian plug named Fredo
All white bricks look like mayo
Lose your life, you gon' lose your life
Pull out that big white chopper with the knife
Cut you up, you look like pizza slice
We don't give a fuck
You can roll the dice, try your luck
Bring them choppers up
Don't think you too big to get touched
[Hook]


[Intro: Takeoff]
No, No, no no
I ask shawty what's up and she was fucking with me (she was)
I told the plug to front me, he was fucking with me (I swear he was)
I swear I told her, they sit back and laugh at me (they was)
Now I'm Richie Rich, got these haters mad at me (rich!)
[Hook: Takeoff]

Niggas never gave me shit,

Plug ain't front me shit, 
turn that ten to a whole 36 (flipping that)
Remember when I met that bitch (remember that bitch?)
She wasn't fucking with me

They wasn't fucking with me and now that I'm rich
I don't wanna fuck with them
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Quavo]
I told them I was gonna make it and they laughed
My teacher told me that I was gonna never pass math
Yeah she was right
80 thousand old hundreds, Jerry Rice
I didn't get a diploma, I'm rich for life
They didn't believe me, BET, MTV, made you see it
Lil' mama she wasn't fucking with me
I had to go get some new bitches
The plug he wasn't fucking with me until I got all them Benjis
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
No you are not fucking with meee
When I ain't had no currency (where were you?)
You know you left a nigga hanging, treated me like I'm a stranger
The plug he wasn't even fronting me a key (fuck the plug)
But it's no pressure
I'ma take the little nick and I'll flip it
, I'ma flex on you like a wrestler
Even since a nigga stopped fucking with you baby girl, my life been better
And I'm successful, Michael Phelps in my bezzles
I did this on my own, with no help from nobody
[Hook]

Thirty thousand just to look at the time (30k)
Twenty five hundred for my Louboutin (Ha)
Mansion Elan was our stomping ground
Our money big, your money minimized (big money)
Taking shots cause your buzz died
Cutting the top off the Lamb' make it circumcised (skkrt skkrt)
The world is fucked up but the strong survive
[DJ Ray G]
Haha, name your favourite club in Atlanta, my nigga
We ran that shit
We turned Mansion Elan
Into Migos Elan, nigga
We turned obsessions, in the Migos Playhouse nigga

Our main bitch, our side bitch, her side bitch, her side bitch worked there, nigga
We run this motherfuckin' city
We started new Atlanta
These niggas jackin' our swag
, they better stand in line
And pay, bitch!


[Verse 1: Quavo]
Migos in the building what she came to see
She want to ball she told me she was a fan of me
No mediocre have you ever played a game of 
strip poker
You too bad I can't have you whipping Toyota Corollas
Spanish lil' mama she call me senor
Vámonos andele she want some more
Fifty bad bitches on my yacht all aboard
I'm swaggin' and Mick Jaggin' [?] sharp like a sword
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Said she want to takeoff and come with me right around my city
We got our feet up sipping margaritas big plate of linguine
She a bad girl like riri but a house wife like Nini
My diamonds is looking like water, vvs is looking like ecstasy
She down to make a porno follow if you take a photo
You could've been at the mansion but I hit that in the condo
She screaming YRN, man that's nothin' but Migos promo
Migos chain three amigos you know that's the Migos logo
[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice, now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy, rest in peace, Whitney
Pardon me but I don’t think none of these bitches fucking with me
Want a billboard bitch? Stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get 'em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady, fuck you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick, stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me?
[Hook: T.I.]
All I fuck bad bitches, I don't want no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I don't want no mediocre, no!
Bad mamcitas, ain't no mediocre ho
Don't want no mediocre, I won't hit no mediocre, yeah
Bad bitch stuntin' on them mediocre hoes
On them mediocre, you stunt on them mediocre, 7
Women with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre
[Verse 4: Offset]
I don't want no mediocre that mean I don't want no local
We can go shop at Rodeo while you bounce on me like pogo
Take trips to Barbados where we can dip off and lay low
Have a convo about peso, stick together like lego
I feeling her tip she giving me mental
I'm beatin' it up no instrumental
She popping it on me like a pimple
I'm trapping the birds she like a criminal
You know we splurge she gave me the word, I bought her a Birkin
She wanted a Bentley not a Suburban
I came here from Africa mama from Persia
She bad making me nervous
[Verse 5: T.I.]
Right hand in the air, I solemnly swear
I never go down if she don’t do her hair, no more
You won’t get no kiss if it’s a bush down there
Girl, I should see nothing but nookie when I look down there
Hey, come get with me, what better to do?
He call and ask how you doin, tell him "Better than you", yeah
I’m kicked back with four pieces like a Kit Kat
Me hiting if you ain’t a dime, just forget that
Pretty face, fat ass, if she don’t have
Have one of these, well, I think I’ll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it, I took it back
You shoulda asked for a Benz, that’s mediocre
[Hook: T.I.]


[Hook: Quavo]
I can buy that car, I know that you can't

I can afford your bitch, I know that you can't
I can afford my wrist, I know that you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't
I can buy the bar, I know that you can't

[Verse 1: Quavo]
No you can't, no you can't
You don't sip that lean by the pint
You a peon, you don't got rank
Call the plug up, get a pound of stank
Quavo Stuntin, name hold weight
In the kitchen and I make a earthquake
When you walk around, pocket full of cake
Gotta keep your grass low, full of snakes
Chevrolet SS on skates
Got a white girl, her name Kate
Got a Chinese girl named Ling
She love to pop them [?]
Got a rocket on my hip, Yao Ming
Get money in my dreams
In the hood, they call me king
In the Ville or the Upper 100 wings
Can't walk cause I'm sippin' on lean
Got a 9, call me Luol Deng
Ever since a young nigga [?]
Don't never let the money make me
Grow up to be what I wanna be
Don't ever let a nigga make me
And I put that on my momma
My pockets filled up with lasagna
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Got bands, I ain't talkin' 'bout a college
I got a foreign bad bitch, she exotic
All black, little nigga, wearin' gothic
Uppercut a nigga like Bernard Hopkins
Got flavor, no Baskin and Robbin
Pull up in the Batman with the Robin
You playin', ain't 'bout no bottle
Sip codeine out the baby bottle
Grape Maserati look like a [?]
You [?]
You can still rock an Artful Dodger
Real G, blowin' up, Pearl Harbor
Cut the work like a nigga was a barber
In the kitchen with them toddlers
In the hood with them robbers
In the bando with them choppers
I'ma G like the Green Bay Packers
Young Takeoff, call me NASA
Fuck with my money
That chopper gon' stretch you out like cardiovascular
You can't even flip no brick
You can't even flip no nick
You never had purple codeine
Your Sprite always look clean
Sip lean, double cupped with the ice
Drop 85 hundred for the ice
When a nigga talk crazy, hang his ass
Like Suge did Vanilla Ice
Wish a nigga would try to steal my ice
88 birds in the trunk, Jerry Rice
You can't do that real nigga shit
Know some young niggas, eleven, walkin' 'round with the Emmett
[Hook: Takeoff]


[Gucci Mane]
Baby keep me on my P's,

These shoes don't come out this season, but still they on my feet
[PeeWee Longway]
Old folk keep calling us heathens, too many drugs on the street
I'm servin' right down by 4 Seasons, niggas from the pen won't weep
[Quavo]
PeeWee got the bricks and the bales, 
listen up to the story I tell
The bricks, they came from the mail, my plug his name is Miguel
[Takeoff]
I'm in the kitchen, counting up benji's
Yo bitch washing dishes and wrapping up fishes
Used to run from the cops on the block, hit four hot bar

If I don't know ya, I'mma get ya rerock
Got a bando in Boston
The way I pitch them 8-balls, shoulda played for the Red Sox
[MPA Wicced]
Just took a loss, 'bout to take something off
Put it to the head, make her open up the vault
Say you got bird, head all in a loss
Soon as you turn the key boy you bout to get off
[
Offset

Bought a brand new A-P, but I'm always late
Everyday my birthday, now watch me bake cake
[
MPA Duk
e]
I finesse the plug for the drugs
Even though a nigga always show love
If he ain't Migos, he ain't MPA
Brick Squad, nigga you ain't my blood
Tryna hit my blunt, tryna sip my drank

Ain't shit soft around my way
Unless you talkin' 'bout cocaine

Show love to my people, pull up in the Lotus, I look like a creature
Got cash on me, no Visa

Migos!
 
Metro!
I mean all I ever wanted to be
Y'all know what we wanted to be
Uh, rich!
[Hook: Quavo]
All I ever wanted was some motherfuckin' guala (money)
Bando used to smell like some stinkin' enchiladas (bando)
The streets is a jungle, got to watch for the koalas (snoopers)
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces, ounces
Ounces, ounces, ounces (x3)
Whole lot of ounces! (whole lot)
Ounces, ounces, ounces (x2)
All I ever wanted was to get rid of them ounces
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Walk around with large amounts of guala on me
I’m walking around with a pocket rocket, don’t run up on me lonely
Bought my first Audi with the fish scale guts
Now I got the bitches, wanna fuck, they wanna cuddle up
Wanna come to the bando, knock two times then twist the handle
Got everything in stock, whatever you need, just ask me
I’m selling that kush to Asher,
 real money, got a whole bag of Ashley
Money taller than mountains,
 
drinking lean out of damn water fountains
She so bad gave me erection or eroused, whatever you call it
Bitch, me and my team been balling
Bet your label keep motherfucking calling
Woke up to a bitch this morning, got 16 new text message
10 of em' saying "go get to the guap", other 6 saying "Migos up next"
G-g-g-g-gone!
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
When I was a kid all I wanted was a hundred dollar bill
Now I’m 19, young nigga want 100 mil
Selling whole things, want an ounce? Can't bust the seal
Wanna be a trapper? Never serve a nigga where you live
In the Bando counting chips no poker,
 
weighing bales of Okra
I got lots of O's, put my name right next to Al Capone
I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Selling that dope to economists, menace to society
On the top of the mountain, you under me
Young nigga, I’m trapping and grinding
No scale for the workers, I'm eying it
You niggas still nickel and diming
Remix the dope and you niggas still buying it
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Fuck the rap game cause these rap niggas really ain't shit
I hop in the Audi, I hop in the Bentley
Fuck it I’m smashing that bitch
Young rich nigga with the Rollie wrist
Trapping and capping, I’m selling the birdie
You fuck niggas really ain't serving
Selling the bricks to the plug up in Berlin
Put the dope in the water, hit it with the egg beater
Sipping lean, yeah I'm good on tequila
My neck is so sick, got the measles
This for my my niggas that trap in the Regal
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Put the molly on top of her tongue
She sucking and fucking, she ain’t got no manners
Back to the basics, I’m counting these faces
My pockets inflating off trapping and baiting
You niggas fugazy, my niggas, they strapped like the Navy
I’m the mayor, matter fact, I’m the president
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
Throwing the bird with accuracy, all of you niggas is amateur
Pull up in Phantoms, but trap out of Challengers

We don’t even kick it like that dog
Quick to spray a nigga like Lysol
Don't get mad at me cause I smashed your bitch then I passed her like Chris Paul

Black and grey muscle truck, they'll be renting soon
And the paint with the work out in Jers

White in the trunk, got it smelling like skunk
Gas, gas, they callin' up 12 we gone mad
Here take all these pocket rockets bitch
Put 'em in yo' Birkin bag
What you gone do at the top floor
Grab the parachute, hit the window
Quavo you trippin' hell naw
I ain't gettin' caught with all this indo
[Hook]
[Verse 2 : Rich The Kid]
Pack gone missing, I'm no magician
My diamonds they flyin' like Bobby and Whitney
Walking around with a 50
My bitch in the trap naked in the mansion no bra and no panties
You mad cause I'm rich
Cuffin' and loving that bitch
We smash and we switch
I pull up to bando with bricks in a Bent'
I stand round the trap like a fence
Finessin' I run with the money
I'm wrappin' and shippin' the dummy, Houdini me
The kitchen I'm mixing them chemicals nigga no chemistry
Rich niggas in Paris they takin' them pictures
She suck it, she swallow, you probably kiss her
Woosh! Pack gone missing
Rich The Kid still finessin'
I'M RICH!
[Hook]
[Verse 3 : Wiz Khalifa]
Got so many hoes on my line you think I'm fishing
She might be a girl, turn around that thing gone missing
Her and her start kissing, liquor in her system
Don't be standing near me in the club, go get some bitches
Got a crib without a ceiling when I hit it you gone feel it
It's my new motto, nigga, anyone can get it
Damn, smoking papers, my new crib come with acres
Gettin' cake with just the wave of a hand
You think I had a pay for something
[Verse 4 : Offset]
I think it's a ghost in the city
I hustle I feel like I'm Nipsey
Patrolling you missing, so where did he go?
Send my young nigga kick through yo' back door (BOW!)
As anybody seen the pack lately
They knockin' my door like the candy lady
I don't know what the fuck want these niggas
These niggas be snitchin', bitches want a baby
The pack it gotta go (Fheww!)
Beep, beep! Truck load
Whippin' and cookin' up Anna Nicole
Versace got me travelin' across the globe
Blue money, blue hundreds
The gas smellin' like it's fungus
Woosh! Pack gone missing
Ride 'round the city, 30 round extensions
[Hook]
[Verse 5 : Chevy Woods]
Shout out to all my connects in the hood I'm finally famous
Shout out Big Sean and I don't mean the rapper that coke made me famous
Woosh, hey, they try to get me for the pack
Woosh, hey, like nigga who the strap (Blam, blam!)
Huh, I had to jump it straight out of the pot I be cookin' the oil
Don't got no connect for you pussy ass niggas you'll never be loyal
Beyoncé with all of this money you know that I got a big ego
Robin Hood, I'm in the hood and I'm tryna look out for my people
[Hook]

The crazy ass wrist boy, I make a hurricane
[Hook x2]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
I got Kush in my blunt, and it's lime green
Take out that Zippy, or the sticky, and that G-13
Riding in that Audi, got ten bowls of that Maui
Niggas out here in these streets, they Hungry Howie
Your BBS's ain't official they look cloudy
Hard top coup, but the inside Bounty
My lil Migo pull up on you, serve a couple brownies
Gotta strip the scene cause the block hot like a cauldron
Khaki foreign bad bitch, please excuse her manners
Straight drop dope, make the fiends go bananas

Remember me kickin in doors and giving you jewelry from where it was stolen?
Now it's Maserati splashin' sideways
Never been scared to get paid
Throwing money on the highway
Not the Carlito, the Migos' Way
Dinosaur, alligator, komodo dragon or Giuseppe toes
Andale came with my Payola
Don't make me jump off the top rope
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
All I need is a stove and a bando
30 minutes, make a milli, Alejandro
I be playing with them bowls but no banjo
We don't sugar coat
AK split your cantaloupe
Adam Sandler, I control my hoes with no remote
Quality Control in every magazine article
You thinking 'bout robbing me
Better off shooting yourself, Plaxico
No scientist, for you snakes, I got the antidope
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Broccoli, Broccoli
Young Offset on top of you niggas like I'm an apostrophe
No Monopoly
I'm sticking these niggas don't make me take your momma property
You niggas is pussy acting like a diva
Got the 40 on my hip like a beeper
You don't want no problems with the Grim Reaper
When it come to money niggas get evil
I'm not gon' let up like I'm DG Yola
Double seals from Minnesota
Guiseppes and now they walking on komodos
No vending machine but I'm selling that coca
Yola, Payola, Payola
The feds they ran in my trap
But they didn't find the bricks cause they was in the sofa
[Hook]

[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Double R Ghost nigga peekaboo

Shaquille O'Neal  how I block a shot
Three Amigos I might chill at the sharks
Booting your bitch up with molly rocks
That Rolex ain't real if it tic-toc

Quavo wanna see you pop it nasty
Lil mama so thick, look like Kim Kardashian
But no I'm not wifing, young nigga passin'
She making Impala at the 4th of July
She know I got millions, no need to lie
Tattoo on her booty is a butterfly
I bet when she make it pop, it's gonna fly
Soda pop booty, she poppin' her booty like popcorn, and it's wobblin'
Wanna take her home, when I get in my room, when I get the pussy, I'mma dive in it
She make me wanna have a million babies, when she poppin' the booty, hop-scotchin' it
I reach in my pocket, I slap her on the ass, told her she better not stop poppin' it
Everybody know that she a cutie
You keep spendin' money, she make you foolish
But look at me, Young Quavo, I'mma do it
She poppin' it on me, she make me lose it
I run out of cash, hit the ATM
I'm livin' my life like the game of Sims
She stomp the booty on me like a pair of Timbs
I end up leavin' the club at 6 AM
[Hook:]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Freaky deaky, pussy drippin', leakin'
White girls, I got jungle fever
Her booty jumpin', every beat out the speaker
Hit her one time, then I leave with the leader
Run around, jump up and down like a pogo
IPhone my camera, we might make a porno
I had to pipe her up, my game for a makeover
Private jet to LA, we don't do layovers
Ooo, Oh, piercings in the nipples, piercings in the dimples, pop it like a pimple
She nasty, bet you didn't know her daddy a pastor, laughter
She in my trap while she poppin' the castle
Speed it up, then she go slow
Grippin' that pussy, do the tootsie roll
She go harder than the concrete
Italian tailor, Givenchey
Money longer than a bungy
All this damn gold like a treasury
Lick on me like I am licorice
Burkin bag, she's a expensive bitch
She ratchet, she still got the kinky twist
Pop it, pop it, in my Bentley bitch
[Hook:]
[Verse 3: 
Takeoff
]
The way that she suckin it, I might be taking 
it
Breaking it but no relationship
Bigger booty, no big booty Judy
Her pussy wet when she get on that percocet
She looked at my hand, saw it full of bands
Put a little bit, bitch pop that
I'm throwin' cash, cash, all niggas see is ass
It must be an ass attack
Do you want some of these old hundreds baby?
I'm talkin' older than Thundercats
She shakin', she know her ass fat
Got me thinkin' where is her momma at
All the bitches starin' at you in the club
Cause they know that you be poppin' that
She breakin' it, makin' the club shake
She done gave the old man a heart attack
She shakin' like Shakira, look in the mirror
No ass shots, her booty real
She poppin' her nigga no Activis seal
Bad bitches tell me how you feel
All my rich niggas stand in the mirror
Mirror, mirror, it's a million here
Migo chain lookin' like chandeliers
Shakin that ass like its fast and furious

That Audi I don' pulled out, That Masi I don' pulled out
That [?] on everything I pulled out

Money, power, ammunition, guess I'm addicted
[Verse 1 : Quavo]
Quavo!
Whoa, Addicted to the money, man
Ugh! Touch down on the plug for a hundred bands
Make the work flip like its gymnastics
Cartwheel or a handstand
They calling my spatula acrobat
I'm turning a brick to a platinum plaque
You put too much dope on that fishscale
My pockets is deeper than water wells
Plug on the border, got ships on the water
They stuffing the bricks in Beluga Whales
Young nigga just Giuseppe walkin'
House in Miami I'm kicking shit with the Dolphins
You hard on the web call him Peter Parker
Stuffed crust smoking Nikki Parker (Gas)
Gone!

Bando no cable (bando no cable?)
Travelling country to country
Skipping a stable, I'm whippin Mrs. Mabel

Money we makin, without a major
Ain't signing a contract and selling my soul
Cuz everything glitter ain't gold (it ain't)
Double D told me dont fold
The water so cold your partner gon' turn to a four
Dont trap on the block if you dont belong
Straps in my jeans but I ain't talkin' Girbauds
Box of cocaine on a tractor trailer
Sippin on Activis call me the activator
Terminate you like the Terminator
We at the top of the mountain no elevator
Money, pounds, and ammunition
Me, Flip, and LongWay in the kitchen
The labels they made us ridiculous
Cuz QC we independent

Keep god in your prayers
Just a millionaire in that sports coupe you lookin at
Gadgets on the Aston stoppin traffic I'm a space cadet

Ammunition, we got plenty
FNn's, Ak's and fifties
Baby chopper, clip longer than a toddler
I never been a lame, never had a bitch called me Rodger

Your bitch wanna fuck cuz she see the diamonds
Stevie wonder, my VV's, I know they blinding
Hundred chains on my neck look like Busta Rhymes
I got out of jail to a goldmine
For you niggas that bustin my choppa gon bust
And gon hit em, gon flip em, gon make a concussion
Offset a Migo, my plug is amigo
He sendin me kilos, I fuck with Carlito
The pounds, them ounces, them grams

Brokanese niggas I dont understand
Karate chop a brick like I'm in Japan
Wrappin a brick in Saran


[Hook]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope, swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope, straight from Mexico call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope, swear to God we go Rambo

[Verse 1: Quavo]
My bitch she bad, she foreign, she cookin', she trappin', Quintana
But if she smoke my dope, I'mma hang her on a rope
She naked she cooking the coke, put it on a boat
The gas is coming from mexico, Rambo
Come with a plug with the pounds and bowl
These hoes cannot take my soul
My niggas be hitting them juugs and licks
My nigga be flippin' the bricks
Excuse me I take a shit
Skrrt, I juggled a chick

My nigga we trappin', we rich
[Hook]

Call it Quintana I got a bitch cooking Madonna she look like Rihanna
Got flavors like I'm Willy Wonka, no Tarzan I trap in the jungle
I'm whippin' and whippin' and flippin' and flippin'
I'm in the kitchen cookin' infants
The twins I'm whippin, Mary and Ashely
Got my jar smellin like chitlins
“My niggas we vicious no Sid
I’m bustin' I’m strapped and I’m Billy the Kid.”
And I'm sippin' on lean, two cups no lid
What you rap about I did
Forgive for sinning, I talk to the Lord I know what I did but I was a kid
Young Rich Nigga, I set the trend
Talkin' bout Benjamins, then I want in
[Bridge: A$AP Bari]
La Flame, don't play no games

Now I wrap my money up
I gotta stay away from dirty bitches and these motherfuckin' snakes
Back then lil' mama actin' funny now I'm gettin' to the money
These hoes suckin' and fuckin' for certain under curtains
Chains goes to my watch
"Skrrr" and the Phantom goes drop
Coming in the lane, tryna kick shit
Dikembe Mutumbo the block
Don't knock to my house
But I got low prices at the bando
Quavo the head Hancho
Got hoes on me like a pancho
[Hook]
[Verse 2 : Takeoff]

My bitch she be hanging with killers and gangstas
Damn it that shit Mama Mia
So you ain't keepin' her from a career
I dun ran up the money I feel like Usain Bolt

Meetin' back up with Carlito to pick up a kilo he put me on Nino
Nino the nigga got rich off a nigga that molly from Argentina
[Hook]
[Verse 3 : Offset]

Fuckin' your bitch my dick in her stomach
Talkin' 'bout money like Chris Brown; we run it!
Trappin' and cappin' keep bombs like atomic
Broke nigga make me vomit
You don't have food in your stomach
Thinkin' about takin' a young nigga's sack and we leavin' your head like a pumpkin
My niggas workin' just like Perkins
Your niggas they stay on the block
Re-up with the plug, hit the pounds and the rock
And the young niggas they pulled out the Glock
[Hook]


[Intro]

[Mango and Takeoff]
Say ya wanna live like a young rich nigga
Like a young rich nigga? (What ya wanna do?)
Say ya wanna live like a young rich nigga
Like a young rich nigga? (Say ya wanna be?)
Say ya wanna roll a three five in a Backwood
Or a Swisher? (Gas!)
Say ya wanna have shooter wit ya when ya trap
You ain't even got a pistol
Say ya wanna
Boy I know ya wanna
Nigga you a bitch don't ya wanna
Bustin' up the pussy like a condom
Bullets coming fast like a Zonda
Bullets coming hotter than a sauna
We stay with the toys like Tonka
Different color diamond Willy Wonka...
Never talk to your honor
I plead the fifth, i'm ese' for the summer
Ran up my sack i'm addicted to commas
Only get sleep on the lean in a coma
Walk in the store and go talk to the owner
Trap on the block the bando on the corner
Heavy artillery like i'm Osama
OG, good gas, you can smell the aroma
President tint like i'm riding with Obama
President tint like i'm riding with Obama
Where is Michelle?
Takeover your city
??? (Outer space man, Gone)
Got 50 bricks in a V12
On the block serving them bales
Ducking and dodging i'm running from 12
Takeoff ain't taking no L's
Cause I keep the steel
Nigga trying to bite me Holyfield
100 round drum overkill
Think i'm the NAVY the way I be popping seals
What ya wanna do?
What ya wanna be when ya grow up?
50 migos when I pull up
Hunnid' hoes on my tour bus
Damn, who the hell is he?
Extendos and choppers whenever we pull up
Gold on me like slick tha ruler
Shout out to my jeweler
Iced out my Franck Muller
Iced out my Franck Muller
My neck is a cooler
My diamonds albino
I'm countin' the riches no Lionel
I'm smoking a pound of that OG
I'm reading the Bible
I'm playing with the rifle
I think i'm a sniper
2 twin choppers like the towers
For this stuffed crust
You gone need bout three lighters
Pocket full of Jackson
Where is Michael?
When you walk in my bando, see dirty diapers
All I ever wanted was a sack
Every migo in my hood kept a stack
Fuck up a check
I'm a get it right back
Whether I kick me a door
Or get it back in the TRAP!
I remember niggas sending shots subliminal
Tweeting on twitter so it got political
If I ever see ya it's gone get physical
Texas Lone Ranger danger
No Mystikal
Christian my Louboutins
Giuseppe steppers
I might just go
Maison Margiellas
Like i'm Roc-a-fella
Fly like a propeller
My diamonds they can shine in any weather
Boxing rings on my knuckles Mayweather
Yes this is real fox fur fuck nigga
Covering my mink chinchilla
What do you wanna be when you grow up?
What did you wanna do when you got up?
I hit da lot, cop a audi
When to the kitchen grabbed the spatula
That stick is magical
Beating babies with the pots and pans
Shit is tragical
I'm the ambassador
Pull up in a Lamborghini
It's a Aventador
Independent nigga, riding wit a hunnid' mill
I can get a life sentence
Block hot, 12 on a nigga
Cause they heard I juug'd about a hunnid pigeons
Red on the bottom my Louboutins
At the court side like i'm Jack Nicholson
Still got the pocket rocket
Neva catch me slipping
Master P i'm bout
[Quavo]
Heeeeey
Quavo!
Holmes

Chopping bricks like wow

Diamonds shine

Pull up to the club
Looking like a fucking stanger
Oooh gone
[Offset]
The bigger the risk the bigger the reward
50 chickens on the highway
Escorting a brick a hundred more
I just touchdown on the plug I just scored
Hunnid' round in the chopper (Oh Lord)
Connected to the streets without a cord
50 hunnid' bricks up on a boat all aboard
My patna' Givenchy Balenciaga
Coming through ya winter call me Roger
It ain't bout' a dollar then why bother? (huh)
That gold on yo' neck look like copper
You snitching? You must be a crime stopper
I'm selling that white girl call it Mary Poppins
I'm pitching the work like a quarter back option
Double cup filled to the top, pure toxin
I am a leader niggas follow suit
When I go to the church, diamonds on me no suit
This is a family, not just a group
My nigga stick together, we win or we lose
Beatin' the pot and I gave it a bruise
These bitches they ain't shit
They fuck you and your crew
Stomp on you niggas like I am a Q
OG gas bag, it's smelling like puke
The devil fucking wit me he get 
rebuked
50 floors up nigga what a great view
I just beat the case, cause my lawyer a Jew
I'm sipping on actavis, good on the brew
What a miracle i'm living superior
Niggas can't fuck wit' us period
Niggas be hating saying that we not lyrical
Stand on the stove and i'm whipping the chemical
Finessing the plug and i'm acting delirious
Jumped off the porch cause a nigga was curious
You live and you learn off experience
Nigga do better
Nigga get some benjamins
You ballin' yo fist up, my nigga just listen...
Me and the pot got a very good chemistry
Used to fail chemistry
Now I pull up in a Bentley
Now these niggas they gone envy me
Go!


[Hook: Quavo]
First kicked the door when I was 17 years old
Seen my first 50, ballin', 18 years old
Let that pistol go when I was 19 years old
First time turned 20, I was cashin' out on gold
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, ye ain't live your life like mine
Rich nigga timeline, rich nigga timeline
Rich nigga timeline, stay the fuck up out of mine
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Free my nigga Westside, locked up to this day
R.I.P. my migo P, my nigga dead in the grave
And I dare a fuck nigga come and try me today
Abracadabra his face
Quavo the magician, the pack gone it's missin'
I got a ho and she got a ho and now they both kissin'
Do you remember, the life I was livin'?
I'm callin' the plug, I'm juugin' up pounds, I'm breakin' down midget
I got the birds, pigeons
They know who the fuck run the city (Nawfside!)
I might pull up with that chopper and extensions
I just let it off, I empty about 50
Mama said, "Quavo don't spend all your Benjis"
Told mama, "I'm sorry, pockets on infinity"
You can ask around, really hit them juugs for the fuckin' pound
Next time you see me, better not ask me for no money now
Never went to school, never thought about Clark or Morris Brown
'Til I took your bitch, drop her off right there by Morris Brown
Used to cook up bricks 'til I turned that shit to an extra now
I got the magic stick, feelin' like Criss Angel, bitch
I disappear bricks
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Offset]
17 stackin' and countin', 18 I ran from the bounty
You niggas is softer than Bounty
, my nigga got 15, free Ronny
Check out my bio, plenty felonies, known for countin' up broccoli
Known for stackin' up celery, you niggas ain't even a vet to me
'Member the days? Run in your house like a raid
Young nigga tryna get paid
Pistol to his face, give him a shave
Never selfish, all the money I gave
Never change, all the money I make
1 baby, all these bitches I laid
2 guns, nigga, never afraid
Migos the army I'm never gon' trade
Set-Set
 hit a 20 band juug
He helped the hood, everybody was good
I'm white like a tiger and I got the wood
My niggas on go like Nike, they gon' do it
These niggas wonderin', like how did we do it?
Water diamonds on my neck look like fluid
I'm from the Zone 3 if you niggas ain't knew it
I'm throwin' up the north cause that is my hood
Locked up, mama couldn't get me out
Called my nigga Bookie, he got me out
KK got my back, ain't no doubt
Player made, free my bro, let him out
This shit is crazy, shout out mama house
Don't come to my trap and you unannounced
21 Challenger mounted up
Doin' phones, fucked your credit up
When you a boss they gon' cherish yah
Investigations, I didn't tell 'em nothin'
December 25th, on the run
I didn't know if I was comin' home
19, I was on my own
My grandma died, cancer on her bones
I ran in houses just to buy some Foams
You can hear the pain in my voice on my songs
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
13 I got my first halftime
14, broke in the club for an Alpine
15 I got my first Glock 9
It was rusty but it still'd bust a nigga
I was lil' nephew, they wasn't gon' touch a nigga
If I did, my uncles'll bust a nigga
Migo gang, they couldn't fuck with a nigga
Started beefin' with some sucka niggas
Belushi's right there up on Club Drive
It's was y'all side versus Nawfside
Knocked a couple niggas out a couple times
Got in shootouts with niggas a hundred times
Come to your party, we fuckin' it up
Young niggas, we never gave a fuck
Young niggas, 10, 12, 13, on go with a finger point
A lot of squads start poppin' up
Screamin' shit that we ain't heard of
Migos pull up at your residence
Here comes the issue, "it wasn't us, bruh"
We know you flexin', got the information
So you still gon' get hit with the uppercut
Beat a nigga to a puddle, nigga snitchin'
Now we runnin' from the task force
Niggas was kickin' in doors, takin' flat screens and all the gold
Never got it and I sat on it, nigga, everything I got was sold
Apple Mac, juugin' laptops
Knock in your door, take your lil' brother's Xbox
Migo Jerz stand around the curb
Used to match up in the hotbox
Hit a juug for some True Religions
And some Robin Denims in a public community
My brother's keepers, Migo we got unity
[?] at the park right on Harrington
To the bando, you see niggas gamblin'
Hit a kick door my niggas be ramblin'
I got a bag on my back like I'm 
Santa Claus
Finnesse a nigga, pop [?] up in Panama

Enter the Fisker, I'm doing 250, I'm praying I don't get a ticket
Yes I'm a Migo, but I don't wear Dickies, I'll rather put on True Religion

Ask P, ask me
Northside Migo gang OG
Ridin' round, deuces on a damn Audi
Before I had a deal, young nigga copped it
Them dubs, them fifties, them hundreds, my trap always bunkin' you niggas is funny

Taking them trips making them flip

He told me bout the dirty world and fucked up industry
These niggas they don't love you and they want you for your currency
So I go buy a pint of lean
I'm thinking bout moving to Canada but I know they 'gon be still watching me
I know that they're after me, but I won't let them capture me
And everyday, and every night, I pray they won't shackle me!

Lost my daddy, young nigga I was only four

Taking all this pressure so I had to pull a kick door
I understand I have committed a sin
Double Dee said keep going hard on these fuck niggas, gotta know we 'gon win
So I'm sitting in my room reading the Bible
Skip wiping down a dirty rifle
Never know when it's your last supper nigga, so you gotta keep you some disciples, gone!

Had to stay down with my hustle now I'm filthy rich
This that chicken talk dog, old Gucci shit
Caught him with a hundred bricks

Moved her out to the suburbs, baby boy done growed up
Quarter milly in all hundreds in front of the plug when I showed up
He tried to sneak a couple blue dream on me

Fuck you doing nigga, slow up
Before me and a couple side Memphis niggas come stick you and your ho up

Momma told me, "Son, you gon be the greatest
And you know that you gon always have haters."

No limit money nigga like I signed with Percy Miller
Whipping it, whipping that Hitler then hop in that Fisker

Wanna see a nigga locked up or dead
Straight up out the county, straight to the fortune
Remember back in the day broke on the porches
Smokin gas,
 
sipping mud,
 driving in them Porsches

Thousand dollars pair Giuseppes, no more rocking Jordans
 Rolex for my son, Jordan

Ever since day 1, had to juug some

It was 2 years ago, it feel like it was yesterday
 around my house looking for a case
Turning on the

Turn myself in cause I know my 
 beat the case
Then we dropped Bando, hoes go loco
How dare a nigga ever disrespect the Migos
Could see that hater look in the eyes, the way we hit em by surprise
Cause we blowing up like inner tube tires
Now look at my life rocking the ice, rocking the mic
Now my hoes a different color, looking like Mike & Ikes
(Versace!) Damn right I changed my life
I hope I motivated young niggas to get their money right
Now this is for the people let em know that we some young rich niggas
Now this is for the people let em know that we got way more than one hit single

Know that my wristwatch is sloppy
Now they want a double dutch in my pockets
Tell me one thing, is she 'bout it? Girl is you 'bout it?
Gotta know before we let you tip toe and run through the lobby
But the little bitty told me sloppy toppy was a hobby
So she got me sloppy toppy like the sloppy toppy Goddess
Over the garden, over the garden, 
oh what a goddess
On my 
province
, we don't do massages, 
just "ménages"
She like to talk shit when we fuck, after she claims she forgot it
She don't tap out, no tap out, she rather just black out
Then we take trips to her trap house
We been pullin' them stacks out
Call over your friends, bend over, they poppin' for bands
Can't stop if I can, 
no I do not do beer cans, fuck is this a frat house?
[Bridge: Travis Scott & Quavo]
I know that she got it, Quavo know that she got it
I know that she got it, I know that she got it, I know that she got it
[Verse 3: Quavo]
I pull up and pick her up, get her bruh
I know that she bad
And I know that the head is so good when she got around
I know that we call her the sloppy toppy
My pockets so sloppy
I pull out the whopper, the chopper
Just know that's who shot ya
Me, pull up in that 'Rari I don't have a key
She hop in the whip, disappear like a genie
[Verse 4: Takeoff]
She got the sloppy toppy, bitches want my broccoli
She after my money, Monopoly
Them twitter bitches wanna follow me
I make 'em swallow me then kick 'em off of my property
Paparazzi keep on stalkin' me
Feel like the Federali's keep on watchin' me
Worth 100 mil, niggas can't talk to me
Get sloppy toppy but you givin' currency
I make your bitch work for me, she at the Doubletree
Chopping strong, OG gas bags of that Hercules
I'm whipping the top off the Audi, do surgery
Red on the bottom, my shoes it's a murder scene
I don't want your bitch she a natnat
Pull up in the Audi, it's a hatchback
Kickin', pimpin' and I'm luxury livin'
Makin' it disappear, I'm a magician
[Hook: Quavo]
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it, I know that she got it, I know that she got it
Know that the bad bitch got it
Know that she got it, I know that she got it, I know that she got it
[Verse 5: PeeWee Longway]
Sloppy in the wrist and all my pockets
Come here lil bitch, I want sloppy toppy
Butt naked, fuckin' in Balenciaga
Her pussy wet, I call it Fiji water
I know she got it, I'ma beat it for her
Then I dismiss the bitch and ignore her
They know I got it, I'm at the top floor
Blue Benjamins on me, no dubs
Duffle bag filled up like I'm Money Mayweather
Boogers in my Rollie, Pikachu yellow
Pick a shoe, Balenci, Maison Margiela
Pick a big bezel, which bezel is better?
My jeweler know I got big cheddar
Double Lambo, double parking wherever
Double R ghost jump out with an umbrella
Come with me, we take off like space shuttles
Longway, Longway
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Offset]
Sloppy toppy in the Maserati
She gone get on top me, ride me like a Harley
I don't fuck with the molly, look at her body
She a hottie like a bag of Takis
Beat the pussy like I'm Pacquiao
Squeeze the nipples like you milk a cow
Pull up in the car that she can't pronounce
Dick in her mouth, you'd think she got a root canal
30 thousand for her Birkin
Fat booty, shawty perfect
She gag on the dick and she burpin'
She swallow my kids like a slurpee
Good brains, she nerdy
I'm wonderin' what is her purpose
When I get around her I get nervous
Little momma, she clean like detergent

Expensive watches everybody watchin'
And it ain't really nothing to a boss
Get lost
[ Hook: Quavo ]
[ Verse 3: Takeoff ]
My momma she told me go get it the benji

Trapping in Memphis but im no Grizzly
Run up on me you coming up missing

I fly cross the city to see ass and titties
Trying to run tricks on me

Millis they all in my ceiling
The leaches still washing my dishes
Santa still coming on christmas
Callin' up Kevin, he open the gate

Foreign bitch, she super bad, she eating calamari
All I count is bands, all I see is racks
Make a check, I fuck it, then I make it back
Shawty, she be calling me, but I don’t call her back
Earrings cost a rack, I just bought a watch

Laughing with money
Taking trips across the country!
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Takeoff]
On my way to Costa Rica I just left for Argentina
Hurricane Katrina will somebody please call FEMA

My top drop blunt hit a rhyme with a heater

Well respected in the hood like my momma was a reaper
Pull up in that Lotus Focus might mistake me for a creature
I done taught so many lessons they call me ol' Takeoff the Teacher
[Hook]

If I see the police, grab my chips and I dip
Snapping my fingers, we fillin' arenas I flip up the Hannah Montana in real
I feel like that Keyshia Ka'oir, that double AK-47's, they aim at your lip
Versace, Givenchy, this shit is ridiculous
SHABBA!
[Verse 5 : Busta Rhymes]
Look, nigga, get it straight, you could never fuck with my clique, boy

Niggas see me shinin' 'til he's sick, sick, sick
Any bitch really want Islam dick, boy

Kill 'em 'til they say a nigga triflin' out here
And you can let 'em talk, you know who the nicest out here
Vroom, vroom, vroom! Bite dust pussy
Better get low when yu hear de shot buss, pussy
Every time I come here, know I body niggas fully

And I'm bigger than your shorty though her pussy kinda bushy
Fuckin' on the low, 
Versace logo on the hoodie
Airhorn blow, my nigga, bwam bwam bwam
Let it go, you already know what's really goodie
Killin' shit like I'm some kind of cancer
Bag your bitch, now she my private dancer
I don't understand why niggas feel like they have to ask who the god is
When you know what's the answer
Chokehold shit 'til they be callin' me strangler
Hundred million dollars, safe behind the plasma
Proper with it, 'til he spread the propaganda
And when I TEC talk, can we pop your man up
On my Sha-Shabba Ranks
On my Sha-Shabba Ranks
Nigga, gettin' so much money
It's like I just robbed a bank, nigga

[Chorus: Quavo]
When the plane come down in your town
And we only in town for three days
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
She say I always got somewhere to stay, stay, stay
Always got somewhere to stay
No matter how far I go, she always hold me down
That's why everywhere I go I always save a plane
[Verse 1: Quavo]
I told you once I ain't gon tell you twice
Better back off my bitch young nigga or you might lose your life
Just me and her ridin round in my two-seater
[?]
Remember the time the police they lock me up and you 
buying
 me out
Remember that time they wanted you to talk and you close your mouth
That's why I fuck with you, I really can’t say I love you
But I do really fuck with you, like everything that you do and she know
[Chorus: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Dirty Dave]
Rap game that's Birmingham, Alabama, Savannah, Atlanta
Any city any place
No matter where I go in the world
I got a chick to keep a nigga straight
When I call lil mama she come through
Sacks full of cash we run through
Fuck all day, fuck all night
Where ever the fuck we want to
I enjoy all the time that we spend, but it never seems to last
Now I gotta get back to the cash
[Chorus: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Offset]
No matter how far I go, lil mama she coming to get me
She do what she gotta do, she independent
I trust her, but I can’t love her
She know why young nigga a hustler
Got a young nigga's back when I’m trouble
Got the body of a goddess, Brazilian mixed with Scottish
She exotic, she come from a island
I can trust her in the trap, she ain’t gon steal my dope
If the feds kick the door I know lil mama won’t fold
[Chorus: Quavo]


[Produced By Murda]
[Hook – Quavo]
Dope on the scale, man you never seen it
Hundred band juug, no you never hit it
You never been down the road to riches
This the story I tell so you pay attention
Cold turkey, yeah we had to eat it
So I take the pot and fucking beat it
You never been down the road to riches
Take your pen and your pad cause you gonna need it
Trap money, me and my dogs spend it
Your bitch, me and my dogs hit it
Drop the head on the Bentley then fall in it
When we dropped Versace, then y’all did it
They hate that we came from the Northside
Then linked in the city, got mob ties
They hate that we came in with plenty jewels
Young nigga just dabbin' first day of school
[Verse 1 – Quavo]
Remember the days with the pocket rockets
Turned the bando to a fucking hot pocket
It’s a million dollars in the corner pocket
I just share the rock like I’m John Stockton
African diamonds, Olajuwon, Houston Rockets
My niggas they got 'stendos on their guns, they go up out it
Ain’t no need to talk about it
Megaton trucks, it don’t weigh enough
Had to take out the plug, he was switching up
You mad cause your label do finger fucks
QC the label got mega bucks
Gas off in the back of the spinner bus
Say that you trapping, really you got touch and bust
This is the life of the Hefty bags
You know that them ounces don’t weigh enough
[Hook]
[Verse 2 – Takeoff]
I came a long way from dropping the fishes
Finessing the plug for his riches
Wake up in the morning, I go grab the spatula
Walk in the kitchen and whip me a chicken
Her wrist is a Masi, my neck is a Bentley
Blue Benjamins that can pay your tuition
Lupe said that Activis been discontinued
Double cup, a nigga still be sipping
Got a plug out in Mississippi
Wrap it up, ship it to Finland
I trap out the bando, don’t trap out the trap house
And whatever you with, we with it
Came a long way from that midget
Money taller than a midget
I keep the mac like a midget
Mama we made us a milli, we did it
Fuck the negativity, fuck the critics
[Hook]
[Verse 3 – Offset]
They hate that that money start coming
And I be too fresh, I call it double mints
I was on the block, you was on punishment
Giuseppe stepping, and my diamonds they compliments
QC my label, and that’s my establishment
Supercharge my Bentley, I call it Clark Kent
Me and my niggas spread the butter, margarine
Marvin the Martian, got Raris, I cut off the engines
Now park it
You can catch a bullet in your carcass
100 band juug, and you wasn’t a part
I took the plug off and we had a departure
You telling a story bout me, I’m the author
These bitches be choosing, they digging my posture
Whipping babies, I’m not talking bout toddlers
Similac in on these baby bottles
Little babies get stepped on they call me stepfather
[Hook]


[Hook: Quavo]
Everybody been through it
Everybody used to it
But ain’t nobody new to it
We all gone go through it
And that’s the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
Call it the struggle
Struggle, struggle, struggle
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Got to survive, the struggle
I had to get my money cause I ain’t have no muscle
My squad gon ride that’s because I trust em
If he want to die, know my squad gon bust him
If they ain’t with us then my nigga fuck em
It’s a struggle in my hood, blue Benjamins, I touch em
RIP to Mike Brown
, I heard my nigga fuck with us
Middle finger to the police dare them niggas fuck with us
 (Fuck 12!)
I got all these chains, I’m representing slavery
Only listen to my god and mama, that’s who made me
When my brother [?] called my phone, that shit was crazy
RIP my brother Pistol Pete, let em know we made it
Mama told me that she can’t visit me in the pen
She want to break me out and I can’t see her going in
I swear to god you might ain't seen it
But if you been through the struggle I know you feel this
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
See the struggle is a motherfucker
Nigga tryna hit me for my chain, but I ain’t gon let him touch it
Go to any state, walk through your hood and I ain’t got to tuck em
Swear to god if you touch my brother I ain’t gon hesitate to bust ya
Niggas see you getting money, plotting, tryna take it from ya
It’ll hurt you if you know your right hand man, he telling on you
Break down me a Backwood, rolling me a blunt of marijuana
OutKast in my Backwood, young nigga smoking on Stankonia
Remember plugging up that George Foreman
Early in the morning eat leftovers
I had to warm it, now a young nigga eat steak and shrimp and Benihanas
I remember ten piece chicken nuggets from McDonalds
I remember mama said get up, go get that money
Stand solid, never let another nigga take it from you
I told you mama, now you got that mansion that you wanted
I came a long way from renting the Audi, now I own it
Rest in peace [?] and Pistol Pete, the top is lonely
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Offset]
First free my brothers, we used to build the mansions in the house with covers
He used to beat me, told me nigga get some muscle
If you can’t beat em then you gonna have to bust em
It was a struggle, grandma dead, man I really wish I could hug her
Migo gang la familia, so fuck the other
I told my mama I got her back when I lost my brother
Locked up for a strap said I wasn’t going back and I still got in trouble
If you got the sack then my niggas kidnap, call my niggas, they gutter
Packing the dope, we kickin' in your door, we looking for the gold
Keep the forties on my hip, the heater because the world is so cold
Get the money, fuck the bitches, nigga that’s the number one goal
If a nigga want a pull up then a nigga got to be bold
Five racks, hit him with the chopper, nigga you got to go
You niggas is hoes when the pistol shows, you getting exposed
Givenchy my toe, I came out that bowl, I lived on the stove
[Hook: Quavo]

Now lay me down to sleep, pray the lord my soul to keep
Hundred band juugs, I did a week

Some niggas they go move the weight
Some niggas they just got make it shake
My life is a movie, my niggas they gooning
Put 100 bands in their face, my nigga baffooning
That mean they go get it, the money, the power, respect

And I keep the seven, I play with the Eagles
The water so cold, y’all finna turn fold
Like you at the top just to get to the gold
I’m draped up in gold, like a pharaoh
I ride the phantom, like I’m a ghost
Pull out the MCM bag, got faces
Ride in the Bentley, they said I wouldn’t make it
My diamonds are Asian, I’m selling Caucasian
Walk on the block, the block is Cajun

I don't know why the lord save me
I had to get rid of them babies

My momma she told me I made it, Im tired of my family slavin
Daddy was a hospital patient, next thing you know he couldn't make it
I put my head down I ain't cry, cuz then I ain't know what death mean
Then a when a nigga growed up I ain't have my daddy on the scene
So a nigga had to lend to his momma, So a nigga had to go chase commas
Use to eat dollar menu at mcdonalds, now I'm eating big plates at
Benihanas, gone
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Que]
Its first thang I do when I wake up
I'm thanking the lord stay prayed up
Its hard out here for a young nigga
If you ain't got heart you get ate up
Just tryin to maintain and stay out that cell without breakin the law
But its hard as hell
, 
the man above for showing me love
Im taking them trips to Beverly Hills, runnin through hoes
And counting them M's, living life high like Invader Zim
Live for today and pray for the next, I only see money
G's on my specs
, 
I sin everday just to get this success
I want it for me, yall want it to flex
The difference between us its clear as it gets
Niggas be fake so I show no respect
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I don't know why the lord save me
All the time I disobey him
You would think I would be in dem cages
So every day I wake and thank him
From kickin dem doors sellin them babies
To walkin through Jeff for a price of a baby
I swear its a blessing I never regret it
This shit gets so hetic a nigga start stressing
The kush ain't helpin', lookin' at my Smith & Wesson
Looking for them vegetarians I'm taking yo lettuce and celery
I'm posted on sunset in Beverly Hills my niggas they do this for reals
I'm drinking the Act out the seal got niggas waiting for they appeal

[Chorus: Cinco]
Quavo, Young Rich Nigga, Young Rich Nigga

All the foreign women, all the foreign women
I was in disguise, in disguise
Backseat of the Bentley, backseat of the Bentley
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Speaking of back seats, do you remember the back seats (remember)
Remember the days when 
Will Mac
 was driving, young Quavo was in the back seat (ugh!)
Running from 12s, on the back street! Yes he right behind but theres no catching me(No!)
It’s late at night, and I pray to God, I want a new Rari, tell him I’m sorry for my sins (sorry!)
New beginningin, (beginningin), all my team winningin, (winningin)
Have you ever played with the Falcons,  catch him

Cook a brick when a nigga get bored (brick!), chop it down like a samurai sword (chop it down)
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Offset]
Back seat of the police car, waking up in the morning seeing bars (prison!)
Momma told me what the fuck you gon’ do, you gon’ stay being broke or you take off tomorrow?
Now I pull up Bentley all my cars,  Now that I’m rich nigga

And I’m rolling up Keisha, gon live it up, what I’m rollin up, in a ‘gar
Young rich nigga came a long way,(long way) everybody said we wouldn’t make it (we wouldn’t make it)
I’m the same nigga trappin out the vaca, and when I pull up you should see the haters faces (look at em)

Trapping and capping, they calling me 
Rayful

[Bridge]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]

Man that bitch ain’t worth a fuckin penny (ugh ugh), she wanna shopping spree, she want the paparazzi
Want to  be spend all my broccoli at Lenox, little bitch you tripping – can’t get my blue Benjamin’s
I’m sorry if I did offended you, I don’t want no relationship – I’m through with you
You can keep all of your Louboutin tennis shoes, all that jewelry, those things are material (those things ain't nothing)
Cause those 15 bitches on my telephone, want to go to my top floor condo 
in Rome
 (top floor condo)
Sneaking and geeking -- sucking less them leaches, lobby runned up with some Puerto Ricans and they freaky
She suck me all night till I sleep
, Whipping up a brick a nigga drinking Easter Pink
Like you love a nigga bitches they be  shopping overseas,                   I can take a nonbeliever and I make that bitch believe
Does she cook it, does she flip it right? That bitch could live with me
If she can stand on the block with the brick and run from the Police
She ain’t got no problem bringing back the product to me
Whip a chicken in the kitchen I send that bitch in the streets.  (Whipping it!)
[Chorus]

Fuck a nigga's feelings, bitch I'm rich, I don't give a damn

Trapping and trapping it turned into rapping
I don't even know how it happened
The money is coming in an orderly fashion

Flipping the work wit' no spatula
Pull up in 'Rarri, I'm crawling tarantula

I promise they'll damage ya
Migo gang, pull up flexin' 30 chains
Lamb no brains, got it off of cocaine
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
How does it feel to be broke?

[Verse 1: Offset]
The work, it do magic like Criss Angel

So many chains on my neck, they get 
tangled
I'm in Atlanta sipping Texas Ranger

Mystikal 45, that bitch come with danger
So many bitches they callin' me gigolo

Duffle on my back for Lucifer
Jumping and capping out these cubicals
Never made 
honor roll
I'm in the top and you falling like dominos
[Verse 2: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]

Racks on me like I'm playing tennis
Hundred thousand on my new Bentley
Spend a hundred thousand on my friend bitch
Gold like I'm (?), shining

I’m looking for drops to change the climax
No comprendo if you ain't about peso
Got the clay and dough (?), call it Clay-Doh

Speaking of the yayo, Young Guapo Young Guapo he all about peso

You speaking about 
Christian

I'm a boss like Rozay
, Young Guapo got niggas on the payroll
We used to it, not new to it, just stacking out the paper
Wen't from standing on the block,  to smoking OG in skyscraper (top floor condo)
My niggas got bean, no lasers
Cavalli my jeans, ten chains on with a Versace blazer
[Verse 4: Peewee Longway]
(Longway, bitch)
Longway reloaded, blood on my blue Benjamin like a Crip (?), trap will blow his out
Balenci' Givenchy, I trap it down
Half naked bitches give me bubble bath, Longway Nino Brown
Put the foot in the cage just to break a pound
Fiend and forks, they gon' watch you
Sneakin' N Geekin' in 
Sugar Hill

[Intro: Ca$h Out]
I'm talking trap shit
From now on, if you ain't been in that booth
I don't wanna do a song with you
Trap shit, aye
[Hook: Ca$h Out]
I roll up my weed, I'm smokin' that pound
I'm up in the boat, I think it's a drought
The car should pull out, the rest should pull out
What else can I say? I love the trap house
I love the trap house (x4)
The car should pull out, the rest should pull out
What else can I say? I love the trap house
[Verse 1: Ca$h Out]
I'm up in the boat, I'm whippin' a fo'
I'm whippin' a nine, the Rollie my time, no wastin' my time
I'm doing my time if I do the crime, these niggas gon' tell
I said these niggas gon' tell, they ain't got no bail, these niggas is hell
I love it, I love it like August Alsina
, I'm whippin' a Beamer
These niggas, they plottin', these niggas, they schemin', [?]
Made everybody say "Woo!"
I'm up in the boat with Gambino, they say "Woo!"
Her pussy got a little tang so I say "Wu!"
Heh, heh, heh, don't crack me up
Money, you know I stacked it up
Six months then I packed it up, trap rules
Carry so much weight, shit, I gotta make the news
I love the trap house
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Quavo]
What can I say? I love the bando, you don't need to be talking
What can I say? The bando got a nigga Giuseppe-walking
Papi know that I'mma shoot
If you try to take a deuce, lean or boot
She a bad bitch but I make her cook, now she mad at me
She jingalin' them pockets out a papi
It ain't a trap house, you ain't got a shooter at the door
Hell nah, it ain't no trap house, you ain't got a fork and a bowl
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I can't get enough of the egg beater
Got my hand in the bowl whippin' jungle fever
Walk in my trap house, I'm selling that Justin Bieber
Trap nigga, using my strap for a heater
My diamonds on cold, they callin' me 
Freezer
You pussy nigga, they call you 
Vegeta
A hundred thousand for a feature
Fifty thousand for a picture
Back then was I was a lil' nigga
Gettin' in trouble, had to see the preacher
Mama told me read the scripture
"Put God first and you'll be a rich nigga"
Whippin' and whippin' and whippin' and whippin' that pot
(Whippin' it, whippin' it, whippin' it) Till my arms fall off
Lot of ratchets, pacer active, money machine how I'm coppin' it
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Offset]
I love the trap house, got a brick on my couch
Got a K on my couch, got yo' bitch in my house
I built the empire, started with a ounce
Stretching the nine cause every ground counts
Trap out the bando, just like I'm Rambo
It's just surveillance when I change the channel
Trappin' and cappin' bought me a new Phantom
I paid my dues, I dropped outta school
They say I'm a fool, I'm whippin' the deuce
I never fold cause I don't have a clue
Touch down on a pussy like dog food
Distributing work with intentions
I'm the teacher, yo' bitch in detention
Fifty bricks all outta quantity
Controllin' the flour, good quality
(Woop woop) There go 12!
Go in the house, we can't go to jail!
No T.I., I'm on a paper trail
Enchilada for sale like Taco Bell
Indian, trap with the cartel
Cook in the kitchen, Offset a chef
My fork swim in water like Michael Phelps
I made a million in the trap with no help!
[Hook]


[Hook x2: Quavo]
Cash out on a half a boat, then I hit the mall
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
Trap life lil' nigga, you might not live this life I'm talking bout
The rap life and trap life, me and you can swap it out
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Man I'm tired of selling bricks
Gotta [?] hit licks
Can't wait till I sign that deal
The trap life, I'll give it up quick
Listen up, nigga speaking real shit
Cause it ain't all what it seems
You can have it all at one time, then end up losing everything
And I put that shit on my mom
Imma make it out of the slums
Imma get [?] in a mansion, in a penthouse, living lavish
We at the top floor of the condo
We ain't never got to worry about the popo
We eating on shrimp and gumbo
We smoking on blunts, they jumbo
I got J's at the front door
I serve them up with that combo
Got birds flying like Dumbo but I keep a 9 like Rondo
I locked the game, I got the code
Cash coming fast that pronto
Making plays, Tony Romo
Two bad bitches, they homo
[Hook x2]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Trap game risky but its so easy to flip them fishes
Popeyes, [?] chicken with them biscuits
Fuck an iPhone, trapping off a Tracfone
Give the Feds [?], they can't even track the phone
[?]
Ride through the city in a coupe [?]
Overseas with Muhammad [?]
Got a date with the money and the kush is my cologne
Sippin on lean out 2 styrofoam
I finesse a nigga for that cash in the red zone
You ain't never ever live the trap life nigga
You don't know nothing bout the rap life nigga
Hell nah I don't want to [?] it out with you
Cause you don't even know what you taking bout nigga
I don't know you but I know your [?]
But a nigga never ever got gwap with you nigga
You ain't got cash, you ain't never ever sold drugs
You ain't never chop it up with the plug
You ain't never roll down 85 with a 100 birds in a Lamborghini truck
When I'm filthy rich thats when I'll give this trap shit up
[Hook x2]


[Hook: Quavo]

It'll tell you I'm trappin' and rappin' in Dago
Thumb through the pesos with my 'migo Quavo
Overnight shipments, I don't need a layover
I get my pimpin', I told 'em the wait over
Take all my riches and bend yo' man bay over
Rich got ridiculous, whoopin' the coyola
I fucked yo' bitch and I gave her a makeover
Quality Control, the game is in takeover
Trappa turned rappa, trappa turned rappa
Break down and we make it clap like magnolia
Trappa turned rappa, trappa turned rappa
Don't get it confused not your average rapper, I get you wrapped up and kidnapped
I pity the fool for you industry fools, fuck nigga I C's in the trap
Run circles on niggas, I gone by two laps
Got bands in my pants, got yo' bitch out my lap
A quick understanding, I'm still in the trap with them young niggas like Rambo pimp at yo' cat
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
Offset
Trappin' and rappin', I made that shit happen
Bustin' a brick, now my knuckles is ashy
Either trappin' or rappin', don't matter it's lavish

Got a 100 band juuggin', I grab it

All these damn karats, I look like a rabbit, this dirty ass money, I need me a record
Yo' turn up Offset, I say he be slappin'

Im in Orlando and I'm trappin' that magic
I juugg the finesse my way up to the top
I'm so proud of myself, Rolex with the clear rocks
Italian chinchilla made from a fox
Red dot on his body, he got chicken pox
The judge tried to sentence him, how the hell he worth a million?
My plug is an immigrant, bitches Brazilian
You niggas imposters, my money colossus
Neighbourhood crips and they killin' on Slauson
The white bricks my son and the tan is my daughter
Trappa turned rappa, livin' like Sean Carter
Cold heart specs on my face look like Arthur
I only fuck bitches that look like Ms Parker


[Verse 1: Drake]
Han't heard records on my demo?
Did y'all boys not get the memo?
I do not stay at the Intercontinental
And anything I got is not a rental

Figured out this shit is simple
My stock been going up like a crescendo
A bunch of handshakes from the fakes
But nigga, I do not wanna be friends though
I told y'all mu'fuckas
Man, this shit is not a love song
This a "fuck-a-stripper-on-the-mink-rug" song
This a "fuck-them-boys, forever-hold-a-grudge" song
"Pop-some-fucking-champagne-in-the-tub" song
Nigga, "just-because" song
Damn

Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy
Young nigga won trappin' a grammy, I-I want a Grammy

We came from juug in the Impala to smashin' them models
We independent, we don't need none of your major dollars
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Flippin' and whippin' and spinnin' the dope
, 
I'm hittin' the door

And when I touchdown I'll hop in a Zonda
Smokin' on good marijuana in Mexico, call that quintana
Tryna fuck me a Rihanna

[Verse 4: Offset]
Sellin' a Grammy like Tony (Montana!), now I want Grammy's and ceremonies

Always gettin' trophies and recreation, 
Q.C. the label
, the solid foundation
Sittin' at home I was contemplating, changing and switch up my situation
Tryna see the bigger picture,

No it ain't no money issue, grant all my momma's wishes
Watchin' her son on the channel

[Hook: Quavo]
Pull up and I got a lot of work all on the freeway
What nigga you know making M&M's on a Tuesday
Migo Gang, Hustle Gang, known to get it hustle everythang
Migo Gang, Hustle Gang, known to get it hustle everythang
Go out and hustle if you want the muscle man with the trouble
How many times I pull up with the chopper
Nigga they don't want trouble
Trouble, fuck nigga they don't want trouble
How many times I pull up with the chopper
Fuck nigga they don't want no trouble
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Mama told me 'Quavo stop trappin'
I like kicking doors and taking gold I gotta have it
Young nigga battled for a hustle mentalities
On the northside I was trapping, capping
Made a million dollars independent, I seen it
Pockets on Mondo Burger, call me Kenan
Then I fucked your ho, now she can see me
Giving me a massage, I think she orthopedic
Who want the problem, you don't want no trouble
We pull up and solve 'em
Shout out my driver, he get a million on the highway
Got the work in exhaustion
Gotta stay cautious, not taking no losses, Migos young bosses
I think I'm getting nauseous
Looking at my diamonds, looking like they frosted
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
As an adolescent I was up in trouble
Telling on your brother, working with the undercover
Never listen to a nigga, 
never listened to my mother
BAH CLAH CLAH,
 
let it burn just like it's Usher
Got the 40, call me Michael Finley, 50 bricks up in the fender
Hit the nigga with the semi
Hit the witness, we don't get a sentence
Migo the army, Young Offset lieutenant
AK-47 tall as a midget
Migos on top of you niggas like we is the gunner
Focusing on my grind, I do it for my brother
My niggas keep a Magnum, I ain't talking about a rubber
You don't want to go to war, I ain't talking about a tugs
Niggas be swimming, drowning up in the blood puddle (Pussy!)
Put a nigga up under the ground, call him Harriet Tubman
You reek and the stink of the bullet make him smell musty
You say you a shooter but why the hell your bullets rusty
[Hook]
[Verse 3: T.I]
My niggas bust guns like Chicago
And my money stack as tall as the sky go
And yeah my bitch you couldn't get unless you give her away
And any bitch that you with ain't shit, no shit, dig it
Anybody fucking with me know what it is
That shit that you be talking about we did it for real
I told my nigga Doe B Imma get him a mill
He died in December and we getting it still
Hopping out Ferrari with a pocket full of money
.40 in my trunk, bust down a couple hundred
Gambling on the pool table lost me a couple hundred
Then I struck a dice game and tripled my money
Lames that belong on the wall of shame
Well you can check my stats, I'm in the hall of fame
Bitch nigga better miss me with all the games
Before I pull the chopper, decorate the wall with brains
And I ain't fucking round with it
Last 13 years he ain't fucked around, did he?
Even as a young nigga, bossing up around Diddy
Fighting with the bouncer, walking out of Magic City
Going over to The Cheetah pocket full of Velveeta
Hear the name through the speakers, what it do my nigga?
Hustle Gang is the name, we the bankroll mob
Get big bankroll is what we do my nigga, aye!

Smoking loud ass gas, make a nigga choke
And I know you smoking mid, I see that barrel smoke
Take your bitch to the mall, she walking out with Coach
Now I got her running plays like I am the coach
Hang them on a rope, soldiers trained to go
All my niggas don't move till I say so
Niggas trapping out a mansion and a Lambo
Can't see the troops cause they wearing camo
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Don't act like you don't know

In the kitchen with the stove [?]
[?]
Got the hood saying 'Jumping out the bando'
Niggas mad acting like they don't know
Bill G put terror in your squad
And I walk around pockets on Fat Joe
Walk around with the deuce deuce
Smoking on fat ass blunts Bruce Bruce
Riding in the truck with no motherfucking roof
And it got 2 doors would've thought it was a coupe
Hit the gas in my [?]
Hit hard like a nigga smoking Kimbo
And when I sip the lean, lean low like a nigga playing limbo
Pull up in a drop top lambo
All the kids they scream out 'Bingo'
That bitch who I could afford her [?] new world order
[Hook]


[Hook: Quavo]
Young rich nigga feel like Bill Gates

Pull up in that Oakland Raider Drop Audi
Then I poof be gone like Houdini driving
Thats the plug, drop the bricks, circumcise 'em
Then I hit the pot with the pile driver
[Hook 2] x2
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Young Rich Nigga, I call the plug, I'm finessing
I'm strapped up with the smith and wesson, I'm taking yo blessings
Smoking a Michael Vick 7, preach to these niggas like reverends
No Jason and Freddy, I keep the Machete
I'm taking a trip to Quebec to go pick up that check
Nigga no UPS but he mail it, right that bitch up and I scale it
Stand on the block and i sale it, selling more dope than them niggas in 
Belly
The niggas after me, I'm makaveli
She popping the molly, she rollin' like kelly, she sweating
She can't stop touching and talking and feeling on me
All this jewelry on me, it's kinda hard to see
Migo Gang Ent!
[Hook 2]


[Verse 1 - Quavo]
I met this bitch the other day
She said pay me before you talk to me
I asked her why is that?
She said boy do you think this pussy free
Damn, I thought she was innocent
I still paid for it and hit it, quit it
I still been fucking with her about 6 months
You know a young nigga can’t hit it and quit it
Damn, can I get a witness?
Know I’m not the only one who did this
Your friends is all in our business
Quit her then come back like Frisbee
Ain’t gon lie, I think I’m addicted
And my main girl keeps tripping
Don’t think I’d like to get rid of it
My side ho taking my benjamins
[Hook – Quavo]
She got that wet wet, wet wet
Splash, splash, wet wet (water, water)
Spending all my money on that wet wet
And she might leave you wet, you call her natnat
I ain’t tripping, I’m addicted to that wet wet
She wet!
Wet, wet wet, wet wet, wet wet
God I know she’s wet, wet wet, wet
Wet wet
[Verse 2 – Rich The Kid]
Your bitch getting wet like water, splash
Young nigga walking with the cash
Hit it and quit it, I’m leaving her dripping
Riding round the city with the bricks in the fender
At the Greyberry, laid up with two bitches
She sucked that dick like her teeth missing
That ass so fat but it’s paid for
She can ride that dick like a skateboard
Bank roll, bank roll, young nigga walking with a bank roll
Shooters gon fold, we throw them bands up
In the club, throwing money like Meech, ho
Wet wet, wet wet, shawty really got that wet wet
I’m a young rich nigga, came up from the bottom
Walk around with jewels, no Dipset
[Hook]
[Verse 3 – Takeoff]
I met this bitch, she said she went to school to be an architect
She seen my drop top, CLS and my Corvette, she got wet
She took a breath, I got her number
Soon as I left she shot a text
Said she was feeling my feng shui
And the way that I macho man flex
I put her on molly, she sneaking and geeking
I fucked her, she wet on my Givenchy sheets
Giuseppe steppers or the red bottoms
That’s 1000 dollars each feet
She sucking me up, out of control
Lord have mercy, take my soul
Wet wet, all night
Addicted to her like dirty Sprite
[Hook]


[Hook x2: Quavo]
All the real niggas locked up in prison
Most my niggas robbin' or either killin'
Some my niggas on the block drug dealin'
I just wanna know, what y'all doin'?
[Verse 1: Quavo]
What y'all doin'? What y'all doin'?
Gotta make a difference in your own hood
Feel like Will Smith, I see millions, I'm gonna pursue it
If my momma told me if I came up short it's all good
No I had to tell my mom sorry, I could picture me in that 'Rari
After all the pain that we went through
I don't even wanna rewind it
Free all my niggas went down in the system
Send the Green Dot cause I miss 'em
R.I.P. my nigga Pistol, can't believe the bullet hit him
Sometimes a young nigga might wanna cry
But I can't let you niggas see it
It was in my soul takin' flats and gold
Juugin' round the city for no reason
Juug Season, that's what a young nigga called it, Juug Season
In the jungle, I survived every season
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: Offset]
What are you doin'? You had money, you blew it
You had dreams on the court, didn't have no support
All these niggas they stuck in the system
Police keep killin' my people
Trap on the block with the reefer
Tryin' to count up the monifa
Beating the pot I might sneak her
Used to kick doors for new sneakers
Can't trust no bitch cause the sneakin'
I step out that, shoot through your back call you Ricky
Now I got riches so bitches they miss me
Wanna know what you been doin' all this time
Why you ain't got no money on your mind
Together we stand, we fall apart then we divide
Fuck the police we might start up a riot
This shit is so pitiful, had to pay money for my nigga's funeral
That was my nigga we had so much unity
I got in my heart, he on top and he smilin'
Used to talk about a fuckin' rivalry
What about police that take a bribery?
They don't give a fuck about people in poverty
Don't got no property
This a democracy, no apology
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Some of my niggas on the block right now
Most of my niggas kick doors right now
Run up on a nigga tryna rob, got a 100 round drum right now
Most of my niggas court, judge don't drop the hammer down
No Tony Parker, I came a long way from that starter
I'm thanking God cause I never had to ride that Marta
Now my diamonds flawless, make a nigga nauseous
That nigga fresher than Carlton, tryna fuck on Ms. Parker
Remember wanna be a monster, niggas playin' cops and robbers
Ever since a youngin' I was a problem
I was a leader, never was a follower
I got your ho in my condo, she poppin' it
You niggas bitches, you niggas be gossiping'
If a nigga want it, I'ma go get it
My nigga we break it we split it
We takin' riches cause niggas jumpin' them fences


[Hook - Quavo]
What you doin?
Baby what you doin?
Ferragamo and Versace, I’m gon wrap you up in Louis (LV)
What you doin? Tell me what you doin
On Santa Monica boulevard, I got you Jimmy Choo
What you doin? (What you doin?)
Tell me what you doin? (What you doin?)
Baby what you doin? (c’mon)
Tell me what you doin? (c’mon)
[Verse 1 – Quavo]
Come come, come on, come on, asap, asap, right now, pronto
Got a Lambo parked outside, you ever seen a Lambo ‘fore?
I can take you to go see Gucci, that my CEO
I can take you to birthday bash, you standing in front row
You a star, at least in my eyes
Got an onion booty, want to cry
Taking trips, I can’t Dubai
She fine, check that’s how we fly
Girl, me and you, we’re to tell the world like woah
We draped up in 24 carat gold
1017 we won the super bowl
She hit the lean, she said she in slow mo
Slow mo, slow mo
Hop in the Lambo door (Skkrt Skkrt)
Leggo, leggo leggo
She hit the lean, she said she in slow mo
[Hook]
[Verse 2 – Takeoff]
Key young nigga Versace, princess cut my diamonds
Bally, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Louis, fuck a stylist
We fresher than some trident, flyer than your pilot
I’m sipping on Activis, you sipping Hypnotiq
My bitch is extravagant (she foreign)
My whip exotic, I just threw your hundred in apartment in silence
Your main bitch in my Delta
Lambo fast call it Devin Hester
I’m flexing, call me Sylvester
Stallone, I keep the chrome
I’m on the block, what you need?
I got zone, y’all niggas ain’t getting no money
Macaulay Culkin, you’re home alone
I gave your bitch a molly, she rolling, no stone
Got on Gucci, Louis, Fendi but that gas is my cologne
[Hook]


[Hook - T-Pain]
She give me everything that I want
Everything that I need
And she do everything you don’t know, yes indeed
She made that booty bounce back
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
What you know, what you know
What you, what you, what you know about that
[Verse 1 – K Camp]
What you little niggas know about that
Take you out the picture, yeah I can crop that
She gon get to busting every time a nigga cock back
You know we good together like Pain with a top hat
Oh lord, hold up wait a second, let her get it
Make her scream Camp when I hit it
That girl bad, she gon go monkey on the dick
Pussy heating up, no skillet
[Bridge – K Camp]
Watch her go, go, go, go, go
I love the way you make that clap, oh yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
And yes I know, know, know, know, know
She gon do anything for me
[Hook]
[Verse 2 – Quavo]
What she know bout the trap house?
What you know bout it?
What she know bout whipping chickens?
She don’t know nothing about it
She know that I’m handsome and wealthy
She know that I got proper etiquette
She knowing that if she gon pop it
She gon go shopping down in Beverly
Make a movie in the photo room
Every time we step out, it’s a damn photo shoot
Palm trees out in Malibu
You can do whatever that you want to do
She giving me everything
No Einstein, she got the brain
Don’t fuck with no rachets, don’t fuck with no rats
You niggas is Pinky the brain
[Hook]
[Verse 3 – Offset]
Pop that pussy like it is a rubber band
She know that I like it on hand stands
They watching the Migos like on demand
I can’t be her man and she understand
She know that I’m rich and I’ll treat her like shit
And I switcheroo the clique, I’m giving assists
Speak with a lisp when she suck on the (huh?)
Then I stroke from the back and it’s hurting her
I cannot lie, this bitch is a stallion
From Barbados back up to Los Angeles
Sipping margaritas, smoking on cannabis
Need a wife, lil mama got character
Immaculate, swagger sharper than a dagger
She gonna keep looking, then I’m gon attack her
She said that she really don’t talk to no rappers
I don’t comprehend what you say, I’m a trapper!
[Verse 4 – Takeoff]
What you know about taking trips to meet the plug?
Pick up the payola and bring it right back
If I gave you the spatula [?] the kitchen
Katrina, call FEMA, show you how to whip it
Pull up in the Bentley, red Forgiato
Poking out, looking like lipstick
Lil mama an angel from heaven
A present wrapped up, lil mama she gifted
Wanna ride faster, just sit in that Bentley
She want some diamonds, go shopping at Tiffany’s
Spikes on the Louboutin, made by Christian
When I look at her I get an epiphany
The way that she walk, the way the bitch talk
I think she the baddest bitch a nigga saw
Leaving from the party, head to the love
Your bitch is down, how I catch her, [?]
[Hook]


[Intro: Quavo]
Where were you
Where were you...
[Hook: Quavo]
Where were you when I was whipping it in the kitchen
Where were you when I was jugg finessing midget
Where were you when I was facing time off tickets
They wanna come around
Where were you...
Where were you when I was down and out and I was in the drought
Where were you when mama said she gon' kick me out
Where were you when I was down on my knees ain't had nun
Now I am at the top right now, just look at you
[Verse 1: Quavo]
I swear, I swear I'm gon' make it to the top this year
Where where, where where, when I whip it, when I flip it lil mama you trippin'
Now you going through what I've been going through, bitch you struggling
I know that you hate it, I know that you mad you're getting a dose of your medicine
The day of reckoning, move out of town I recommend
I treated you with proper etiquette
Where were you when I was beatin' the pan?
The Hannah Montana the molly's anthem
Plug in China I have to meet this man
Choppers imported from Kazakhstan
Where were you when the eggbeater was in my hand?
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 2: TakeOff]
I'm at the top right now, hate to see you at the bottom
But you wasn't fucking with me when I was stacking that guala
I call up my shotta I send him the dollars
You sellout rapper at the bottom
The models they watching the niggas they follow
Double G all on my collar
Bitch say she wants red bottoms
Paying tuition for college
Baby just look at me honest
You wasn't fucking with me when I was at Onyx
For money, back then I was boring, hell no
When I hop in my Porsche of course I know
Big ass bank rolls won't fold
Where were you when I was trapping out the bando
Now the nigga on the radio
Touring doing shows, on the road
Travel all over the globe
But where were you when I was broke
[Hook: Quavo]
[Verse 3: Offset]
As I remember
You quitted on me you surrendered
You pretender, acting like you was there when I was up in the blender
I'm the number one contender, don't hold grudges because I am a forgiver
You niggas make me have a bad temper, (???) said that offended her
I'm still trying to figure out
Where the fuck you was at when a nigga couldn't get out
I'm rich as a bitch with a smart mouth
Like Martin do Pam, bitch get out
Excuse a nigga if I'm acting rude
You was not there when I had no food
You want to start over I'm not a fool
These bitches not loyal she broke the rules
Trifling bitch I'm not wifing it
Left a nigga when I got indicted
You fucked my partner tryna keep it silent
My diamonds shining like the police sirens
My plug on the boat like a pirate
Pussy niggas they don't like me
Real niggas fuckin' with me
Baby girl you wasn't with me
[Hook: Quavo]


[Hook: Quavo of Migos]
Pots in the pan watch me break the stick
Pull up to the kitchen with that strong arm magic stick
J hit the door, and they callin' me Your Majesty
Hit the highway with 50 bricks and a Spanish bitch
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick
Whippin' a whippin' a brick
Whippin' a brick
[Verse 1: Quavo of Migos]
Whippin' a brick, whippin' a whippin' a brick
I'm tryna break the stick
Takin' yo bitch, 
makin' her cook up a brick
I'm tryna work the bitch
My niggas go crazy for babies
I pull up in drop Mercedes
Got Biggie Versace lens on but naw my eyes ain't lazy
My niggas go crazy for checks
Whippin' I'm makin' her sweat
Young nigga I stay with the Tec
I pull up in Rovers and Jags
My nigga keep mavs just like a cadet
I'm givin' the molly to Hannah Montana
I'm pourin' the lean in my Tropicana
Yo bitch bought me a Panamera
Cause her whip game is so special
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff of Migos]
When I'm in the kitchen I turn to a chemist
My wrist just spinnin' I'm doin' my fitness
The pots and the pans got dope all in 'em
The bitch in the kitchen she washin' them dishes
The birds be flyin', the babies be cryin'
My diamonds they make you go blind
Gianni Gianni Versace Versace Medusa Medusa no lie
Christian Louboutin's, like I done committed a crime
I'm servin' and sellin' and whippin' and rappin'
My trap house got a lot
Package it, I'm traffickin'
Them bitches they call me Your Majesty
Like 50 and Kim I got the magic stick
You run up it's gon' be a tragedy
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
28 grams,
 
I'm cookin' a zip
Pull up in a white foreign whip
I'm whippin' a brick
, 
slicker than Rick
Got your main bitch on my dick
Nigga she stick to the tip
Lickin'

Goin' so long with the stick
Swingin' I'm hittin' the fence
Gettin' these chips
Really got millions of shit
Y'all niggas thinkin' you rich
[?] my bitch
Give her that package she takin' that shit on a trip
No location on the Instagram, I'm tryna shake the feds
Plus you know I'm fresh to death, I'm tryna wake the dead
Sip on some shit might take a pic with your bitch
When I visit the vip, might be goin' all the way
I'm Mike Vick with this shit
Whippin' up the extras like some eggs in the A.M
Whippin' a brick, clips gon' start hittin, my car gon' keep dippin
Keep talkin' we livin'
[Hook]


[Hook]
I'm a dog, she a dog too
If he a shooter, I'm a shooter too
I'm a trap nigga, who are you?
Is you mad, cause I'm flexing all on you?
Who the hell? (x3)
Got me fucked up
Who the hell? (x3)
Got me fucked up
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Bitch, who the hell are you?
Im a dog, she a dog too
We know that she fucking the team
Man the whole crew
I'm a fucking fool if I put cuffs on you
Who the hell?
Bet he got trap spots
No bandos, and I can't tell...
Who the hell say I ain't whipping a bell?
My niggas be kicking the doors and running from 12
Fish scales
Pockets deep like water wells
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
I got bombs no Osama
President rollie, Obama
Forty pointers
You can see my diamonds
From cross the corner
Death before dishonor
Middle finger, fuck the your honor
Concrete jungle
If you fumble
Eat you up like piranhas
Who the hell?
Said I won't pull out that chopper
And aim it at your turtle shell
I know that you snitching
You a informant for 12
My niggas they trained to kill
We got bananas
You know they gone peel
[Hook]


[Hook: Quavo]
You know these hoes wishy washy
They'll fuck your partner
Take all of your guala, take your wallet
You know these hoes wishy washy
They hop in my bed, they can't wait to open their legs
They walk in the mall, they can't wait to spend all my bread
Wishy washy, wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, these hoes wishy washy
Wishy washy, I can not trust them
Wishy washy, I can not love them
You gotta watch them, these hoes wishy washy
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Let me tell you a story
'Bout this lil' bitch named Tamara
She'll let you smash for sure today
And then smash your partner tomorrow
She'll ask you can you take care of her
That'll cost you 'bout a couple hundred dollars
Everybody know lil' mama on go
Everybody call her hundred gobbler
Got hoes on hoes like a roster
Is it because of my posture?
But I know it's cause a nigga's dollars
She got a baby, no, I'm not the father
She too wishy washy, she'll go in your pocket
And break your wallet, and you know she got it
But I got the knowledge to go tell her stop it
And she shake like an 8 hit a corner pocket
You can not play me
You know you're too wishy washy
Kick her out the house politely
We noticed you was too excited
No we not going for it, no we not going
You're too wishy washy lil' bitch and you know it
Ain't got time for a kid, the lil' bitch at the front door
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
These hoes wishy washy
Ain't no doubt about it
Quick to put your finger in a young nigga's wallet
And I know you fuckin' my partner
Quick to fuck a nigga for a couple hunna
High class pimpin' these niggas, she got the formula
Suckin' my anaconda, got the flower aroma
And on my mama I'm not fuckin' these bitches without a condom
Wishy washy
Cut these bitches off like hibachi
I'm fuckin' her and her whole posse
If you wanna fuck her then you gotta pay deposit
She givin' up her pussy for the profit
Her mama keep beggin' her to stop it
She really wanna be on red carpets
These bitches ain't shit, it's in the Bible
Talkin' 'bout you got a baby in your stomach
These bitches are funny
They're tryna take a nigga's money
I don't got no feelings for no bitches, I'm numbing
Up to par, my swag from London
These bitches bad, ain't worth nothin'
I'm just sayin', I can see your plan
You wanna get married to a rich man
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
I can't fuck with you bitches, you wishy washy
Neiman Marcus shoppin', she want me to spoil her rotten
But I know that she's plottin' mama said don't trust nobody
This bitch is a vegetarian, all she want is broccoli
I told her if she knew better, she would prolly do better
That Rolex is a Sky-Dweller, got gold all on my Margielas
Pullin' up in a Bentley, no Mr. Bentley
She askin' me where my umbrella
Fox fur [?] and my mink, chinchilla
Flawless diamonds, it's gon' be a cold winter, burr, burr
Don't wanna fuck you, lil' mama, I just want head
These bitches, they can't wait to open their legs
But soon as she pull in my driveway
Pull up to my front door, she got the panties in her hand
She know how to work the pots and pans
She watchin' me like I'm on demand
She the bomb, Osama Bin (Osama Bin Laden!)

I send the pack to the skirt
No job but I'm trappin' I gotta work
[Verse 3 : Quavo]
Hit the block sprayin' with the K

Age of seventeen I juuged my first pound of purp'
[Verse 4 : Takeoff]
Send me the skirt I'm makin' it work
All these dead presidents, I need a hearse
Double cup of Mrs Buttersworth
Molly Sand tan, I got Percocets
Stand in the kitchen I whip me a chicken

If I see 12 then I'm jumpin' them fences
The trap life I live is ridiculous
[Hook]


[Quavo]
Aye yo' name must be Ray Allen or somethin'
You got game nigga
Fuck yo' game; I got wrist game
[Hook: Quavo x2]
I just bought a Bentley wit' my wrist game
Earn my plug trust wit' my wrist game
Fuck a calculator, I got wrist game
Built a house wit' cocaine wit' my wrist game
[Verse 1: Quavo]
Built a house wit' cocaina I'm livin' like a eskimo
Pull up on Tito, he posted at the local corner store
He need a half a bag, remixin' wit' half a swag
Don't hit my phone, won't talk to you, no need to call me back
Whip game, hurricane,
 feelin' like 
Bruce Wayne
Ice chain from Johnny Dang,
 
diamonds kickin' like Liu Kang
Naked bitches in the kitchen sniffin' off of dishes
Got them Thanksgiving turkeys, Quavo sellin' whole chickens
Servin' patients like a clinic, runnin' bands up at Lenox
Quavo President Clinton, selling Monica Lewinsky
I might pull up on you wit' the birds in that 'Rari engine
When them plays come my way, 
I might catch it like a mitten
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Takeoff]
When you got wrist game you can get anything
Gold chains, bought my index a Versace ring
So much coke in my trap spot, the pot's hot
Money jumpin' out my shoe box like Jack Box
Bitches whippin' in the kitchen, bra and panties off
Never think 'bout juugin' cause they know I cut they fingers off
Catch me in Bahamas in Versace sandals
Takeoff got that A-1 dope whip game, Mrs. Campbells
Flats in my panorama, watch me change the channels
All these damn babies, use saran for the pampers
Change my name to Tetris cause I got so many blocks
In the trunk I got two blocks I might just pull up on yo' block
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
My whip game it is so crazy get them bricks from them boys in Haiti
Cocaine and water create it, in the kitchen I'm making them babies
Yo' closet filled wit' Old Navy, my closet filled wit' old babies
I'm whippin', I'm whippin' them pots in the kitchen, you know I be gettin' I'm flippin' them benjis
Run wit' the pack then I'm cuttin' yo' throat, before I buy coke, I gotta get quote
Breads by the loads, bring 'em on boats, I fly overseas I'm doin' the most
No lie, I will take a oath, finesse the plug, it's time for a toast
I started wit' 'bows and started wit' grams and now I'm sellin' them wholes
I feel like John Gotti, them bricks in my Masi
Let's have a trap party, I'm bringin' iCarly
They think that I'm surfin', my dope is so gnarly
Lil' Daryll whip, my dope is retarded
The feds keep talkin', they say I'm a target
I'm slam dunkin' bricks they call me Amar'e
You know I got bucks but not from Milwaukee
It's never a drought, it's bricks on the market
[Hook]


[Intro: Quavo]

Every since I introduced her to molly

Nigga try to rob me for my narcotics
If she fool you once

Breaking rules
Nigga skipping school
Young nigga jumped in the money pool

But some McDonald's
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Quavo]

She bring me the profit
You go out yo' way
And she break in yo' wallet
She calling my phone

I always stress her
You always press her
Talking 'bout where she been
She trapping for me
And she bought me a bezel
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
You niggas a fool

Giuseppe stepping, skin made of mule
OG gas bags, cow manure
Sipping on Actavis, oil fuel
The streets is like tug-o-war I got pull
Diamonds pissy shit on you like sewers
Rich nigga, smoother than velour
Must be kidding me cuffing that bitch you a idiot
Can't read between the lines you illiterate
The plug threw the work and I had to deliver it
Throw the money on the floor like i'm littering
You is a fool cause you don't take advice
Don't fuck with the snake bitch
The rats and the mice
*ring*
Hello (Hello?)
Can't talk on the phone about prices

Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets

[Hook]
[Verse 2 : Takeoff]
You can do Truey,

You know that I'm living

Rockin' handcuffs, that's Ferragamo
Bricks by the boat, overload

This the life that I chose
Bought out the store can't go back no more

Versace took over, it took out my soul

Order up 500 1s, I throw it all it follies
Plug in Japan, so we kick it like karate
Bad bitch from Switzerland, her daddy G. O`Donnie
Every time I'm on the phone we talkin' 'bout some money
I weigh it up, and wrap it up, I ship it across the country
The streets a concrete jungle, play the game like it's Jumanji
[Hook]
[Verse: Offset]
My pockets is sloppy, only buy Rarris and Gottis
My clothes are exotic,

Migo gang is my posse, takin' over like the Nazi's

Hunnid bands, in all hundreds, when I make it rain it thunder
Cop a Lam every summer
, wrappin' bricks like it's a condom
I'm a rich nigga bitch, don't even think about licks
Slap a nigga with a stack,
 
then I piss on that bitch
In the club sippin lean, but I'm still buying cris
Shawty wanna talk to Offset, bitch you ain't on the list
Don't mix the lean with the sprite, drink my mud out the seal
I'm in Louie and Bally, I rock my bitches Chanel
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Young Rich Nigga follow me like Twitter
All green diamonds on my neck look like the Riddler
Red white & green Louis bought them on the day of Christmas
Im the teacher you the student put you in detention
I got the camic you my chef and put you in the kitchen
Now you dirty dancing boarding wippin washing dishes
I took yo main bitch and then I turned her to my mistress
Pull up in Audi pull up in Rarri whip full of net it is a mystery
The rich nigga of the century its going down in history
Energizer bunny wrist keep going it got energy
Back then you ain't know me now that sack make you remember me
Got that 45 for my enemy

So I had to make a mission like the famous Jett Jackson
Got all these pocket rockets on my body
Lookin like a young nigga got go go gadgets

[Intro – Quavo]
You know goddamn well that nigga you with ain’t shit
Your nigga not loving you right
You know goddamn well that nigga you with ain’t shit
You gon need a thug in your life
[Hook – Ty Dolla $ign]
You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
You say your nigga ain’t loving you right
Girl you need a thug in your life
Somebody that’ll pull up
Somebody that’ll pull up and beat it down
[Verse 1 – Ty Dolla $ign]
First off, he weak
Cut him off, fuck with me
Good weed, long beach
Girl you can get it wherever whenever
Just tell me you need that, I pull up
You need some love, [?] some
Stay with him, or leave with me
I see you caught up in something that you don’t really want to be in
[Hook]
[Verse 2 – Ty Dolla $ign]
You say immature, but this the cure
On top of all that, she the sexiest one
Every time I see you out, you ain’t looking at me
Your eyes tell me that you wish it was [?]
You say you want it, he can’t afford it
He working on it, what the fuck do that mean?
Anyway, at the end of the day
You just caught up in something that you don’t really want to be in
[Hook]
[Bridge – Ty Dolla $ign]
All of these girls at my table
I got Ciroq, Cris, and cocktails at my table
I see you looking over here at my table
Cause a nigga that do it ain’t able
Do it like this shawty
[Verse 3 – Quavo]
You know goddamn well that nigga you with ain’t shit
I didn’t mean to flex on him, but he ain’t got it like this
I know she want to ride in my foreign whips
When we fly out to Japan, your mom can’t go this year
[Verse 4 – Takeoff]
Your nigga not loving you right, you know that ain’t right
That’s why you crying at night
I could change your life (put you on ice)
[?] Bugatti do something I like
Can’t make you my wife
Cause I heard you be stripping at night
And that ain’t my type
You want to thug, I’ll show you some love
I want you to take them trips to meet the plug
[Verse 5 – Offset]
Your nigga retire, your bitches got hired
I'm living my life like The Wire
She looking at me, she admire
The pussy singing like American Idol
My diamond pissing, Imma need me a diaper
She love when I pick her up in a new Spyder
She won’t get a wedding ring, treat her to better things
Alexander McQueen

[Intro]
Uh, Versace remix you already know, whats good
[Verse: Samer Khalil]
Leaving my past behind, future aside, present alive
Uh, rolling with my caravan, no frenchies no comment ca va
Pushin`niggas off the top, too much pot, I should open up a shop
Rocking Louis jeans, belt Armani and Versace top
Smoking on that green, making that green all with the team
Hustling streets, they keeping it quiet like they ain't seen no fucking thing
We all toking up, been thinking plots and just chasing dreams
Keeping it real, everyday blowing offs of steam
Pulling up with rings, rolling up like kings
Coming up like a storm hit, haters hate cause we porsching
In the studio recording, doing it like it's important
Versace game we join it, top of the game we force it
Versace everything, believe in it like Peter Pan
Some things you just can't stand, cause it ain't planned and you late fam
They get reeled in, with no bands and they buy grams and they proud of them
How you stand your ground when you've got no ground to stand?
What's a peasant to a king
You don't get this, mother fucking Versace on his hit list
Foreign cars fast as fuck you probably missed us
Cemetery grave cause you diss us
Better think twice, if you want your life
When we roll up to your crib you, think through your rights
Think money think long, keep the future bright
If you're smart about your game, you'd stay out of sight
Got love for this like Aphrodite
Think money think long, keep the future bright, and get at me
[Hook: Quavo]

If you wanna be a rap artist
Gotta take over your town (the city!)
If you wanna be a dope dealer
Gotta be moving a pound (Ew! Gas!)
Young nigga just stay focused

[Verse 2: Offset]
I'm richer than Richie, now all my bitches they miss me
I was broke I remember

I know niggas that envy me, jealousy
Wondering how did I get rich with these felonies
God keep on telling me;
'Please just focus!'
I came from roaches to Lotus
They hung my brother like posters
The Lord he told me I'm chosen
Now all my jewelry is golden
Sipping on purple potion, take away all the emotions (Lean!)
Christian Louboutins, I'm not running from my emotions
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
Unfortunate, ya'll fuck niggas can't fuck with us
Hundred gas bags in the monster truck

Real street nigga that love to hustle, came from the gutta
My nigga be flexing, pressing
I'm fucking that bitch that you texting
You stressin? (Haha)
We just sitting in here counting cash, trying not to laugh
All of these presidents, OG gas
Sipping on Actavis out the glass
Hundreds older than the ThunderCats
What would you do, if you found out that your face card wasn't approved
Ain't no money getting extorted
Look at that what these streets will do

Versace Versace Versace Versace
These outfits perfectly
The type i choose in stores all the time daily and weekly
That chick dig my old belt so i'mma go buy a new versace
Trademark so sweet, you feel like you lickin' on a clean candy
I keep astonishin' people like they're dumber than the star Patrick
No prohibition, i come through naturally not hurtin' ethic
Whatever the color you can wear them on the day of St Patrick
Eyes closed i know i be positive about the matchings
Born to glory, people don't need to bother with question
Matterin' their bodies to be itchin'
Last word's suiting with those who bitchin'
Curse to all of them they think you a pigeon
Ain't nigerian but i sound pigjin'
Givin' a try and check where it dredge in
Ain't stealin' shit, ain't goin' to prison
Taste the track i cooked in the kitchen
I'm the best here, not to mention
If i keep goin' that high, i be like that damn fashion
Came up so high to chill on beats, no hatin'
Gotta respect, got ambition
Winning always been a sorta mission
Can't hide it, no reason
I point my nose out and these bitches are lookin'
Sealed on a stare, they think I'm callin' a booty
They copy, put it back wherever you took it
Safety of your diamonds is wherever you put it
Versace Versace Versace Versace
My bitches are comin'

These snitches act dummy

Every time she see the juice
She say that it scaring her like peek-a-boo
I take her, go dip in the mall
She walking out, Christian Louboutin shoes
Came from 100 bands in the trap hound
To making millions on the mic now
Remember the days in the bando
Used to pull up, it look like the white house
She edgy like me and she humble
She look like her mama
She can get anything from me, keep the hunnas
But a nigga gotta get the commas
Remember the days, suprise on your birthday
Got you the H3 Hummer
Now we on the phone and she on the road
She gonna go get the blue bundle
I know that she loyal, know that she loyal
Know I gotta go spoil her, gotta go spoil her
Man, she look like Kimora, look like Kimora
Wanna ride like Sequoia

Baby girl want some new
She say she want the 2014 Bentley
Baby girl, what you gon' do?
Is it me, is it me? No I think it's you

She said "nooooo, baby don't go"
But I ain't spent my money on a bitch since 1994
[Hook]

You can catch me in the street [?] with Longway and young Guapo
What nigga you know on the North side made a quarter mil in a goddamn bando
Young trap spot nigga, fucking with the migos have your block hot nigga

Yeah she cooking for me, all this money for me
Her name is Alicia, her boss got the key

Mama said I’m gonna give her a heart attack
Bitches ain’t shit, they be fucking no cuffing
She suck me I’m skeeting all over her eyelash
You not from my hood so you don’t get a pass
I’m on the highway, 50 bricks on the bypass
Cook up a brick, break down a brick
Coca on my knuckles looking like ash
Hopping out the Bentley, fucking with the chickens
Throw the money in the air, you got it, ain’t no tricking
Talking bout you got that money nigga, know you fiction
Broke and these niggas keep talking but I ain’t gon listen
Throw the money on the bitches, I done paid tuition
All of my niggas, we migos but we don’t wear dickeys
All of my clothes are exquisite, all of my bitches long distance
Minajing these bitches, no Nicki
Versace my lenses like Biggie
Pussy boy nigga a sissy
Throwing the money like Frisbees
Fuck you talking, fuck nigga I’m strapped
Your bitch keep on staring, your bitch gon get

In the club, Offset keep throwing the racks
Money all over the floor to my kneecaps

Millions in the ceiling, chickens in the couch
If you matching transactions for 3

Made a killing of capping when I was trapping
In Orlando taking more three's than J.J. Redick
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Quavo]
Wells...Fargo, Quavo...Migos
Head...honcho, (Glaaw) Rambo
I hop on the jet, I throw up my set, I land in Quebec

Know what it is, you know what it ain't
I'm trapping and capping the stank
That west-side, you need a green dot, then cop a new shank
Shout out my plug, incredible plug, my nigga Armando
I'm stacking the dub, the fifty, the hundred, a way to Wells Fargo
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
All the bricks come whipped up, wrapped up
Packed up, sent out with official bar-code
On the stove with the coco, going loco, whip whipping up a whole brick of mayo

Deuce Bigalow, when I'm running through your city, what you snitching fo'
I heard that they call you Wells Fargo because you got M&Ms stuffed in your cargo
I'm walking around, I got red on my shoe and it's red on my car, Eldorado

3 AK's like the Klu Klux Klan

Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I’m ‘Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changin’ cause I’m at the top and ain’t no one on top of me
Niggas be wantin’ a verse for a verse, but man that’s not a swap to me
Drownin’ in compliments, 
pool
 in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I’m sellin’ a million first week, man I guess I’m an optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talkin’ ’bout? Saw this shit comin’ like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I been so quiet, I got the world like “What the fuck is he planning?”
Just make sure that you got a back up plan cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is comin’ September, just wait on it
This year I’m eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like “damn I look great on it”
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don’t ask for my take on it
Speakin’ in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelin’s cause business is business, its strictly financial
I’m always the first one to get it, man that’s how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are callin’ me “Papi”
I’m all on the low, take a famous girl out with me, no paparazzi
I’m tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me

Versace, Versace, I love it, Versace the top of my Audi
My plug, he John Gotti, he give me the dozen, I know that they’re mighty
Shoes and shirt Versace, your bitch want in on my pockets
She ask me why my drawers silk, I told that bitch “Versace”
Cheetah print on my sleeve, but I ain’t ever been in the jungle
Try to take my sack, better run with it, nigga don’t fumble
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Takeoff]
You can do Truey, I do it Versace
You copped the Honda, I copped the Mazi
You smoke the mid, I smoke exotic
I set the trend, you niggas copy
Kick in the door like I work at Hibachi
Look at the watch, blow it, hot like some Taki
Come in my room, my sheet Versace
Go to sleep, I dream Versace
Medusa, Medusa, Medusa
[Hook]

SQUAD! There's a panorama in the drive-way
FEDS watching we in da projects
They know we ain't posed to be driving dat
They know we ain't posed to be driving dis
Fucking the net ness in the alley cat
Trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
The police ain't liking it, we still handle business
We trap in the trenchez, we flex in the trenchez
The police ain't liking it, we still handle business
[Verse 1: OffSet]
The trap got niggas on top of the roof they assassins
My plug from Saudi Arabia call him Aladdin
We pulling 'em triggers and 'Rarris and pull up in Aston
The feds they mad, they know what we doin', can't catch us
I stand on the stove, I beat the pot up like I'm Cassius
They call me Chris Angel, work disappear like it, it's magic
The scale make sure the grams is accurate
Wrap it in plastic, then I package it
Mohammed need bricks up in Africa
Go to California, we smoking medicals
Professional, money all ova my schedule
I made a million, that's historical
Pray to God because I am biblical
Work take her clothes off like a physical
When I cook up a baby, they come out identical
Bill Nye cause I'm whippin up chemicals
Workin' been trapping ten years, boy you pitifull
[Hook: OffSet]
[Verse 2: Skippa Da Flippa]
We still handle business, sins I committed
I'm countin up tickets

Young nigga, I did it
I Did it, we did it
What's that in yo drive-way?
Maybe carma fisker, skirr, fisker
Young nigga get wicha, yes, im da Flippa

Who stay ten toes
Might pull up in a Rover, hit me some hoes
Then touchdown on the Migos
We flexin' in minchi
You wanna keep seat, nigga get yo own section
So much gold on me, ice on me, money on me
That you thought I was Freemason (Freemason)
Neva, you after dem hoes
Blue faces I'm chasin'
She got a back in four thirty five
Countin up green,you think that I'm plankton
(I'm countin' up,gwala)
So what is you driving?
It's nothing u riding
I pull up in something you cannot pronounce
And I smoke by the ounce
[Hook: OffSet]
[Verse 3: TakeOff]
The hell is you doin'?
Fuck is you doin'? Where the hell is you goin'?
Nigga trynna' steal my flow hit em 44
Make ya brain blow
Murder she wrote
F&N extendo' Subway Footlongs All I tote!
In your neighborhood broad daylight searchin' for another kick door
Slow it down, slow it down
Speed it up breakin' that spatula whippin' that dope
Turn around, turn around
Baby I don't wanna fuck you I just want that throat!
I had a plan to work with that man I ? Now I'm the man
Move to Afghanistan, now I got bands
I'm speakin' the lingo you can't comprehend
[Hook: OffSet]

Hit it wit the remix, re-rock
No straight drop, my whole hood trap
[Verse 1: Pedro Fernando]
My diamonds is dancing
I pull up in Phantoms
I trap out a mansion
My bitches they come cross the border
They naked no bra or no panties
I flour the fish and I flour the fish
And I whip and I'm breaking my wrist
My ice from the glacier
I'm sipping the Lakers
I'm rich like the mayor
Fuck a nigga's feelings, bitch I'm Pedro, I don't give a damn
I just fucked a nigga baby momma off of Instagram
Trapping and trapping it turned into rapping
I don't even know how it happened
The money is coming in an orderly fashion
Young nigga I'm capping and trapping
Flipping the work wit' no spatula
Pull up in 'Rarri, I'm crawling tarantula
My nigga got choppers, berettas and uzis
I promise they'll damage ya
Migo gang, pull up flexin' 30 chains
Lamb no brains, got it off of cocaine
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Offset]
How does it feel to be broke?
White diamonds like coke
Wrapping the brick up like mummies
100 bricks coming on monday
Just a young ass nigga, thats 15
Chapo wit' the red beam
No Rockets I got Yao Mings
Yadda Mean?
I'm speaking bilingual
I'm talking in spanish
That Mota', coca'
Baking soda
Feeling like Pablo Escobar
Trapping in Louis V Loafers
So much got damn cash
I feel like a Bank of America broker
Got shooters wit me nigga

The game is not checkers it's chess
No spades it's poker
I travel the world, you local
Mo bags then Krogers
Young nigga, with a hundred rounds
Bitch it's over
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Quavo]
White (Coca), bricks
Wrap 'em up, ship 'em out
My whole hood trap, my whole hood trap (Huh!)

Young nigga finna blow ya brains out
Tornado arms
Play wit the water like thunderstorm

So please do not call me Saddam
You bitch like my cum
So I skeet a lil bit on her tongue
12 hit the block, 12 hit the block
What ya gone do? Better run

Trap with extension across the map
Work in the trunk
Hunnids in the back
I ain't never seen hunnid racks look this flat
Blue benjis!
Trap in the maybach with curtains in it
QC we winning
Trappa turned rappa I meant it
[Hook]


[Verse 1: X Blake Freeman X]
When I met you for the first time it was more than somethin'
A brand new feelin' so that just kept me comin'
Anywhere I took you it really didn't matter
The worst places, the best times, and I memorized that pattern
I drove in a blizzard just to see that face
With Migos blastin' the whole dang way
Thinking about you, planning on what to say
When I finally saw you I couldn't look you in the face
You know how nervous I get, this isn't a surprise
I have to look away, that's something you've realized
If I look at you too long I get distracted by those eyes
Everything I've said is the truth, I've never told you no lies
[Hook: X Blake Freeman X]
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime
When we finally get together and I can call you mine
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime
When we finally get together and I can call you mine
[Verse 2: X Blake Freeman X]
This has happened before, why'd I try it again?
I realized how I lost you, maybe this time I'd win
Looking at it now I realize none of this is our fault
I would text you all the time but we're just not allowed to talk
I would write you some letters or I'd call you all the time
On the inside I'm broken but play it off like I'm just fine
'Til my nerves get the best of me and I break down and cry
Pull down my sailor hat just to cover up and hide
You held me, I held you, it rained on us outside
I tell you ''I gotta go'' but I don't call that a goodbye
I tell you that I love you and to remember this night
And we'll end up being together and then you started to cry
[Hook: X Blake Freeman X]
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime
When we finally get together and I can call you mine
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime
When we finally get together and I can call you mine
[Verse 2: Quavo of Migos]
I'm packin' my bags I'm gone (yeah)
Ignore all the signs, I'm goin' blind
Taking you off of my mind
You did me wrong for the last time (whoa)
But I cannot spoil you cause' that's a waste of time
See you at my show in Atlanta
Gettin' freaky for the cameras
She told me her name was Tamra
Boy, that's an exotic dancer
My homie told me that they rent her
Swith em' all like baby Pampers
I got a new baby, Tampa
[Hook: X Blake Freeman X]
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime
When we finally get together and I can call you mine
I'm packin' my bags for the very last time
There's no reason to run, there's no reason to hide
You're my soul, my love, my partner in crime
When we finally get together and I can call you mine
[Outro: X Blake Freeman X]
For the very last time
For the very last time


(Intro)
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
We’d be in the same room
We don’t ever say shit
Let’s keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don’t know)
[Verse 1: Rico Love]
I’m the one you be texting
When you be up at your job (They don’t know)
I’m the one that brought that Benz that’s in your garage (They don’t know)
I’m the reason you don’t stress when shit gets hard
And anything you want, it’s all yours
They don’t know
On your birthday I’m the one who saw your birthday suit (They don’t know)
Got that Birkin bag and bought that birthday coupe (They don’t know)
I keep it all real
I ain’t gotta tell lies to you
You’re the only one who knows the truth
[Hook]
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
We’d be in the same room
We don’t ever say shit
Let’s keep it between me and you
And we cool (Cause they don’t know)
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t know
They don’t even know I know you
You don’t be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but keep it cool
Cause they don’t
[Verse 2: Quavo]
They don’t even know that I know you’re feeling me and you walk around like you don’t know
They don’t even know that you been down since a nigga trappin' in the bandos
They don’t even know that we made it
She helped me run up the big cases
I get on my knees and I’m prayin, ask God for this lady
They don’t know nothing about me, know nothing about you
Keep it that way, cool, they don’t know
If I go way back we’ve been fuckin with each other since high school
They don’t even know that she keep a 44
In the Berkin bag might go boom
Just telling you something about her
Cause you may know nothing about her
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Offset]
They don’t know Offset
They don’t even have a clue
They don’t know
When a nigga was stuck fucked up
In the county couldn't move
Every move
Every bitch left me but you
She was there
Young Offset is feelin’ you
Your head game is critical
I’m touching your body, I’m giving a physical
These bitches they hatin’, they envy you
If a nigga get pulled over she gon hold the work
It should be a crime how she hold a nigga down
Cut the other hoes off cause she said her feelings hurt
Up and down’s in relationship but we gon make it work
[Verse 4: Takeoff]
If I ain’t tell her you ain’t tell her, who they talkin bout then? (They don’t know)
I swear they don’t know how much time we’ve spent (They don’t know)
We started off talkin in French (They don’t know)
Blowin OG in the wind
The first one to show her a chicken
So much loyalty, so much loyalty
They don't know I bought the Benz
Chanel bag, put red on the bottom your shoes
They don’t know
And you say you want a hair salon
So I paid for her tuition, I had her schooled
[Hook]
[Outro]
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
Cause they don’t know
