[Hook]
I like pleasure spiked with pain
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Songbird sweet and sour Jane
And music is my Aeroplane
It's my Aeroplane
Pleasure spiked with pain
That motherfucker's always spiked with pain
[Verse 1]
Looking in my own eyes, hey Lord
I can find the love I want
Someone better slap me
Before I start to rust
Before I start to decompose
Looking in my rearview mirror
Looking in my rearview mirror
I can make it disappear
I can make it disappear, have no fear
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Sitting in my kitchen, hey girl
I'm turning into dust again
My melancholy baby
The star of Mazzy must
Push her voice inside of me
I'm overcoming gravity
I'm overcoming gravity
It's easy when you're sad to be
It's easy when you're sad, sad like me
[Hook]
Just one note could make me float
Could make me float away
One note from the song she wrote
Could fuck me where I lay
Just one note could make me choke
One note, that's not a lie
Just one note could cut my throat
One note could make me die
[Hook]
[Children]
My aeroplane, my aeroplane...
It's my Aeroplane...

[Verse 1]
Oh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peaceable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek
[Chorus]
American ghost dance
[Verse 2]
A new man who is with old ways
He walks the streets of life
But he's in chains
I'm alive he cried
I can feel the flame
Burning red inside
I am an Indian brave
There is a memory
That lives in my blood
Of the brand you laid
On all you touched
But the burning flame
Turns to burning pain
Genuine genocide
And that's truly insane
So like a wild hurricane
I will dance on the grave
Of my race that died
When it should have been saved
[Chorus]
American Ghost Dance!
[Verse 1 again]
Oh give me a home
Where the buffalo roam
And the death of a race is a game
Where seldom is heard
A peaceable word
From the white trash
Who killed as they came
Though these words dig deep
They offer no relief
God save the queen
I am an Indian chief
There is a secret I keep
It's called the talking leaf
And you better believe
That he speaks his beliefs
Like a rock that bleeds
A sea of grief
My talking leaf speaks of
A wounded knee creek
[Chorus]
American ghost dance

[Verse 1]
All aboard... stitching time
Get yours... got mine
In a minute... ill be there
Sit tight... get square
You can do it at the hippodrome
Slide back... trombone
Anybody got a TV at home
That's right... unknown
[Chorus 1]
When I pick up on that smell
Pick it up and run like hell
Little woman send me some
Better get up on your run
[Chorus 2]
So much more than
Charlie's waking me
To my core and
Charlie's shakin' me
Tell my story
And Charlie's making me
And Charlie's making me smile
Oh, Oh, now
[Verse 2]
Everybody... do the twist
Get the the message... on Flea's fists
Move around like a scientist
Lay down... get kissed
Big picture and it never lies
Big daddy... will advice
Eveready... in disguise
Sunset... sunrise
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 3]
My heart... Your skin
This love... I'm in
We don't arrive, without a surprise
You're right... I'm wrong
Be free... Be long
Intimate sight has come into light
[Chorus 1]
[Bridge]
All I ever wanted to
Was pick it up and run with you
Slip it into a summer spell
Double up and run like hell
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 3] [x2]

[Verse]
Catholic school girls rule
In the class she's taking notes
Just how deep deep is my throat
Mother Mary don't you know
She's got eyes like Marilyn Monroe
Catholic school girls rule
From the cross she's raised her head
This is what the sister said
Give no love until you're wed
Live no life until you're dead
The good books says we must suppress
The good books says we must confess
But who cares what the good books says
Cause now she's taking off her dress
Catholic school girls rule
[Outro]
Lead us into temptation
We are pure divine creation
Talking about my generation
Injected with the seed of emasculation
Catholic!

Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication
It's the edge of the world
And all of western civilization
The sun may rise in the east
At least it settles in a final location
It's understood that Hollywood
Sells Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Celebrity skin is this your chin
Or is it war you're waging
First born unicorn
Hard core, soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Cailfornication
Marry me girl be the fairy to my world
Be my very own constellation
A teenage bride with a baby inside
Getting high on information
And buy me a star on the boulevard
It's Californication
Space may be the final frontier
But it's made in a Hollywood basement
And Cobain can you hear the spheres
Singing songs off 
And Alderaan's not far away
It's Californication
Born and raised by those who praise
Control of population
Well, everybody's been there
And I don't mean on vacation
First born unicorn
Hard core, soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Cailfornication
Dream of Cailfornication
Dream of Cailfornication
Destruction leads to a very rough road
But it also breeds creation
And earthquakes are to a girl's guitar
They are just another good vibration
And tidal waves couldn't save the world
From Californication
Pay your surgeon very well
To break the spell of aging
Sicker than the rest, there is no test
But this is what you're craving
First born unicorn
Hard core, soft porn
Dream of Californication
Dream of Cailfornication
Dream of Cailfornication
Dream of Cailfornication

[Chorus]
Cabron, cabron
Cabron, cabron
[Verse 1]
I see you in the park
You're always wearing dodger blue
Mad doggin' me and
Anyone from any other crew
I'm small but I'm strong
I'll get it on with you
If you want me to
What else can I do?
Everyone would take a cue
From anything you do
If you want them to
What else can they do?
[Pre-Chorus]
I don't want to fight
I want to get along with you
This time of night's
For singing songs
About the local news
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I'll come around and make peace
Get down, have a barbeque
Let's keep the moon awake
And do electric boogaloo
I am small but I am strong
You see I'm just like you
If you only knew
That I'm just like you
All the world would
Take a cue from
Anything you do
If you only knew
That they're just like you
[Pre-Chorus] x2
[Chorus] x2
If you want me to
What else can I do
Cause I'm just like you
If you only knew
[Chorus] x2

[Chorus]
Standing in line to
See the show tonight
And there's a light on
Heavy glow
By the way I tried to say
I'd be there waiting for
Dani the girl is
Singing songs to 
me
Beneath the marquee
Overload
[Verse 1]
Steak knife, card shark
Con job
, 
boot cut
Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
To get there quick
By street but not the freeway
Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play
Dogtown
, blood bath
Rib cage, soft tail
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Black jack
, 
dope dick
Pawn shop, quick pick
Kiss that dyke
I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one
Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like
A story, so I told one
Song bird, main line
Cash back, hard top
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Live and die before I get it done, will you decide?
I'll take my words and turn them into sounds, it will survive
Because a long time ago, I knew not to deprive
It's safe out there and now you're everywhere, just like the sky
And you are love, you are the love supreme, you are the rye
And when you hear this,You know it's your jam,It's your goodbye
[Chorus]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the drummer drums
He's going to play my song
To carry me along
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone
And when the boatman comes to ferry me away
To where we all belong
[Verse 2]
We all crossed
When we were feeling lost
It's just the time
Kateri cried
The day her lover died
She recognized
Because you gave her
A life of real love
It's no surprise
The night's are long
But the years are short
When you're alive
Way back when
Will never be again
It was a time
It's going to catch you
So glad I met you
To walk a line
[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 3]
Then we live
So every time you die
He's in the revert sky
Lay me down
So when it's time to leave
Another sun will rise
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
I said yeah!
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Like I said you know I'm almost dead
You know I'm almost gone

All alone not by myself
Another girl bad for my health
I've seen it all through someone else
(Another girl bad for my health)
Celebrated but undisturbed
Serenaded by the terror bird
It's seldom seen and it's never heard
(Serenaded by the terror bird)
[HOOK]
Never in the wrong time or wrong place
Desecration is the smile on my face
The love I made is the shape of my space
My face my face
Disintegrated by the rising sun
A rolling blackout of oblivion
And I like to think that I'm your number one
(a rolling blackout of oblivion)
I wanna leave but I just get stuck
A broken record runnin' low on luck
There's heavy metal coming from your truck
I'm a (a broken record runnin' low on luck)
[HOOK]
We could all go down to Malibu and make some noise
Coca Cola doesn't do the justice she enjoys
We could all come up with something new to be destroyed
We could all go down
I love the feeling when it falls apart
I'm slow to finish but I'm quick to start and
Beneath the heather lies the meadowlark
And I'm(Slow to finish but quick to start)
[HOOK] x 2

[Verse 1]
It started when we were little kids
Free spirits, but already tormented by our own hands
Given to us by our parents
We got together and wrote on desks
And slept in laundry rooms near snowy mountains
And slipped through whatever cracks we could find
Minds altered, we didn't falter
In portraying hysterical and tragic characters in a smog filled universe
We loved the dirty city
And the journeys away from it
We had not yet been or seen our friends, selves
Chase tails round and round in downward spirals
Leaving trail of irretrievable, vital life juice behind
Still, the brothers, blood comrades, partner, family, cousin was impenetrable
And we lived inside it
Laughing with no clothes, and everything experimental until death was upon us
In our face, mortality
And lots of things seemed futile then, but love and music can save us
And did, while the giant grey monster grew
More poisoned and volatile around us
Jaws clamping down and spewing ugly shit around
Nothing is the same
So we keep moving
We keep moving
[Chorus 1]
(Ooh Shit! Ooh Shit!)
[Verse 2]
Went off and got some hair cuts
Looking wild and got all drugged up
Hopped a train into the night
Got a ride with a transvestite
Two boys in San Francisco
Two boys in San Francisco
Blasted off in a Bart bathroom
Those coppers woke us up
The motherfuckers woke us up
[Chorus 2]
Two young brothers on a hovercraft
Telepathic love and belly laughs
[Verse 3]
Storm the stage of Universal
Slim shine talk boy go subversal
Papa's proud and so he sent us
Pounding hearts full and relentless
Two boys in London, England
Two boys in London, England
Climbing out of hostel windows
Wearing gear so out but in though
Come on kid and do the no, no
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 4]
We went to Fairfax High School
Jumped off buildings into their pools
We'd sit down and grease at Canters
Run like hell they can't catch us
Two boys in L.A. proper
Two boys in L.A. proper
Stealing anything that we could
Got to sneak into the Starwood
Got to peak into the deep good
I remember
10 years ago in Hollywood
We did some good
And we did some real bad stuff
But the Butt-hole Surfers said
It's better to regret something you did
Than something you didn't do
We were young
And we were looking
Looking
Looking for that deep kick
Seen them come, seen them go
[Outro]
(And I feel I'm getting close to you)

[Verse 1: RHCP]
Bear paws and rascal power
Watching us in your garage
Big girl you ate the neighbor
The nova is over
Wake up and play
Balleradio
Make room for Clara's bare feet
The love of a Martian
Tick tock and waiting for the meteor
This clock is opening another door
[Hook: RHCP]
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know how to say
Losin' what I love today
These are the best that I
Lots of love just keep it comin'
Makin' something out of nothin'
These are the best that I
I don't know what to say
Look at what I've lost today
And these are the things that I
[Verse 2: RHCP]
Blood flowers in the kitchen
Signing off and winding down
This Martian ends her mission
The nova is over
She caught the ball
By the mission bell
Chase lizards, bark at donkeys
The love of a Martian
Let's bow our heads
And let the trumpets blow
Our girl is gone
God bless her little soul
[Hook: RHCP]
[Outro: RHCP]
She’s got sword in case
Though this is not her Lord, in case
The one who can’t afford to face
Her image is restored to grace
Disappeared. No trace. Musky tears. Suitcase
The down turn brave little burncub bearcareless turnip snare rampages pitch color pages
Down and out but not in Vegas
Disembarks and disengages. No loft
Sweet pink canary cages plummet pop dewskin fortitude for the sniffing black noses that snort and allude
To the dangling trinkets that mimic the dirt cough go drink its
It's for you
Blue battered naval town slip kisses delivered by duck muscles and bottlenosed grifters
Arrive in time to catch the late show
It's a beehive barrel race. A shehive stare and chase
Wasted feature who tried and failed to reach her
Embossed beneath a box in the closet that's lost
The kind that you find when you mind your own business
Shiv sister to the quickness before it blisters into the newmorning milk blanket. 
Your ilk is funny to the turnstyle touch bunny
Whose bouquet set a course for bloom without decay
Get your broom and sweep echoes of yesternights fallen freckles…. away…

Gettin' born in the state of Mississippi
Poppa was a copper and her momma was a hippie
In Alabama she was swinging hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world, what does your company take me for?
Black bandana, sweet Louisiana
Robbin' on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way saying baby what you gonna
Lookin' down the barrel of a hot metal .45
Just another way to survive
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
She's a lover, baby and a fighter
Should've seen her coming when it got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew what others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true, too sad sad sad
Push the fader, gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man was a gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah
California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show your teeth
She's my priestess, I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah

Dear 
everybody
When we were asked by the NFL and Bruno to play our song 
Give It Away
 at the Super Bowl, it was made clear to us that the 
vocals would be live, but the bass, drums, and guitar would be pre-recorded
. I understand the NFL's stance on this, given they only have a few minutes to set up the stage, there a zillion things that could go wrong and ruin the sound for the folks watching in the stadium and the t.v. viewers. There was not any room for argument on this, the NFL does not want to risk their show being botched by bad sound, period
The Red Hot Chili Peppers stance on any sort of miming has been that we will absolutely not do it. The last time we did it (or tried to) was in the late 80's, we were thrown off of '
The Top Of the Pops
' television program in the U.K. during rehearsals because we refused to mime properly, I played bass with my shoe, John played guitar atop Anthony's shoulders, and we basically had a wrestling match onstage, making a mockery of the idea that it was a real live performance
We mimed on one or two weird MTV shows before that and it always was a drag. We take our music playing seriously, it is a sacred thing for us, and anyone who has ever seen us in concert (like the night before the Super Bowl at the Barclays Center), knows that we play from our heart, we improvise spontaneously, take musical risks, and sweat blood at every show. 
We have been on the road for 31 years doing it
So, when this Super Bowl gig concept came up, there was a lot of confusion amongst us as whether or not we should do it, but we eventually decided, it was a surreal-like, once in a life time crazy thing to do and we would just have fun and do it. We had given this a lot of thought before agreeing to do it, and besides many a long conversation amongst ourselves, I spoke with many musician friends for whom I have the utmost respect, and they all said they would do it if asked, that it was a wild trippy thing to do, what the hell. 
Plus, we the RHCP all love football too
 and that played a big part in our decision. We decided that, with Anthony singing live, 
that we could still bring the spirit and freedom of what we do into the performance
, and of course we played every note in the recording specially for the gig. I met and spoke with Bruno, who was a beautiful dude, a real talented musician, and we worked out something that seemed like it would be fun
We recorded a track for the day, just banged one out from our hearts that was very like in spirit to the versions we have been playing live the last few years with our beloved Josh on guitar
For the actual performance, Josh, Chad, and I were playing along with the pre recorded track so there was no need to plug in our guitars, so we did not. Could we have plugged them in and avoided bumming people out who have expressed disappointment that the instrumental track was pre recorded? Of course easily we could have and this would be a non-issue. We thought it better to not pretend. It seemed like the realest thing to do in the circumstance. It was like making a music video in front of a gazillion people, except with live vocals, and only one chance to rock it. Our only thought was to bring the spirit of who we are to the people
I am grateful to the NFL for having us. And I am grateful to Bruno, who is a super talented young man for inviting us to be a part of his gig. I would do it all the same way again
We, as a band, aspire to grow as musicians and songwriters, and to continue to play our guts out live onstage for anyone who wants to get their brains blown out
Sincerely
Flea

[Verse 1]
Can't stop; addicted to the shin dig
Chop Top; he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunkt; the pistol that you pay for
This punk; the feeling that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
Eastside love is living on the westend
Knocked out but boy you better come to
Don't die, you know the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screaming in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with 50 belly dancers
[Chorus]
The world I love
The tears I drop to be part of the wave can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you
The world I love
The trains I hop to be part of the wave can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to
[Verse 2]
Sweetheart is bleeding in the snowcone
So smart she's leading me to ozone
Music the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight the gold of meditation
This chapter's going to be a close one
Smoke rings I know you're going to blow one
All on a spaceship persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop
[Chorus]
[Interlude]
Wait a minute I'm passing out
Win or lose just like you
Far more shocking
Than anything I ever knew
How about you
10 more reasons
Why I need somebody new just like you
Far more shocking than anything I ever knew
Right on cue
[Repeat Verse 1]
[Verse 3]
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get 2 maybe even 3 of these
Come from space
To teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read through

[Verse 1]
Never 21 when everyone's a sailor
Coming up strong at the animal bar
Ever loving mug of Mr. Norman Mailer
Turn another page at the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long
[Pre-Chorus]
I I I the cry of isolation
I I I the high of meditation
I I I for sweet precipitation
I I I the high of deprivation
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long
[Chorus]
Rain on my frustration
Stake my claim now break this
Wash me down my station
Make more rain forsaken
In between the sky and every piece of the earth
(1,2,3 lets break this)
Runnin' through the mud
I gotta a feeling of worth
(1,2,3 forsake this)
[Verse 2]
All aboard the ship
Cause you're gonna need an ark
When the wet comes down
You'll be swimming like a shark
Mopping up the stain and
I'm a little older
The song of rain
At the animal bar
And it won't be long
No it won't be long
No it won't be long
Because it can't be long
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Raindrops will fall from the sky
Stealing their shape from your eye
Now we can all get some sleep
The water the water the water
Saving us from the heat
Some things will die in their place
Others will leave little trace
Fire will come find its day
The water the water the water
Washing it all away
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sittin' on a sack of beans
Sittin' down in New Orleans
You wouldn't believe what I've seen
Sitting on that sack of beans
Lunatics on pogo sticks
Another southern fried freak on a crucifix
Hicks don't mix with politics
People on the street just kickin' to the licks
[Hook]
Yes my favorite place to be
Is not a land called Honah Lee
Mentally or physically
I wanna be in New Orleans
[Verse 2]
Oh good brother just when I thought
That I had seen it all
My eyes popped out, my dick got hard
And I dropped my jaw
I saw a bird walkin down the block
Name Apache Rose Peacock
I could not speak I was in shock
I told my knees to please not knock
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
A little boy came along
Name of Louis Armstrong
Said that girl who left me silly
She liked the looks of me and my willy
So I found her in the quarter
Good God how I adored her
Oh she made me feel so cozy
When she told me I could call her Rosey
[Bridge]
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better
[Verse 4]
Twinkle twinkle little star
Shining down on my blue car
Drivin' down the boulevard
She was soft and I was hard
Apache Rose gotta rockin' peacock
Hottest ass on the goddamn block
Rockin' to the beat of the funky ass meters
She has one of those built in heaters
[Bridge]
I kiss your hair your skin so bare
I'll take you with me girl anywhere
You fare well in stormy weather
I never met a girl that I liked better
[Verse 5]
Voodoo gurus casting their spells
Cockatoo drag queens shakin' their bells
Silver sound escapes the trumpet
Watch your leg someone might hump it
Chicken strut your butt let's rock
Gettin' it on under your frock
Flowing like a flame all through the night
My girl's insane but it's all right
[Hook]

All around the world
We could make time
Rompin' and a stompin'
Cause I'm in my prime
Born in the North
And sworn to entertain ya
Cause I'm down for
The state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
Bout the motha' fuckin girls
From California
Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good god girl!
I wish I knew ya
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do
Come back baby
Cause I'd like to say
I've been around the world
Back from Bombay
Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake
Its a lake she's kissin' me
As they do
When they do in Sicily
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it's you
You say hello and then I say I do
Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me
I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sitting in the Swiss mountains
Me Oh My O
Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird
Cause we're rocking Ohio
Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
Cause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure
(inaudible, sounds like an Asian dialect)
I know I know its you
(inaudible, sounds like an Asian dialect)
Mother Russia do not suffer
I know you're bold enough
Ive been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know its you
You say hello then I say I do

[Verse 1]
Here she comes in a suit and tie
Shepard's bush and a leopard's pie
She marching to the funky beat of
James Brown and his dancing feet
Going to set your fish on fire
Pistol whipping of desire
So please do not resist your fate
I'll pick you up, yes it's a date
[Pre-Chorus]
How could I forget to mention the bicycle is a good invention?
Sitting there in a silent movie
Beside the only girl who really ever moved me
Happy days, but sad I'm facing
Heaven knows that I'm on the case
How could I forget to mention the bicycle?
[Chorus]
Somebody told the world
The beauty of your verse
My girl, I heard it first
The beauty of your verse
[Verse 2]
A sticky finger and a wicked taste
Got a lot of love and a lyrical case
Be sure to write it in your book
I promise not to look
Want to smell your sunny face
Funny place but it's never a waste
I'd hop this fence to make amends
I hope this movie never ends
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 1]
Blood sugar sucker fish in my dish
How many pieces do you wish
Step into a heaven where I keep it on the soul side
Girl please me, be my soul bride
Every woman has a piece of aphrodite
Copulate to create a state of sexual light
Kissing her virginity
My affinity
I mingle with the gods
I mingle with divinity
[Hook]
Blood sugar baby
She's magik
Sex magik sex magik
[Verse 2]
Glorious euphoria is my must
Erotic shock is a function of lust
Temporarily blind, dimensions to discover
In time, each into the other
Uncontrollable notes from her snow white throat
Fill a space in which two bodies float
Operatic by voice
A fanatic by choice
Aromatic is the flower
She must be moist
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Anthony Kiedis]
I am a man
Cut from the know
Rarely do friends
Come and then go
She was a girl
Soft but estranged
We were the two
Our lives rearranged
Feeling so good that day
A feeling of love that day
[Hook (John Frusciante)]
Twisting and turning
Your feelings are burning
You're breaking the girl
(She meant you no harm)
Think you're so clever
But now you must sever
You're breaking the girl
(He loves no one else)
[Verse 2]
Raised by my dad
Girl of the day
He was my man
That was the way
She was the girl
Left alone
Feeling the need
To make me her home
I don't know what when or why
The twilight of love had arrived
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Indeed, it may seem that we have strange ways
But we do it with compassion and don't believe in age
Travel round the world, getting naked on the stage
Busting people out of their everyday cage
We like to think we make a sad man happy
And we like to make proud our mami and our papi
Funky young kings, we sing of truth and soul
We're the modern day braves with one strong hold
Through the world of song our boldness is exposed
I'm talking about my buddies, funk it up Fishboneeeee!
[Chorus]
Good, good time boys, make me feel good
Give me good times, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Our devotion to emotion is more than evident
To the minds that are open it's you we represent
We hope you have enjoyed the time that you have spent
One day, the good time boys that might jest be president
Like a pack of mad hatters who come from outer space
Our swinging's going to shatter every stone cold face
Now you may not know the exact reason why
A band commands attention from the mountains and the sky
Making more that money, more than money can buy
I stop! And take a listen to the monsters try
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
If you don't believe me you can ask John Doe
Because his heart is made of glory and his voice is made of gold
He'll tell you in a minute about the men he knows
He'll tell you about the band called fire hose
To those of you who doubt the nature of our spirit
We play it out loud for everyone to hear it
Building up our brains with the supernatural powers
We take it from the trees and the mighty watts towers
Aim the flame of freedom at the lames and sours
We're the best of the west and the west is ours
[Chorus]

Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s true, things that you’re going through
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s you, things that you’re going through
Some people sad I pray for
No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his
Some people sad I pray for
The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give
Some people say you played me
I don’t care if it’s true, I’m waiting here for you
Some people say you made it
I’m not afraid to know, when things are getting low
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s true, things that you’re going through
Some people say you hate me
I don’t believe it’s you, things that you’re going through

[Verse 1]
What I've got you've got to give it to your mamma
What I've got you've got to give it to your pappa
What I've got you've got to give it to your daughter
You do a little dance and then you drink a little water
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
What I've got you've got to get it put it in you
Reeling with the 
feeling
 don't stop continue
Realize I don't want to be a miser
Confide with sly you'll be the wiser
Young blood is the lovin' upriser
How come everybody wanna keep it like the kaiser
[Hook]
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
Give it away give it away give it away now
I can't tell if I'm a kingpin or a pauper
[Verse 2]
Greedy little people in a sea of distress
Keep your more to receive your less
Unimpressed by material excess
Love is free love me say hell yes
I'm a low brow but I rock a little know how
No time for the piggies or the hoosegow
Get smart get down with the pow wow
Never been a better time than right now
Bob Marley poet and a prophet
Bob Marley taught me how to off it
Bob Marley walking like he talk it
Goodness me can't you see I'm gonna cough it
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Lucky me swimming in my ability
Dancing down on life with agility
Come and drink it up from my fertility
Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility
My mom I love her cause she love me
Long gone are the times when she scrub me
Feeling good my brother gonna hug me
Drink my juice young love chug-a-lug me
There's a river born to be a giver
Keep you warm won't let you shiver
His heart is never gonna wither
Come on everybody time to deliver
[Hook]
[Repeat 1st Verse]

[Tricky:]
Girls, Boys
Girls wish you never had boys
They grow up to be bad boys
Cry I've never had boys
Never seen your dad boy
I've never seen my dad boy
Without the Roy
And when my career stops kicking
I'm gonna stick him
[Anthony Kiedis:]
Rock-a-dub now let me show you where it's at boy
Just a puppet and you grew into a fat boy
Make a dog and you chase another cat boy
Blow it up and let me show you where its at boy

Staring through the sun tell your devil beware
I am not the son of your family affair
Baby breaks away and I've got my face in my hand
Genetics from my gun, trust me I don't care

I don't need no man
Little boys
[Anthony Kiedis: ]
Rappa rouser, bappa bouser
Shake it for me baby let me step into your trousers
I allow this
Come on baby let me take to the houses

This is now and you better bow this
This is now and you better bow this
This is now and you better bow this

Staring through the sun tell your devil beware (jamaica's skirts and blouses)

Smarter than the average bear

Get on top, get on top
Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me
Go-rilla 
cunt-illa
Sammy D and salmonella
Come with me ’cause I’m an ass killer
You’re ill but I’m iller
I’ll malinger on your block and
Give the finger to a cop and
Pick a lock before I knock and
Set you up to get on top
Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
All in time
Right on
Get up come sit up I light but she lit up
Grass hopper, show stopper
The life of a wife swapper
Come with me ’cause I’m a big bopper
You do but I wopper
Exterminate my cause
You want to draw some straws
Be the one to see my flaws
Make me bleed with painted claws
Complications of a mastermind
Last temptation of my kind
Extra planetary sign
When do we align
Get on top, get on top
Hit me come get me I bite but she bit me
Speed baller, Rhodes Scholar
Bottom bitch and a bottom dollar
Come with me ’cause I’m a free faller
You hoot but I holler
I’ll malinger on your block
Give the finger to a cop
 and
Pick a lock before I knock on
Set you up to get on top

[Verse 1]
It must have been your funny face
It must have been your love
It must have been your paper chase that
Wasn't quite enough
[Verse 2]
It must have been your tiny dance that
Made me laugh out loud
Must have been your angel dust that
Put me on your cloud
[Pre-Chorus]
You're the reason why
You're the reason I
[Chorus]
It must have been your love, oh
It must have been your love, I said
It must have been your love
In a little bit
It must have been your love
[Verse 3]
It must have been your poppy eyes
That made me step outside
It must have been the sight of tears that
Let me know I cried
[Verse 4]
It must have been your bunny shake
It must have been your love
A lot of girls won't come around they
Treat me like a wolf
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
You're my angel baby
You're my darling
You're my star
Lo, lo, lo, lolita
Let her see me deep in love
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
I've stared at eyes in a crooked frown
Make more of life, just settle down
Every single little princess needs a crown
Make more of life, just settle down

[Verse 1]
I'm an ocean in your bedroom
Make you feel warm, make you want to re-assume
Now we know it all for sure
I'm a dance hall dirty breakbeat
Make the snow fall up from underneath your feet
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
[Verse 2]
I'm a meth lab,
 first rehab
Take it all off and step inside the running cab
There's a love that knows the way
I'm the rainbow in your jail cell
All the memories of everything you've ever smelled
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
[Chorus]
(
Sideways falling
More will be revealed my friend
)
Don't forget me, I can't hide it
Come again make me excited
[Verse 3]
I'm an inbred and a pothead
Two legs that you spread inside the tool shed
Now we know it all for sure
I could show you to the free field
Overcome and more will always be revealed
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go
[Chorus]
[Verse 
4]
I'm the bloodstain on your shirt sleeve
Coming down and more are coming to believe
Now we know it all for sure
Make the hair stand up on your arm
Teach you how to dance inside the funny farm
Not alone, I'll be there
Tell me when you want to go

[Verse 1]
There are no monks in my band
There are no saints in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man
Confusion is my middle name
Ask me again I'll tell you the same
Persuaded by one sexy dame
No I do not feel no shame
[Hook]
You are on the road
Can I get a little lovin' from you
Can I get a little bit of that done did do
You are on the road
Tell me now girl that you need me too
Tell me now girl cause I've got a feeling 4 you
[Verse 2]
Every man has certain needs
Talkin' 'bout them dirty deeds
To these needs I must concede
Livin' by my lowly creed
Woman please know that I'm good
Know that I did all I could
But yes it's true likelihood
Of being great is not so good
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
There are no monks in my band
There are no 
saints
 in this land
I'll be doin' all I can
If I die an honest man
Virtue slipped into my shoe
No I will not misconstrue
More rockin' more rockin' now doobley do
Dancin' down your avenue
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
They say at chess you've got to kill the queen
And then you've made it...
Do you?
A funny thing, a king that gets himself
Assassinated...
[Chorus 1]
Hey now, every time I lose...
Altitude...
[Verse 2]
You took the town by storm
Now the mess you made is nominated...
Do you?
Now put away your welcome
Soon you'll find you've overstayed it
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
So divine, hell of an elevator
All the while, my fortune faded
Never mind the consequences of my
Wildest time, my fortune faded...
[Verse 3]
To medicate this state of mind
You'll find is overrated...
Do you?
You saw it all come down and now
It's time to imitate it...
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Come on God, do I seem bulletproof?
[Chorus 2]x2

All you slingers and friends
Hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard
I'm not here to box
This is no showdown
So throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter
Where you come from
You could be from Park Ave
Or from a park bench
You could be a politician
Or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist
And you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together
Make a fist and fight
Not to your death
And not to your grave
I'm talkin' bout that freedom
Fight like a brave
[Chorus]
Fight like a brave - don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
If you're sick-a-sick n tired
Of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit
And you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never
To set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead
So give yourself a break
Get it through your head
And get it off your chest
Get it out your arm
Because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying
The life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story
But I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher
And I'm not your physician
I'm just trying to reach you
I'm a rebel with a mission
[Chorus x2]
You say you're running and you're running
And you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet
But you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain
Was driving you insane
You were looking for a day
In a life that never came
So don't tell me that
I've got to take a number
Cause I've been to that doctor
And believe me that's a bummer
He's one of a kind
Convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention
That it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like
And leave any time
And one more thing
You know it doesn't have to rhyme
[Chorus x4]

[Verse 1]
All my life I was swinging for the fence
I was looking for the triple, never playing good defense
Gunnin' for the glitter
Every hot and heavy hitter
She was never really there so I couldn't really get her
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Piece of work, I was really quite a jerk
Keeping score is such a bore
, a busy mind can go berserk
Oh feast on this, I was fishing for a hook
So I took a little trip, and I opened up the book
[Pre-Hook]
I said
Factually I, I'm just a piece of it
Factually I, the very least of it
Factually I, is just a medicine
Make you wanna cry, why don't they let us in?
[Hook]
Be my wife, I think you right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
[Verse 2]
Crack your whip, she's confessing from the hip
She was good at getting there, but not as much for round-trip
Oh all this time, I was searching for a dream
I was living in and out of every other sex machine
[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]
Be my wife, I think you right that we should mate
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
Late last night, I had a dream that it was great
Tell your friends, I got a factory of faith
I got a factory of...
Faith
And love

[Verse 1]
God is good and fate is great
When it feels so strong it's hard to wait
You never know how it might unfold
Hearts to break and bodies to hold
Time will tell but it never gets old
Like I told you I'm in for a long 
long
Had to have been one of those things
That took place in outer space
A match made in heaven
, not a scratch on her face
Angels must have smoked some dust
Singing songs about "In God We Trust"
Some things slide, but this is a must
Like I told you there's a time for finding out
Ah people try to tell me what not to do
"You shouldn't make it with a younger girl"
 
and
Too many chances for the foot to drop
I tried to tell 'em that I found a pearl, well
Like I told you be careful what you're asking for
[Hook]
Hey, sister Brutus
Got a mess of a better half, ow
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back
[Verse 2]
She was the cutest thing that I ever did see
A drink in her hand and I don't mean tea
She was with a dude, but I just didn't care
I had to find out, these moments are rare
And Stevie says, "All is fair."
Like I told you there is something for everyone
Well I guess I never told you some things
That I really, really wanted to say
Did I do everything I could do
Or did the mice just need to play?
Like I told you there's more than meets the eye
[Hook]
[Bridge]
I'm not trying to point fingers at you
And I'm not trying to lay any blame
But when it comes to the punishment
Girl, you know how to bring the pain
Like I told you I'd do it all again
[Hook]
Come on
Hey, sister Brutus
There's a fury to the woman's wrath
Hey, sister Judas
Even you never had my back

[Verse 1]
E I O I E I A
When you give your love away
You get a feeling for
E I O I E I A
Live to love another day
Even when you feel unsure
More and more I want to raise
Raise my bar and raise your stay
E I O I E I A
When I lie they're wide awake
For my son I make
[Chorus]
Tell my boy I love him so
Tell him so he know
Lost in Ethiopia
Walk out in that 
road
[Verse 2]
E I O I E I A
Something good going to come your way
Just look out your door
E I O I E I A
Tell him what you wanna say
No matter what you mad at girl
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
E I O I E I A
Steal my heart to give away
Make me want to say
E I O I E I A
You and I are so no same
More and more and more each day
[Chorus]

Life is my friend, rake it up to take it in
Wrap me in your cinnamon
Especially in Michigan
Well I could be your friend
White clouds I'm in a mitten full of fisherman
C'mon Huckleberry Finn
Show me how to make her grin
Well I'm in Michigan
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck, yeah
A rainy Lithuanian
Who's dancing as an Indian
Painted in my tiger skin
Especially in Michigan
Double chins and bowling pins
Unholy Presbyterian's
Land is full of medicine
I find it when I'm slipping in
Well, I'm in Michigan
The tainted new librarian
Who fainted when she tucked you in
Let's float away like Zeppelins
On stoic gusts of Northern winds
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck
Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck
Life is my friend 
underwater violins
Order now from Ho Chi Min
A porcelain that comes in twins
Throw me in the loony bin
Cause I can take it on the chin
The cleavage of your pillow skin
Is moving like a violin
Cry me a future
Where the revelations run amok
Ladies and gentlemen
Lions and Tigers come running
Just to steal your luck
Out on the farm we'll be
Swimming with the mother duck
Deep in the mitten where
Lions and tigers come running
Just to steal your luck, oh yeah

The California animal is a bear
Angeleno
, but the devil may care
Summer time to talk and swear
Later maybe we could share some air
I’ll take you to the movies there
We could walk through Leicester square
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right
Hesitate but don’t refuse
The choice was yours but you said choose
The look she used was green and sharp
Stabbed that boy all in his heart
Come what may the cosmos will
Take me up and down on primrose hill
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the 
summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right
It’s all right now
Call me now use the satellite
It’s all right
It’s all right
Down and out and it’ll sound all right
It’s all right now
It’s all right
The California flower is poppy, child
Felony sends me all the gold in your smile
Drift away from anyone you can
Nothing ever goes according to plan
Though I know that every river bends
Time to say hello to snow on the Thames
What could be wetter than
An English girl American man
London in the summer time
Call me now use the satellite
London in the summer time
Cuss me out and it’ll feel all right

[Verse 1]
Easily let's get carried away
Easily let's get married today
[Pre-Chorus]
Shao Lin shouted a rose from his throat
Everything must go
A licking stick is thicker when you break it to show
Everything must go
[Chorus 1]
The story of a woman on the morning of a war
Remind me if you will exactly what we're fighting for
Calling and calling for something in the air
Calling and calling I know you must be there
[Verse 2]
Easily let's get caught in a wave
Easily we won't get caught in a cage
[Pre-Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I can't tell you who to idolize
You think it's almost over but it's only on the rise
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Throw me to the wolves because there's order in the pack
Throw me to the sky because I know I'm coming back
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 1]
[Bridge]
I don't want to be your little research monkey boy
The creature that I am is only going to destroy
[Chorus 2]

I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
In you a star is born
 and
You cut a perfect form and
Someone forever warm
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
[Chorus]
Way upon the mountain where she died
All I ever wanted was your life
Deep inside the canyon I can't hide
All I ever wanted was your life
Show love with no remorse and
Climb on to your seahorse and
This ride is right on course
This is the way I wanted it to be with you
This is the way that I knew that it would be with you
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
Lay on lay on lay on lay on
[Chorus]
I got dosed by you and
Closer than most to you and
What am I supposed to do
Take it away I never had it anyway
Take it away and everything will be okay
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Hustle, bustle and so much muscle
Cells about to separate, oh
And I find it hard to concentrate
And temporary, this cash and carry
I'm stepping up to indicate
The time has come to deviate and
[Chorus]
All I want is for you to be happy
And take this moment to make you my family
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found
[Verse 2]
Death defying, this mess I'm buying
Its raining down with love and hate
And I find it hard to motivate
And estuary is blessed but scary, oh
Hearts about to palpitate
And I'm not about to hesitate
And one to treasure the rest of your days here
And give you pleasure in so many ways, dear
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found
Here we go
Do you want me to show up for duty
And serve this woman and honor her beauty?
And finally you have found something perfect
And finally you have found yourself with me
Will you agree to take this man into your world
And now we are as one
My lone ranger the heat exchanger
Is living in this figure 8
And I'll do my best to recreate
Sweet precision and soft collision, oh
Hearts about to palpitate
And I find it hard to separate
[Chorus] [x2]

Won't somebody come along
And teach me how to keep it alive?
To survive
Come along and show me something
That I never knew in your eyes
Take away the tourniquet
I used to be so full of my confidence
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
More than ever I could use a coincidence
But now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
Let it on, I'll cut you off
When you're screaming into the phone
Hard to own
Anyway, I wanna let you know
That everything is on hold
What you gonna do to me?
You used to be so warm and affectionate
All the little things I used to hear my fairy say
But now you're quick to get into your regret
I'll take the fall and now you got to give it all away
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess I ought to walk away
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
I don't wanna have to, but I will
If that's what I'm supposed to do
We don't wanna set up for the kill
But that's what I'm about to do
Hey, what would you say if I stayed?
Stayed for a while, if I may
Say it again and I'll come around
But not for the last time
Hey, what would you say if I changed?
I'll change everything but my name
Play it again and I'll come around
But not for the last time
You used to be so warm and affectionate;
I used to know just what I wanted
And just where to go
And now you're quick to get into your regret;
And now I walk alone and talk about it when I know
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta walk away;
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?
Hey, oh yeah, how long?
I guess you gotta get away;
Hey, oh yeah, so long
What you gonna do today?

[Verse 1]
Deep inside the soul hole
Of Mother Earth
Father Time came
With a supersonic supersonic burst
His soul monkey sperm tribes
Racing to be first
Her ruby fruit jungle
Givin' bush baby bush baby birth
The baby was a boy
But I think what stunned her
Is that this bare breasted baby
Was a baby boy boy boy boy wonder
Crackin' from his thumb bone
Came thelonious thunder
Fill the sky with hellfire
From way down down down under
[Chorus]
I am a jungle man[x3]
I get all the bush I can
[Verse 2]
Erupting from the ground
In Hollywood he glowed
His jungle turned to concrete
His funk bone bone bone bone to stone
Like a full blown volcano
I must let it be known
That through this boy's vein
Atomic lava blood flows and flows
His soul shocking sounds
They make the mountains moan
This boy's become a man
It's time to take take take
Take the throne
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Never too soon to be through
Being cool too much, too soon
Too much for me, too much for you
You're gonna lose in time
Don't be afraid to show your friends
That you hurt inside, inside
Pain's part of life
Don't hide behind your false pride
It's a lie, your lie
[Chorus]
If you see me getting mighty
If you see me getting high
Knock me down
I'm not bigger than life
[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being untouchable
I'm not above the love
I'm part of you and you're part of me
Why did you go away
Finding what you're looking for
Can end up being being such a bore
I pray for you most every day
My love's with you now fly away
[Chorus][x5]
[Outro]
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely
It's so lonely when you don't even know yourself
It's so lonely

[Verse 1]
This is the place where all
The junkies go
Where time gets fast
But everything gets slow
[Verse 2]
Can I get some Vaseline
Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that
Which seems to be the making of a dream
[Bridge]
I don't want to do it
Like my daddy did
I don't want to give it
To my baby's kid
[Chorus]
"This is my calling", I said, my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
"Hammers are falling", I said, my darling
Shocking, appalling, all I can do to you
[Verse 3]
This is the place where all, the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene
Can I kiss your dopamine
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
I saw you out there yesterday, what did you want to say
A perfect piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray, what did you want to say
A master piece of DNA caught in a flashing ray
[Verse 5]
Can I smell your gasoline
Can I pet your wolverine
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate
Of love inside the atom split
[Outro]
I'm in a flash ray, a mash of DNA
Another popping Jay, who thinks
He's got something to say

[Verse 1]
Bang on my window if you want to get your look out
I felt the wind blow when she took her little book out
I'm steady loving on the lady of these pages
Another chapter if you will, so advantageous
[Bridge]
Down on the river tonight
Take off your glasses and fight
[Verse 2]
Under the heliomoon I'm going to pop the culture
Blue cherry dress on you is looking like a sculpture
This recreation is amusing and confusing
You never knew that it could feel so good while losing
What you lose, your virginity
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
Get so emotional
I got a notion for
And when a star gets bent
I'll be your parliament
I'll be your domino
Sit back and watch it flow
[Verse 3]
My intuition was a popping and a shaking
The very thought of it was all too much to take in
Curl up with lover we could lie out on the blanket
This canopy above I'll take the time to thank it
[Bridge]
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
I want to bury my face deep in your aroma
Her name is Lisa but they call her Desdemona
Come out and see me for some street communication
I think it's sweet of you to be my motivation
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
A wanna be gangster thinkin' he's a wise guy
Rob another bank, he's a sock 'em in the eye guy
Tank head, Mr. Bonnie and Clyde guy
Look him the eye, he's not my kinda guy
Never wanna be confusion proof
Pudding's sweet but too aloof
Orange eye girl with a backslide dew said
Yo homie who you talkin' to
A backed up paddywagon mackin' on a cat's ass
One uppercut to the cold upper middle class
Born to storm on boredom's face
And a little lust to the funky ass flea bass
Most in the race just lose their grace
The blackest hole in all of space
Crooked as a hooker, now suck my thumb
Anybody wanna come get some
[Hook]
If you have to ask
You'll never know
Funky motherfuckers
Will not be told to go
[Verse 2]
Don't ask me why I'm flyin' so high
Mr. Bubble meets superfly in my third eye
Searchin' for a soul bride, she's my freakette
Soak it up inside, deeper than a secret
Much more than meets the eye
To the funk I fall into my new ride
My hand my hand, magic on the one is a medicine man
Thinkin' of a few taboos that I ought to kill
Dancin' on their face like a stage on Vaudeville
I feel so good can't be understood
Booty of a hoodlum rockin' my red hood
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
And if I had a clue
I'd know exactly what to do
If I were the wiser of the two
And if I saw it all so clear
I'd write it down and bend your ear
If I were the clearer of the two
We could take a walk into the
Canyons of the Fifth Avenue
Sing and dance just to name a few
[Chorus]
All I do
All I do
[Verse 2]
And if I heard the Angels sing I'd
Sing it back to you and bring
Sound of heaven ringing just for you
And if I saw the sun fall down
I'd pick it up and make a crown
One that was a perfect fit for you
We could take a walk
Into the apple orchard by the school
We could make a little residue
We could find a place to stay
A secret little hide away
Spend a little time inside of you
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
All eyes[x2]
All eyes on you
[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 1]
There must be something in the way I feel
That she don't want me to feel
The stare she bares cut me, I don't care
You see so what if I bleed
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real
Verse 2]
A mountain never seems to have the need to speak
A look that shares so many seek
The sweetest feeling I got from you
The things I said to you were true
I could never change just what I feel
My face will never show what is not real
[Hook]
I could have lied I'm such a fool
My eyes could never never never keep their cool
Showed her and I told her how
She struck me but I'm fucked up now
[Verse 3]
But now she's gone yes she's gone away
A soulful song
That would not stay
You see she hides cause she is scared
But I don't care
I won't be spared
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Something inside the cards
I know is right
Don't want to live
Somebody else's life
This is what I want to be
And this is what I give to you
Because I get it free
She smiles while I do my time
[Chorus 1]
I could die for you
Oh, this life I choose
[Verse 2]
I'm here to be your only go-between
To tell you of the sights
These eyes have seen
What I really want to do is
Turn it into motion
Beauty that I can't abuse
You know that I'd use my senses to
You can see that
It's only everywhere
I'd take it all and then
I'd find a way to share
[Chorus 2]
Come along and go
Along with me
Wander with me, Yo
It's all for free
[Chorus 1]
I could die for you
What you wanna do
Oh, this life I choose
[Bridge]
Come again and tell me
Where you want to go
What it means for me
To be with you alone
Close the door and
No one has to know
How we are
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]

[Anthony Keidis]
40 detectives this week
40 detectives strong
Takin' a stroll down Love Street
Strollin' is that so wrong
Can I get my co-defendant
Hump de bump
Doop bodu
Bump de hump
Doop bop
Hump de bump
Doop bodu
Oh no!
Hump de bump
Doop bodu
Hump de bump
Doop bop
Bump de hump
Doop bodu
Bump bump
Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out
When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky? I'm
I'm wide awake now
Workin' the beat as we speak
Working the belle du monde
Believin' the havoc we wreak
Believin', is that so wrong
Can I get my co-dependent
Hump de bump
Doop bodu
Bump de hump
Doop bop

C'mon!
Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out
When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky? I'm
I'm wide awake now
Hump de bump

Oh no!
Bump de hump

Bump bump
Listen to me what I said
Try to get it through your head
A little bit of circumstance and
A chance to make out
Livin' in a citadel
It's hard enough to be yourself
Waiting for the bell to toll
And I am wide awake now
Must have been a hundred miles
Any of a hundred styles
It's not about the smile you wear
But the way we make out
When I was another loner
Nothin' but a two beach comber
Anybody seen the sky? I'm
I'm wide awake now
I'm wide awake now

[Verse 1]
People
Keep on learning
Soldiers
Keep on warring
World
Keep on turning
Because it won't be too long
Powers
Keep on lying
While your people
Keep on dying
World
Keep on turning
Because it won't be too long
[Chorus]
I'm so darn glad he let me try it again
Because my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew 
then
Going to keep on trying until I reach the highest ground
[Verse 2]
Teachers
Keep on teaching
Preachers
Keep on preaching
World, keep on turning
Because it won't be too long
Oh, no!
Lovers
Keep on loving
While believers
Keep on believing
Sleepers
Just stop sleeping
Because it won't be too long
Oh, no!
[Chorus]
[Outro]
And Stevie knows that, uh, nobody's going to bring me down
Until I reach the highest ground
Because me and Stevie, see, we're going to be sailing on the funky sound
Until I reach the highest ground
Busting out, and I'll break you out, because I'm sailing on
Until I reach the highest ground
Just, uh, sailing on, sailing on the higher ground
Until I reach the highest ground

[Intro]
Smile when I'm shy in ways, but I love
Everything of first impressions
Sweet successions
[Verse 1]
Been around for quite a while. I see you kept it versatile
Motivated to combine. Even when it's bad, it's fine
Did she say something that made you cry?
Have you lost it all--the big fall?
Oh, so slowly, comes back holy
[Chorus]
Bishop takes a knight, but I will put up quite a fight
Oh, here's your ham on rye
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me
Long progression's why
[Verse 2]
Set it off to collect knowledge. Quit a job, and go to college
All about the aftershock. Swedish, Latin, super Funk
Moses of Manhattan made it great
Pain we celebrate
And I love
The long progression, indiscretion
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
In between the reasons are the psychedelic seasons
Oh, simple as your stride
Information intimated, elegant and integrated
Sweep your floors with pride
Smile, cause it's all a ride--all supplied
And I love everything about this session and this long progession
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
In between the reasons are the psychedelic seasons
Oh, simple as your stride
Elementary, the chemistry means everything to me
The long progression's why

[Verse 1]
I used to shout across the room to you
And you'd come dancin' like a fool
Shuffle step, you funky mother
Come to me, all warm as covers
Rest with me, my lovely brother
For you see, there is no other
Memory so sad and sweet
I'll see you soon, save me a seat
[Hook]
Well I'm cryin'
Now my lovely man
Yes I'm cryin'
Now and no one can
Ever fill the
The hole you left my man
I'll see you later
My lovely man if I can
[Verse 2]
In my room, I'm all alone
Waiting for you to get home
Listen to 
Roberta Flack
But I know you won't come back
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Just in case you never knew
I miss you some
I love you too
See my heart
It's black and blue
When I die
I will find you
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
My friends are so depressed
I feel the question
Of your loneliness
Confide, because I'll be on your side
You know I will, you know I will
Ex-girlfriend called me up
Alone and desperate
On the prison phone
They want to give her 7 years
For being sad
[Chorus]
I love all of you
Hurt by the cold
So hard and lonely too
When you don't know yourself
[Verse 2]
My friends are so distressed
And standing on
The brink of emptiness
No words I know of to express
This emptiness
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Imagine me taught by tragedy
Release is peace
I heard a little girl
And what she said
Was something beautiful
To give your love
No matter what
[Chorus]

[Verse]
The crimson tide is flowing through your fingers as you sleep
The promise of a clean regime are promises we keep
Do you like it rough I ask and are you on to task?
The calicoes of Pettibon where cultures come to clash
[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear, the colors of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, and Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses tonight
[Bridge]
The clothes between my former queen, her legendary stare
The holy tears that I am in, the lovely cross to bear
[Chorus]
[Chorus 1]
Several of my best friends wear, the colours of the crown
And Mary wants to fill it up, and Sherry wants to tear it all back down, girl
The saviour of your light
The monarchy of roses
The monarchy of roses
[Chorus 2][x2]
Hey yeah
We all want the rose you know
I said
Hey yeah
Show us love before you go
Say I will, and then I say I want to
The story knows that I will never haunt you

[Pre-Chorus]
I change the key from C to D
You see to me it's just a minor thing,
 you all
He knows everything
To read just you've got to trust
That all the fuss is just a minor thing, you all
He knows everything
[Chorus]
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king
He knows everything
Ooh, oh oh
[Verse]
You've got your bit part, Mozart
Hot dart acceleration
Pop art, pistol chasing
Cat fight intimidation
Oh, oh, oh, oh
To read a mind you've got to
Redefine the line to make your circle sing, you all
He knows everything
You make a sound
The spell is bound to come around
It's just a minor thing, you all
He knows everything
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
All out interfacing
Black star motivation
Vampire, sugar junkie
Data basing infiltration
[Pre-Chorus]
[Outro]
It's just a minor thing
And I'm a minor king

[Verse 1]
Broke down, I found
Even when you think you need a rest
You will live to fight another round
I know its too bad, so sad
All the things that we could've been and could've had
[Chorus]
Hey girl, what sound
A million miles of water that are flowing deep beneath this ground
Now, I found you right here
A million miles of water
[Verse 2]
You were my muse
Just because you happen to have a bomb
Doesn't mean you light the fuse
I know that, my girl, big lie
Four years in and you never even said goodbye
[Chorus]
[Chorus 2]
Hey girl, what sound
I want you to remember that some times we have to go without
Now I found it right here
I want you to remember dear
[Verse 3]
We were two of a funny kind
So damn blind but now we got to never-mind
I know that this is the end, we tried
So hard, but now I got to lose a friend
[Chorus]
[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Things will never be the same
Still I'm awfully glad I came
Resonating in the shape of things to come
Never waiting when I know there's only one
Messed it up but rest assured
No one ever thinks they're cured
Just a minute while I reinvent myself
Make it up and then I take it off the shelf
[Pre-Chorus]
Over the laws of light
Over the moon by midnight
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
[Chorus]
Everyone knows anything goes
We are the lotus kids
Better take note of this
For the story
[Verse 2]
The rising moon is on the shine
The blood of Scorpios a nine
Like the fear that's in the eyes of every doe
Say it now cause John and Jane would like to know
Is it safe inside your head
Songs to serenade the dead
All along I said I know no enemies
Mix it up until there are no pedigrees
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Bridge]
Enter the rolling tide
Over the ocean so wide
Let's do it all this time
Everyone wishing well we go
[Chorus][x3]

[Verse 1]
I've got a mellowship, I've got a fellowship
I've got a nonstop "yo swan" hello chip
Born to adore the big bad bison
Thunderstorm and a man like Tyson
Popcorn peanuts lookin' at big butts
No I can not keep my mouth shut
Rockin' to the beat of the fabulous forum
My Lakers I adore 'em
Blush my lady when I tell her
The I do indeed love to smell her
Sopping wet your pink umbrella
Do the dog with Isabella
I'm so in love yes with an artist
Imagination, he's the smartest
, stroke and splatter
I attest to your gray matter
Living kings how true it rings
These are just a few of my favorite things
[Hook 1]
 where's my sleigh
Good God playing for days
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God purple haze
Good God the baddest of brains
Good God anyday now
Good God ridin' my sleigh now
[Verse 2]
Being that I'm the duke of my domain
My hat goes off to 
Singing a song about what true men don't do
Killing another creature that's kind of blue
Writing about the world of the wild coyote
Good man Truman Copote
Talking about my throughts 'cuase they must grow
Cock my brain to shoot my load
I'm on the porch cause I lost my housekey
Pick up my book I read Bukowski
Can I get another kiss from you
Kiss me right here on my tattoo
[Hook 2]
Good God where's my sleigh
Good God playing for days
Good God any day now
Good God take me away
Good God DeNiro's insane
Good God rackin' my brain
Good God anyday now
Good God take me away now take me away
[Verse 3]
Me my friends and the sex machine
Do unto others like my brother Bean
I know you've got a mother
So give her a hug
I know you've got a mother
With a whole lot of love
Billy sings and Basie swings
These are just a few of my favorite things

[Verse 1]
She's the one she's the only one
She's got ripped back light going to make me come
I say when I smile I'm a really smile
I got dreams so wide like a country mile
[Chorus 1]
I said now, I'll take it
It's better for you
Somehow we'll make it
Because that's what we do
[Verse 2]
Pick a star in the open sky
I see you see me and that is why I
Hop along to the cowboy beat
When I feel your fire jump up to meet
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Something out there where love is your only friend
And we are the ones that will make you feel better
And someone to spare when love is the only end
And we are the ones that will make you feel better, oh yeah
[Verse 3]
In a world that has run amok
I've got to set my sights just to get struck
I walk away from the rank and file
With a punched out mouth and a pack of style
I say she's the one she's the only one
Make me search myself until I'm done and
Tell me now in a telegram
Do the sea of stars make a diagram and
[Chorus 2]
Oh yeah hey hey
Oh yeah
[Verse 4]
So alive I arrive on dust, you can search
My mind for the red on rust I said
Take me there and she really cares
Lights up for me going to hear my prayers, I said
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Outro]
We are the ones that will make you feel better[x4]

[Verse 1]
Magpies on fire
Making love like little whirls on out the porch can lead to medicine
Oh well, I'm game for anything at all
Scarecrows are liars
Spins the yarn and no one ever checks it out to see if it was real
Sold you the moon and now it's time to fall
All along it's like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage, love
[Chorus]
What more do you want
How much more can you take
I love my mistakes
I've been here before
[Bridge]
All in all it's just the call of something wild beyond your room
There's a changing of the major chord
Your minor thread will do, love
[Verse 2]
My gun misfired, shot myself instead
I guess I always knew I'd be the one to lose
Light screen door slams, time to make a move
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
All along 
it's like a bird who trapped alone inside a cage, love
A bird who's born to live at half your age, girl
A bird who never really had a say
[Outro]
All along it's like a bird who's now been freed from someone's cage

[Chorus]
L.A. Lakers, fast break makers
Kings of the court, shake and bake all takers
Back to back is a bad-ass fact, a claim that remains in tact
[Verse 1]
M-A-G-I-C see you on the court
Buck has come to play his way and his way is to thwart
M-A-G-I-C magic of the buck
Other teams pray for dreams
But he doesn't give a [fuck]
Penetrating the lane like a bullet train
Comes the magic blood a telepathic brain
Knucklehead suckers better duck
When the buck comes through like a truck
Scott stops, pops and drops it in
On his way back, gets a little skin
From the hand of a man named A.C. Green
Slam so hard, break your TV screen
Worthy's hot with his tomahawk
Take it to the hole, make your mama talk
[Pre-Chorus]
I hate to burst your bubble, but triple double trouble
Is coming to your town and he's going to make rubble
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Lakers are the team that I watch on the telly
Because they've got more moves
Than a bowl full of jelly
The buck stops here, pops, then cheers
A roar through the Forum
That deafens my ears
The one and only know of his kind
Sits in a throne
Not for the records that he holds
But for being bald and bold
Kareem Abdul Jabbar
All-time great super, super star
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

You give me that funny feeling in my tummy
Ahhh shit, yeah, that's right, huh
Rollercoaster
Of Love
Say what?
Rollercoaster
Yeah (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh, baby, you know what I'm talkin' about
Rollercoaster of Love (love rollercoaster, child)
Oh, yeah, it's Rollercoaster time
Lovin' you is really wild
Oh, it′s just a love rollercoaster
Step right up and get your tickets!
Chorus:
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride, yeah (awawawawawaw)
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby
Baby I wanna ride, yeah
[Anthony Kiedis]
Move it over dad cause I'm a double-dipper
!
Upside down on the zip-zip-zipper
1,2,1,2,3, 
oh I′ve got a ticket so ride with me
Mary go down on the merry-go-round
All is fair on the fair ground
Love go slow, love go fast
Licorice twist gonna whip your ass
Rollercoaster
Of love
Say what?
Rollercoaster
Yeah (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Rollercoaster of love
Can you get off our love rollercoaster?
Chorus:
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride, yeah
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride
I will be there for you, I will be your man
[Anthony Kiedis]
Move over, dad, cause I'm a double dipper!
Upside down on the zip-zip-zipper
1,2,1,2,3, I′ve got a ticket so ride with me
Mary go down on the merry-go-round
All is fair on the fair ground
Love go slow, love go fast
Licorice twist gonna whip your ass
Rollercoaster
Of love
Say what?
Rollercoaster
Yeah (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Rollercoaster
Love rollercoaster, child
Lovin' you is really wild
Love love love love love love love love love love
Rollercoaster
Uhuh (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride, yeah (yeah, this here joker's the ride)
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride, (yes you do, yes you do, yes you do)
Your love is like (it’s like what?) a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride
Your love is like a Rollercoaster baby, baby
I wanna ride, (x10)

[Verse 1]
Stiff club, its my nature
Custom love is the nomenclature
Turn down mass confusion
Hit the road because we just keep cruisin'
Double my fun, double my vision
Long hard look at my last decision
Hustle here, hustle there
Hustle me bitch and you best beware
It's emotional and I told 
you
 so
But you had to know so I told you
Soft walk to horizon
One big crash that no one dies in
This for the folks in Fayetteville
It'll come true if you say it will
[Hook]
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
Look around, look around, look around
All around, all around, all around
It's emotional and I told you so
But you had to know so I told you
Please don't look right through me
Hurts my heart when you do that to me
Street lights out my window
City May breeze gonna stroke my skin though
Dropped a lot of words on an old brick wall
Rob a lot of banks got a pedigree scrawl
Put my peg into your square
Run around like we just don't care
[Hook]
[Bridge x4]
Move it ah got to get ya, want to get you
Move it ah got to get ya, going to get you
[Hook]
[Outro]
God I'm feeling small
And I'm hitting a wall
Gonna leave it all around

[Verse 1]
One shot all I need
I've got rhythm when I bleed
Until death do us part
Break my heart so I can start
Supercalifragilistic
Kiss me in the futuristic
Twisted but I must insist
It's time to get on top of this
[Chorus]
It's right on time [x7]
Looking fine, you're looking fine, get on 1999
Its right on time
[Verse 2]
Discard to bombard
Calling all you shooting stars
Holy cow, bow wow wow
Now I'm here I'm nowhere now
Joan of Arc reincarnated
Maybe we could be related
So much blood to circulate
And so much space to decorate
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Plain and simple pain
I want to but I can't complain
Death row let us go
It's time to blow up for the show
All the world reverberated
Coming through we motorcaded
Vibrate when we operated
Turning up in solid stated
[Outro]
Oh Lord!

[Chorus 1]
Readymade, readymade
Steady as the 
rhythm
 rolls
Readymade, readymade
And this is how the story goes
[Verse 1]
I've got a cousin making beats
Deep down in Arizona
We're going to rocket to Ramone's
In the city of Pomona, go
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
And if I give to you my second sight
You got it
And if I stay the course I'll stay the night
Come get it
[Chorus 3]
Readymade, readymade
Baby oughta celebrate
Readymade, readymade
And now it's time to deviate
[Verse 2]
I've got a sister making babies
With a black and decker blow torch
We're going to fop it all night
In the middle of the back torch, yeah
[Chorus 3]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 4]
Readymade, readymade
Rocking for the sake of Slade
Readymade, readymade
Listen but don't be afraid
[Verse 3]
I've got a brother making trouble
In the state of California
I wish I knew another way
But I'm going to have to clone you, hey
[Chorus 4]
[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Kick back a little bit just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure, I'm your punk
Going to bring the second bait that's not yet sunk
How I listen below when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish you were sober when you told me
That you were solid gold
[Verse 1]
Gravity-free is she, look at her
Hottest on the map she's full of anti-matter
You never look at very mellow impressions
Smell you with your going-to-hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it will probably not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how
Did I your lipstick on my kite
[Chorus 2]
I love this weather
It's the perfect storm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form
I love this weather
Because it keeps me warm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form
[Verse 2]
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind did a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terra-bulb is a soul
When she told me there is such a thing
Did you know that you glow when you go
From winter to the spring
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 3]
The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick gets strong
Mad boy, sad song
A wicked fate, but the sick gets strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
Got to fuse to bop for all day long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick gets
[Chorus 1]
[Outro]
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
I stand before you there's no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you

Kick back a little just to watch and see
Getting sick
er by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby,
 but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it were so when you told me
That you were solid gold
Gravity-free is she, look at her
Hottest on the map she's full of anti-matter
You never left a very mellow impression
Your Smell or your go to hell expression
Quixoticelixer might
But it will probably not fix your bite
Tell me now, tell me how
Did I get your lipstick on my kite
[Chorus]
I love this weather
It's the perfect storm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form
I love this weather
Cause it keeps me warm
Just keep it coming
In its perfect form
Everyday depression in a beautiful dress
Lady made a beautiful mess I guess
Dedicated mind did a medicated state
Is a highly overrated fate
Terrible is a soul
When she told me there is such a thing
Do you know that you glow when you go
From winter in to spring
[Chorus]
The madder the boy, the sadder the song
That's a wicked fate but the sick gets strong
Mad boy, sad song
A wicked fate, but the sick gets strong
Nobody's right and everyone's wrong
I refuse to punt on fourth and long
Mad boy, sad song
Wicked fate but the sick gets...
Kick back a little just to watch and see
Getting sicker by the minute with debauchery
Whatever your pleasure I'm your punk
On the brink of sinking baby, but not yet sunk
How I listened, low when you told me
That I was all you had to hold
I wish it was so when you told me
That you were solid gold
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you
I stand before you there's no curfew
I long to be inside your virtue
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
My heart is swollen when I search you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I swear to god I could not hurt you
I've got to be inside your virtue
I can't contain my urge to search you

To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Python power straight from Monty
Celluloid loves got a John Frusciante
Spread your head and 
spread the blanket
Shes too free and I'm the patient
Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
Up to my ass in alligators
Lets get it on with the alligator haters
Did what you did did what you said
Whats the point yo whats the spread
Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
Cause this is where I go
Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there
But I dont care
Cause this is what
I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
To finger paint is not a sin
I put my middle finger in
Your monthly blood is what I win
I'm in your house now let me spin
Feather light but you can't move this
Farley is an angel and I can prove this
Purple is a stain upon my pillow
Lets sleep weeping willow
Black and white a red and blue
Things that look good on you
And if I scream don't let me go
A purple stain I know
And if I call for you to stay
Come hit the funk on your way
It's way out there but I don't care
Cause this is where I go
Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood
With Dracula and Darla Hood
Unspoken words were understood
It's way out there
But I don't care
Cause this is what
I want to wear
Knock on wood we all stay good
Cause we all live in Hollywood

[Intro]
Aw!
[Chorus 1]
Police helicopter shot the sky
Police helicopter landing on my eye
Yeah!
[Chorus 2]
Police helicopter takes a nose-dive
Police helicopter, he is not shy
Yeah!
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Outro]
Aaw!

[Verse 1]
Say what you need to say
Make it clear
Make it great
Cause it's not too late
And there's no mistake
When you shine
Shake it for me anyway
Now we crash the gate
To investigate
Your fate
[Verse 2]
Pleasure to meet you
Got so much more
To offer the world
See what's in store
Stay all day
Someone to love
That's my boy chip chop
Open the doors
And we never close shop
Stay all day
[Verse 3]
And you shine as you redefine
Your time, just another time of day
Do you feel the spark
When you play the part?
Superstar
Fake it for me anyway
Time to tell them all
Without hem or haw
No applause
Tell them how to generate
How to raise the bar
How to keep it hard
To be alive, make it for me anyway
If you care at all
You will bare it all
You will grind, shake it for me anyway
Born to play the part
Dying for your art
Cause it's time
Take it for me anyway
You will clear the air
With a single stare
Your fate
[Verse 4]
Take what you need to take
To forsake
Make it for me anyway
When we fill the void
That is Pink As Floyd
To destroy
Records that we file away
And I clean the slate
As we calculate
Your fate

[Verse]
I'm a little pea
I love the sky and the trees
I'm a teeny, tiny little ant
Checking out this and that
And I am nothing
Ah, so you have nothing to hide
And I'm a pacifist
So I can fuck your shit up
Oh yeah, I'm small
Oh yeah, I'm small
Fuck you asshole
You homophobic, redneck dick
Big and tough and macho
You can kick my ass
[Outro]
So fucking what? [x4]

[Verse 1]
Deep inside of a parallel universe
It's getting harder and harder
To tell what came first
Under water where thoughts
Can breathe easily
Far away you were made
In a sea
Just like me
[Chorus]
Christ I'm a sidewinder
I'm a California King
I swear it's everywhere
It's everything
[Verse 2]
Staring straight up into the sky
Oh my my a solar system that fits
In your eye
Microcosm
You could die but your never dead
Spider web
Take a look at the stars in
Your head fields of space kid
[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 3]
Psychic changes are born in your heart
Entertain
A nervous breakthrough that makes us the same
Bless your heart girl
Kill the pressure it's raining on
Salty Cheeks
When you hear the beloved song
I am with you
[Chorus]

How long how long will I slide
Separate my side
, 
I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever
I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slittin' my throat It’s all I ever
Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I’m spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still her slut
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side, I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slittin' my throat
It’s all I ever
Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that
It’s not my friend
I tear it down I tear it down
And then it’s born again
How long how long will I slide
Separate my side I don’t
I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat
It’s all I ever
How long I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat
It’s all I ever

[Verse 1]
So we were down in Brazil and, man, that place is wild
We were in Rio de Janeiro, and uh, we had this, this sort of, uh
Security-guard type guy, and he was supposed to take us around and say hey
Could, you know, could you take us to the
The favelas and show us the prostitution and the drug deals and the night fights and the
You know, the street life of your town, and he said sure, so we, we pull up to this hooker
And she's wearing some kind of a, a bright green miniskirt, and it turns out it's a transsexual
And he says "Get over here!" and she comes over and she thinks she's busted, but she's not busted
Naw, she's not busted, he just wanted to smack her on the ass a few times and say "Hey, what's up, girl?"
[Chorus]
Get out of bed and I clear up my head and I don't want to go but I do it instead
We all dream within a dream
Get into bed and I turn off my head
And I﻿ started to float but I sunk when she said, "we're all dreams within a dream"
[Verse 2]
So I remember we got our driver's license, and 
my friend Hillel
 had this little Dodson, painted green, and...
Hollywood would get so crazy in the winter--the rains would come and the hills would just kind of melt down into the city lights
And, well, you know, we smoked weed and we'd go up in the hills and we'd listen to progressive rock music and just kind of trip out and...
Well, we would dream, you know, we would dream, and we would talk about what we wanted to do, and we would talk about girls and music
And, you know, Hillel wanted to be a rock star--I didn't even know what that was, I was like, whatever you want to do, man, I'm coming with you
I'm right with you, my friend
[Chorus]
(La la la...)
[Verse 3]
Why in the world would you want it to be--why would you want to take it so... so literally?
All these things that come down from the sky, raining upon your head, make you stop and wonder why--ah!
Can't they just spell it out, make it clear, make it easy to read for the simple man like me?
I don't think so
I reach out to my family and I say
It's not about religion and the God sitting in a chair in the sky with a punishing hand, oh
It's about heaven in your heart
Now when shall we start?
I wanna choose love instead of fear
Won't you come right now over here and be a part of my
(Ah)
This time
I love you

[Verse 1]
I've got myself in a masochistic hold
Why don't you let go?
Shake it off just to redirect my flow
Come on let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block
[Pre-Chorus]
Come again and tell me
What you're going through
Like a girl who only knew
Her child was due
[Chorus]
Memories
 of everything
Of lemon trees on Mercury
Come to me with remedies
From five or six of seven seas
You always took me with a smile when I was down
Memories of everything
That blew through
[Verse 2]
Looking up into a reverse vertigo
What an undertow
Give it up, another stubborn Scorpio
Come on, let's go
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block
[Pre-Chorus]
[Verse 3]
To the moon she gave
Another good review
Turn around and look at me
It's really, really you
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Sit up straight, I'm on a double date
I've got to find my way into the light, heavy, middle weight
We don't stop, rock around the clock
Motor-mouthing off in front of every other road block
[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 1]
I was riding
Riding on my bike
Me with my friend
We're so alike
[Chorus 1]
Am I all alone
[Verse 2]
She said all we
Have is this
We just had to stop
And share a kiss
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
One hot minute
And I'm in it come and get it [x3]
If I chase it
I might waste it
Come and 
get
 it
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
Sitting in the fire
Get along and have some fun
Floating to be higher
Maybe I'm your special one
Silent testifier
Breathe the moon
And eat the sun
Sitting in the fire
A tiny wink is all
All we have
No it's not much more
But don't get mad
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 4]
Close your eyes
And click your heels
Can you believe
How good it feels
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Outro]
Three lbs. of love
Inside my skull
A million more lives
It's never dull
Just a few times spun
Spun around the sun
A couple more or less
And then we're done

[Verse 1]
I am you are me
Good woman said you've got to believe
Submerge into the urge of we
Deliciously the mystery
[Chorus]
One big mob, oh yeah, oh yeah[x2]
Ek bara mala
, oh yeah, oh yeah[x2]
[Verse 2]
Ooze into into my noodle
East or west shepherd or poodle
Ladybug pine tree
To mingle with the bumblebee
A lover to the sun
And a brother to the cool breeze
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Scrawled upon the wall
Of a bathroom stall
A stranger wrote a note
That spoke to all
One, two, buckle my shoe
Take care of me
Because I might be you
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
We live in the city
We live in the jungle
It's time to be drinking
A thimble humble
Everything you ever see
Is never more than you and me
Give it on in to the beauty of the mystery
One big mob in one big home
A broken home
I'd like to share some air with you
Some air with you
A morning forest full of truths
The green is blue
The head that's getting pregnant lives
To give and give
What was I thinking in my head
The color red
Breaking hearts instead of bread
Something I said
Checkmated by frustration
Need to be cut loose
A different kind of being lost
A sullen cost
[Outro]
Pica-boo street
In Timbuktu
Do I need repeat
That a boy
Named Sue
Rocking to the beat
Of the kangaroo
Let me kiss your feet
And your forehead too

[Verse 1]
Standing on the corner of civilization
There's a time there's a place for me
In a world where I can't be found
Cold and mean people give me the creeps
Going to the jungle where the elephant roams
Got to get away, going to make it my home
Losing my taste for the human race
Social grace is a waste of time
It's absurd when I look around
So sublime that we blow my mind
Naked in the rain with a killer whale
I can taste the salt when I lick his tail
[Chorus]
Naked in the rain
Doctor Doolittle, what's your secret?
Give it to me doctor
Don't keep it
[Verse 2]
I never met an animal that I didn't like
You can come to me, I won't bite
Don't you know dog is man's best friend
There is some love that you can't fight
Naked in the rain with black tattoos
Running through the woods laughing at the blues
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Listen to the talking heart in my chest
With this gift, good Lord, I am blessed
There's a lump and it's in my throat
I'm in love with the wilderness
Naked in the river skinny-dipping my way
In the waterfall, I just want to play
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She's only 18
Don't like the Rolling Stones
She took the short cut
To being fully grown
She's got that mood ring
A little sister rose
The smell of Springsteen
A pair of panty hose
This talking picture show
Is leaking from a silhouette
She said 
"My man, you know
It's time to get your fingers wet"
Your hustle's busted
When you can't afford a cigarette
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "Handle it!"
[Hook]
Knock the world
Right off it's feet and straight onto it's head
The book of love
And I'll be laughing after you are dead
Fascinated by the look of you
And what was said
Make a play
For all the brightest minds in like will share
[Verse 2]
I heard some 
P-Funk
Out on the road again
To get your head shrunk
Is what I recommend
It's in your bloodline
A perfect Frankenstein
Out on that lone pine
I'm going to make you mine
It's understood
You wrapped your voodoo right around my neck
You've got some glitter
On your kitty at the discotheque
I put my loving in your oven now it's time to check
The last I heard from you
You were screaming "Resurrect!"
[Hook] x2

[Verse 1]
Looks to me like heaven sent
No lullaby kid, no five percent
Anyway you want to cut that cake
She's dying from the likes of abandonment
[Bridge]
Lost in the valley without my horses
She needs somebody to hold
[Pre-Chorus]
It looked to me like heaven
Sent this for your roughest night
She looks to me, she looked to me, all right
[Chorus]
Who's going to take you home
And hold you when things aren't so bright
She looks to me, she looked to me, all right
[Verse 2]
It's a long walk down those tracks
It's a dirty walk in, it's a dirty walk back
Going to learn a way too much
Shooting dope in the back of a Cadillac Jack
[Bridge]
Slow down the road to my back 40
She needs somebody to hold
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Down in the South seas
Give me your mouth please
Resuscitation
Is the way I found these
I give you major
You give me minor
Don't fade away
Like an ocean liner, now
Lost in the valley without my horses
No one can tell me what my remorse is
God made this lady that stands before me
She needs somebody to hold
She shows the world up with a smile
And then she throws the fight
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
Down on the bathroom floor
She's searching for another light
She looks to me, she looks to me, all right
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Verse]
Time to swing a little melody
To make you all feel something sexually
And now we're going to get it on in the groove
The groove that makes those smooth hips move
We are pumping that driving bad rhythm
To make those pretty little pussy lips schism
Kissum kissum kissum
In the mind is one design
To make you feel fine
Sucking on mine with a 69
I'm inclined to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck your brains out
For the moment, come on now, make her shout
Pump that leman 'till it pouts
Open your legs to the sensual sound
With the beauty of the beat on your pretty wet mound
I can tell you're like a horny bloodhound
Feel the bass, hug the ground
Just drop your knees and come unbound
And now you make your mouth to get on down
Our lust for notes will boil your blood
When they slither and slide on under your hood
Makin' me shoot my power packed pud
Like a wild lady loving a viable stud
Because of what is know as a juicy wet pud
Getting it getting it getting' it good
In my head, as a jellified hum
I take to rubbing her on the bum
Adjust the lips some on the tongue
With my thumb i strum her plum
Start to make her orgasm
Tastes a little bit like, ooh, how rum
[Outro]
Well i like to make her cum
To the rhythm of the drums
Make cum, make cum, cum

Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause
With the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
With the birds I'll share this lonely view
Push me up against the wall
Young Kentucky girl in a push-up bra
Fallin' all over myself
To lick your heart and taste your health cause
[Chorus]
Blood loss in a bathroom stall
Southern girl with a scarlet drawl
Wave good-bye to Ma and Pa
 cause
With the birds I'll share
[Chorus]
Soft spoken with a broken jaw
Step outside but not to brawl and
Autumn's sweet we call it fall
I'll make it to the moon if I have to crawl and
[Chorus]
Scar tissue that I wish you saw
Sarcastic mister know-it-all
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause
With the birds I'll share
[Chorus]

Dusting off your savior
Well, you were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand
To celebrate you is greater now that I can
Always my man
Now you see what I came for
No one here is to blame for, misunderstand
All in a hand
Just like you cause you made me all that I am
All in a hand
A butterfly that flaps its wings
Affecting almost everything
The more I hear the orchestra
The more I have something to bring
And now I see you
In a beautiful and different light
He's just a man
And any damage done will be all right
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior
Forgiving any behavior, he's just a man
All in a hand
Your hero's destined to waver, anyone can
Always my man
I would never betray you
Look at me who could raise you, face in the sand
Safe in your hand
You were always my favorite, always my man
All in a hand
We are the red hots
And we're loving up the love-me-nots
The flowers in your flower pots
Are dancing on the table tops
And now I see you
In a beautiful and different light
He's just a man
And everything he does will be alright
Call out my name
Call and I came
Dusting off your savior
The life that you have narrated, you were my man

[Verse 1]
I got more love than anything else
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health
Struck by the notion that it just might be
A method to the madness that I cannot see
[Verse 2]
Suffering for the freedom of a roughed up soul
Forty-two years young is a little bit old
Boy named Sue sing a Tennessee tune
Got buffalo love living on the moon
[Chorus]
Save this lady for me
[Verse 3]
Call me Alabama, I'm a Seminole prize
Got Time Square hair and a bedroom eyes
Keystone cops and the billy bob chops
Gonna scare my kids gonna share my crops
[Verse 4]
Vampire blood and a baseball glove
Just a little bit of what the girl is made of
National crash into the big lampoon
With a creature coming up from the black lagoon
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Losing ground true sounds of levity
The forest of the north might hold the key
[Verse 5]
Rocking to the rhythm of a ragtime band
Black flag wave on on my truck my man
Blasting for jones and the great unknowns
Got cheap cologne 
seventy-six trombones
[Verse 6]
Looking for the lady that won't be afraid
When heaven needs a hammer gotta get things made
I got more love than anything else
But a Jezebel spirit gonna steal my health
[Chorus]

[Intro]
History's so strong[x4]
[Verse 1]
Thinking of a drinking song the honkytonk will do
Making another breaking bone your favorite ingenue
This the distant dawn[x2]
I pu
t my cards upon the ta
ble
I do this beacause I am able
One picks is broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down
[Chorus]
Stay all night
We save the population
Stay all night
We save the population
Stay all night
We save the population
Stay all night
We save the population
[Instrumental Bridge]
[Verse 2]
Pistol and it's pawn
Sailing through the lexicon
A pistol and it's pawn
Blood on borderlines be drawn
Take another bottle down the brothel and the shrew
Make another awful sound to rap the gothic through
History's so strong[x2]
I put my cards upon the table
I do this because I am able
One picks is broken-down devotion
I threw my pistol in the ocean
Eyes wide with revelation
Shine at the police station
And when the verdict comes round
I'm sure that you will go down
[Chorus][x4]

Road trippin’ with my two favorite allies
Fully loaded we got snacks and supplies
It’s time to leave this town
It’s time to steal away
Let’s go get lost
Anywhere in the U.S.A
Let’s go get lost
Let’s go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty
West of the one
Sparkles light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
So much as come before those battles lost and won
This life is shining more forever in the sun
Now let us check our heads
And let us check the surf
Staying high and dry’s
More trouble than it’s worth
In the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
In Big Sur we take some time to linger on
We three hunky dory’s got our snakefinger on
Now let us drink the stars
It’s time to steal away
Let’s go get lost
Right here in the U.S.A
Let’s go get lost
Let’s go get lost
Blue you sit so pretty
West of the 
one
Sparkles light with yellow icing
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
Just a mirror for the sun
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
These smiling eyes are just a mirror for
Your smiling eyes are just a mirror for

[Verse 1]
Deep inside these sleeping shallows
Far away where no one goes, now
Take my place in golden space
Of TV star that no one knows, now
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world
[Chorus]
I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
Part of my scenery
What I belong to is your ecstasy
Rivers Of Avalon
Your faith unwavering is key
[Verse 2]
The clone of my own loneliness has got to fade
What am I known to?
Little garland and in your starling
Loving waves that I've succumbed to
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant adulation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world
[Bridge]
Deep, deep mystery is talking to me
She's a giver of constant animation
All around and ready to make a new formation
You're the reason I'm in this world
[Chorus]
[Outro]
I don't believe in everything I see
Rivers Of Avalon
Your supernatural energy
All that it means

Waking up dead, inside of my head
Would never, never do, there is no med
No medicine to take
I've had a chance to be insane
Asylum from the falling rain
I've had a chance to break
It’s so bad, it’s got to be good
Mysterious girl misunderstood
Dressed like a wedding cake
Any other day and I might play
A funeral march for Bonnie Brae
Why try and run away?
[Chorus]
Slow cheetah come before my forest
Looks like it's on today
Slow cheetah come, it's so euphoric
No matter what they say
I know a girl, she worked in a store
She knew not what her life was for
She barely knew her name
They tried to tell her, she would never be
As happy as a girl in a magazine
She bought it with her pay
[Chorus]
Everyone has so much to say
They talk, talk, talk their lives away
Don’t even hesitate
Walking on down to the burial ground
It’s a very old dance with a merry old sound
Looks like it's on today
[Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
A long, long, long, long time ago
Before the wind, before the snow
Lived a man, lived a man I know
Lived a freak of nature named Sir Psycho
Sir Psycho Sexy that is me
Sometimes I find I need to scream
[Bridge]
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
[Verse 2]
Deep inside the garden of Eden
Standing there with my hard on bleedin'
Theres a devil in my dick and some demons in my semen
Good God no that would be treason
Believe me Eve she gave good reason
Booty looking too good not to be squeezin'
Creamy beaver hotter than a fever
I'm a givin' cause she's the reciever
I won't and I don't hang up until I please her
Makin' her feel like an over achiever
I take it away for a minute just to tease her
Then I give it back a little bit deeper
[Hook]
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (he's the man that I met 1 time)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (he's the man that left me blind)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah (he's the man he's the man he's the man)
Sir Psycho, Sir Psycho, yeah
[Bridge]
He's a freak of nature
But we love him so
He's a freak of nature
But we let him go
[Verse 3]
I got stopped by a lady cop
In my automobile
She said get out and spead your legs
And then she tried to cop a feel
That cop she was all dressed in blue
Was she pretty? Boy I'm tellin' you
She stuck my butt with her big black stick
I said "what's up?" now suck my dick
Like a ram getting ready to jam the lamb
She whimpered just a little w
hen she felt my hand
On her crotch so very warm
I could feel her getting wet through her uniform
Proppin' her up on the black and white
Unzipped and slipped "ooo that's tight"
I swatted her like no swat team can
Turned a cherry pie right into jam
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
Hello young woman that I love
Pretty punk rock mamma that I'm thinking of
Hold me naked if you will
In your arms in your legs in your pussy I'd kill
To be with you, to kiss with you, I do miss you
I love you
[Bridge]
Lay me down, lay me down, lay me down
Descending waves of graceful pleasure
For your love there is no measure
Her curves they bend with subtle splendor
[Verse 5]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the funk will make me freak
If I should die before I waked
Allow me Lord to rock out naked
Bored by the ordinary time to take a trip
Calling up a little girl with a bull whip
Lickety split go snap "snap"
Girl gettin' off all in my lap
The tallest tree the sweetest sap
Blowin' my ass right off the map
Ooh and it's nice out here
I think I'll stay for a while

Come to decide that the things that I tried
Were in my life just to get high on
When I sit alone come get a little known
But I need more than myself this time
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe it, we rely on
When I lay it on come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
[Chorus]
Hey oh
, 
listen what I say, oh
I got your hey oh, now listen what I say, oh
When will I know that I really can't go
To the well once more time to decide on
When it's killing me, when will I really see
All that I need to look inside
Come to believe that I better not leave
Before I get my chance to ride
When it's killing me, what do I really need
All that I need to look inside
[Chorus]
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
And it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
When to descend to amend for a friend
All the channels that have broken down
Now you bring it up, I'm gonna ring it up
Just to hear you sing it out
Step from the road to the sea to the sky
And I do believe what we rely on
When I lay it on, come get to play it on
All my life to sacrifice
[Chorus]
The more I see, the less I know
The more I like to let it go
Hey oh, whoa
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
In between the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
I said hey, hey yeah, oh yeah, tell my Love now
Hey, hey yeah, oh yeah, tell my Love now
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Privately divided by a world so undecided
And there's nowhere to go
Deep beneath the cover of another perfect wonder
Where it's so white as snow
Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go
I said hey, oh yeah, oh yeah, tell my love now
Hey, hey yeah, oh yeah

I got a bad disease
Up from my brain is where I bleed
Insanity it seems
Is got me by my 
soul to squeeze
Well all the love from me
With all the dying trees I scream
The angels in my dreams
Have turned to demons of greed
That's mean
[Chorus]
Where I go, I just don't know
I got to, got to, gotta take it slow
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna give you some of my good time
Today love smiled on me
It took away my pain, said please
All that you had to free
You gotta let it be
Oh yeah
[Chorus]
You're so polite indeed
Well I got everything I need
Oh make my days a breeze
And take away my self destruction
It's bitter baby and it's very sweet
I'm on a rollercoaster but I'm on my feet
Take me to the river, let me on your shore
I be coming back baby, I be coming back for more
Doo doo doo doo dingle zing a dong bone
Ba-di ba-da ba-zumba crunga cong gone bad
Like an apple gift but i went out and never said my pleasures
I'm much better but I won't regret it never
[Chorus]
Where I go I just don't know
I might end up somewhere in Mexico
When I find my piece of mind
I'm gonna keep it for the end of time

[Verse 1]
Bells around St. Petersburg
When I saw you
I hope I get what you deserve
And this is where I find
Smoke surrounds your perfect face
And I'm falling
Pushing a broom
 out into space
And this where I find the way
[Chorus]
The Stadium Arcadium
A mirror to the moon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
State of the art
Until the clouds come crashing
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
Pushing myself
And no I don't mind asking
Now
[Verse 2]
Alone inside my forest room
And it's storming
I never thought I'd be in bloom
But this is where I start
Derelict days and the stereo plays
For the all night crowd
That it cannot phase
And I'm calling
Tedious weeds that the media breeds
But the animal gets what the animal needs
And I'm sorry
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
And this is where I find
Rays of dust that wrap around
Your citizen
Kind enough to disavow
And this is where I stand
[Chorus] [x2]
[Verse 4]
Stranger things have happened
Both before and after noon (before and after noon)
Well I'm forming and I'm warming
To you

[Verse 1]
Driving around, I've got my baby and my top down
Mary-go-round I ride you for my love
Throwing me down in the backseat underground
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
Who are you talking to?
Talk to me you sound of music
Making my way, I break another L.A. day
Time in the town I need it for my love
My Chevrolet rolling to another play day
This is the sound I listen for my love
[Chorus]
Who are you talking to? Talk to me you
Sound of music
Who are you talking to? Talk to me you
Sound of music
I love you, swim through me
Good feelings, come to me
[Verse 2]
Sought and I found a life of making my blood-sound
Do anything for the one I love
Something profound, the face of God is in Sensurround
I'm on the mound I make it for my love
[Chorus]

[Chorus]
Hot tamales and they're red hot, yes, she got them for sale
Hot tamales and they're red not, yes, she got them for sale
[Verse 1]
I got a girl, says she long and tall
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall
[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 2]
You know the monkey, now the baboon's playing in the grass
Well, the monkey stuck his finger in that old "Good Gulf Gas," now
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
She got two for a nickel, got four for a dime
Would sell you more, but they aren't mine
[Chorus][x2]
[Outro]
I'll due to break away your liver and dare your heart to beat about my
Hot tamales because they're red hot, yes, they got them for sale, I mean
Yes, she got them for sale, yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't rest in war
Will you be my friend
Dark Ages never change
I can't comprehend
Kiss me we self destruct
Can you hear me Lord
Yes I think we're fucked
But I can't rest in war
[Hook]
The righteous and the wicked, war and peace
The killing fist of the human beast
P.O.P - Prodigies Of Peace
Hear me when I'm calling you from my knees
I am playing for a better day
[Verse 2]
Holy mother earth
Crying into space
Tears on her pretty face
For she has been raped
Killing your future blood
Fill her with disease
Global abortion please
That is what she needs
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Are we fire flies
Flashing in the night
Big thunder rumble fish
Did you get it right
Headstrong battle song
Exploding souls be gone
Marvin Gaye my love
Where did we go wrong
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I've got a soul that can not sleep
At night when something just ain't right
Blood red, but without sight
Exploding egos in the night
Mix like sticks of dynamite
Red black or white, this is my fight
Come on courage, let's be heard
Turn feelings into words
American equality has always been sour
An attitude I would like to devour
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
[Hook]
The power of equality
Is not yet what it ought to be
It fills me up like a hollow tree
The power of equality
[Verse 2]
Right or wrong, my song is strong
You don't like it, get along
Say what I want, do what I can
Death to the message of the Ku Klux Klan
I don't buy supremacy
Media chief, you menance me
The people you say cause all the crime
Wake up motherfucker and smell the slime
Blackest anger, whitest fear
Can you hear me, am I clear
My name is peace, this is my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I've got tapes
I've got c.d.'s
I've got my Public Enemy
My lilly white ass is tickled pink
When I listen to the music that makes me think
Not another motherfuckin' politician
Doin' nothin' but something for his own ambition
Never touch the sound we make
Soul sacred love, vows that we take
To create straight what is true
Yo he's with me and what I do
My name is peace, this my hour
Can I get just a little bit of power
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
Madder than a motherfucker, lick my finger
Can't forget
, cause the memory lingers
Count 'em off quick, little piccadilly sickness
Take me to the hick, eat my thickness
I've got a welt from the Bible belt
Dealing with the hand that I've been dealt
Sitting in the grip of a killing fist
Giving up blood just to exist
Rub me wrong and I get pissed
No I can not get to this
People in pain, I do not dig it
Change of brain for Mr. Bigot
Little brother do you hear me
Have a heart oh come get near me
Misery is not my friend
But I'll break before I bend
What I see is insanity
Whatever happened to humanity

Lipstick junkie be funky all he wanty
She came back wearing a smile
Look-alike someone drug me
They wanted to unplug me
No one in here is on trial
Its just a turn-around
And we go
Oh
Well and we go
Oh oh oh oh
Tic-toc, I want to rock you like the 80s
Cock-blocking isn’t allowed
Tugboat Shiela is into memorabilia
Who said three is a crowd?
We better get it on the go
[Chorus]
Hey, now
We’ve gotta make it rain somehow
She told me to
And show me what to do
Oh Maggie makes it in her cloud
[Chorus]
She knows how, to make it loud
Rain dance Maggie advances to the final
Who knew that she had the goods?
Little did I know her body was one delicious vinyl
To your neck of the woods
I want to lick a little bit
[Chorus]
You got the wrong girl
But not for long girl
Its in a song girl
Cos I’ll be gone girl
[Chorus]
I said
Hey now
I want to rock this Valley crowd
She told me to
And told me what to do
She knows how to make it loud
But not for long girl
Its in a song girl
Cos I’ll be gone bye bye yeah
Bye bye girl
Bye bye
Girl
Bye bye
Girl
Bye bye

[Verse 1]
They come from every state to find
Some dreams were meant to be declined
Tell the man what did you have in mind
What have you come to do?
No turning water into wine
No learning while you're in the line
I'll take you to the broken sign
You see these lights are blue
Come and get it
Lost it at the city limit
Say goodbye, cause they
Will find a way to trip it
Everybody's looking for a silly gimmick
Got to get away
Can't take it for another minute
This town is made of many things
Just look at what the current brings
So high it's almost promising
This place was made on you
[Chorus]
Tell me baby
What's your story?
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
Tell me lover
Are you lonely?
The thing we need is never all that hard to find, oh
Tell me baby
What's your story
Where you come from
And where you want to go this time, oh
You're so lovely
Are you lonely?
Giving up on the innocence you left behind
[Verse 2]
Some claim to have the fortitude
Too shrewd to blow the interlude
Substaining pain to set the mood
Step out to be renewed
I'll move you like a baritone
Jungle brother's on the microphone
Getting over with the undertone
It's time to turn to stone
 baby
When your nose is in the 
Life can be a 
But life can be a little shitty
What a pity
Boston and a 
Looking for a hundred
But you only ever found a fifty
Three fingers in the honeycomb
You ring just like a xylophone
Devoted to the chromosome
The day that you left home
[Chorus] x2

My mouth fell open
Hoping that the truth
Would not be true
Refuse the news
I'm feeling sick now
What the fuck am I
Supposed to do
Just lose and lose
First time I saw you
You were sitting
Backstage in a dress
A perfect mess
You never knew this
But I wanted badly for you to
Requite my love
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so
I liked your whiskers
And I liked the
Dimple in your chin
Your pale blue eyes
You painted pictures
Cause the one
Who hurts
Can give so much
You gave me such
Left on the floor
Leaving your body
When highs are the lows
And lows are the way
So hard to stay
Guess now you know
I love you so

[Verse 1]
Flat on my back
In a lonely sprawl
I stare at the ceiling
Because I cannot fall
Asleep tonight
No, not at all
Head lights flash
Across my bedroom wall
Crying eyes open
Because I cannot fall
In love with you
No, not at all
[Chorus]
Walk away and taste the pain
Come again some other day
Aren't you glad you weren't afraid
Funny how the price gets paid
[Verse 2]
Busted in two
Like a brittle stick
I cannot drink
Because my throat constricts
Love-sick from you
That will never do
Open my mouth
I couldn't make a sound
I could not scream
I could not shout
It out to you
Nothing to do
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
This may come as a shocking surprise
I have to take a walk
I have to kiss it goodbye
Goodbye, my love[x2]
I am not alive
[Chorus]

In enemies hands I don't have to measure
I don't have to measure
In enemies hands I don't have to measure
I don't have to measure up
And I've seen a million eyes at once, staring as one
You are the apple of my life
There's no one but you in the world i'd choose
You are what carries dark to light
There is no excuse for being untrue
In every sound is an above and below unfound
The dance they do we all feel
Above and below sensory input are two lovers disconnected by us
So we have to join them in our actions
We are the center of what one wants
You are the apple of my life
There's no one but you in the world i'd choose
You are the sum and whole of life
There is no one in the world but you and I
You connect the earth to the sky
And nothing comes between us
Our bodies or minds
Nothing disconnects us
Nor silence or time

[Verse 1]
Should of been, could of been, would of been dead
If I didn't get the message goin' to my head
I am what I am
Most motherfuckers don't give a damn
Aw baby think you can
Be my girl, I'll be your man
Someone full of fun
Do me 'till I'm well done
Little Bo Peep, cumin' from my stun gun
Beware, take care
Most motherfuckers have a cold ass stare
Aw baby please be there
Suck my kiss cut me my 
share
[Hook]
Hit me you can't hurt me, suck my kiss
Kiss me please pervert me, stick with this
Is she talking dirty
Give to me sweet sacred bliss
Your mouth was made to suck my kiss
[Verse 2]
Look at me can't you see
All I really want to be
Is free from a world that hurts me
I need relief
Do you want me girl to be your theif
Aw baby just for you
I'd steal anything that you want me to
K-i-s-s-i-n-g
Chicka chicka dee
Do me like a banshee
Low brow is how
Swimming in the sound of bow wow wow
Aw baby do me now
Do me here I do allow
[Hook]
[Repeat 1st Verse]

[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh oh yeah

Arthur J. did indicated
The boulevard would never be

I lose the way I am

Please don't strip my mind
Leave something behind
Please don't strip my mind

El Dorado won the lotto
All that cash and not a clue
But now you know what I've been through
(Yeah)

[Chorus]

Oh, good God, Heaven Almighty, Heaven's to murder Troy
We've got a cataclysmic situation developing

Oh no, oh no, it's getting worse, worse by the minute
We're down here in division in mystery
Someone send for back up
Every other day you say your gonna have to bury 'em
Famous last words from the Laysarium
You say you sent a record saying something 'bout my love
You can take the A train but your gonna have to lie low

[Verse 1:]
Can I get your hand to write on
Just a piece of leg to bite on
What a night to fly my kite on
Do you want to flash a light on
Take a look it's on display ... for you
Coming down, no not today
Did you meet your fortune teller
Get it off with no propeller
Do it up it's on with Stella
What a way to finally smell her
Picking up but not too strong ... for you
Take a piece and pass it on
[Hook:]
Fly away on my zephyr
I feel it more than ever
And in this perfect weather
We'll find a place together
Fly on . . . my wind
[Verse 2 :]
Rebel and liberator
Find a way to be a skater
Rev it up to levitate her
Super friendly aviator
Take a look it's on display
For you . . . coming down no not today
[Hook:]
[Verse 3:]
In the water where I center my 
emorion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We'll find a place together
[Hook:]
[Verse 4:]
In the water where I center my emotion
All the world can pass me by
Fly away on my Zephyr
We're going to live forever

[Verse 1]
All the creatures on the beaches
Making waves in a motion picture
Won't you keep this in between us?
Search and seizure wake up Venus
The dollar bill will mentally ill bill
Mom and dad take your 'Don't be sad pill'
Turn the screw and twist my language
Don't forsake me I'm contagious
[Chorus 1]
There's a reason for the 21st century
Not too sure but I know that it's meant to be
And that it's meant to be
Come on, ooh
[Bridge]
It's my favorite combination
Coming down with the favored nations
Deep rotation, mutilation
Learn to give and take dictation
[Chorus 2]
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Like the Cain and Abel
Oh, oh oh, oh oh
Time to run this table
[Chorus 1]
[Bridge]
Read me your scripture and
Read me your scripture
Read me your scripture and I will twist it
Show me your wrist and I
Show me your wrist and
Show me your wrist and I'll kiss it kiss it
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 2]
Simple soldier hand it over
Stop and read what you just wrote her
Strangulation, altercation
Oral sex and bird migration
[Chorus 1][x2]

[Verse]
On a far away island
Of Salamasond
Yertle the turtle
Was king of the pond
A nice little pond
It was clean it was neat
The water was warm
There was plenty to eat
Until one day
The king of them all
Decided the kingdom
He ruled was too small
I'm a ruler of all that I see
But I don't see enough
And that's the trouble with me
With this stone for a throne
I am too low down
I cannot look down
Upon the places beyond
So Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
And Yertle the turtle king
Lifted his hand
He ordered all the turtles
Onto one another's back
He piled them high
Into a ten turtle stack
I'm Yertle the turtle
The things I now rule
I'm king of a cow
I'm king of a mule
Then down from below
In the great turtle stack
Came a burp from a plain
Little turtle named Mack
Just part of the throne
This burping' little turtle
Looked up and said "I beg
Your pardon king Yertle"
I've pains in my back
My shoulders and my knees
How long must we stand
Here your majesty
"Silence !" the king of the
Turtles barked back
To the bad burping
Little turtle named Mack
I'm Yertle the turtle
Oh marvelous me for
I am ruler of all that I see
[Outro]
Yertle, Yertle the turtle[x2]

My shadow side, so amplified
Keeps coming back dissatisfied
Elementary, son, but it's so
My love affair with everywhere
Was innocent Why do you care?
Someone start the car, time to go
You're the best I know
My sunny side has up and died
I'm betting that when we collide
The universe will shift into a low
The travesties that we have seen
Are treating me like Benzedrine
Automatic laughter from a pro
My, what a good day for a, walk outside
I'd like to get to know you a little better, baby
God knows that I really tried
My, what a good day for a, take out bride
I'd like to say we did it for the better of
I saw you there so unaware
Those hummingbirds all in your hair
Elementary, son, but it's so
The disrepair of Norma Jean
Could not compare to your routine
Balarama beauty goin' toe to toe
My, what a good day for a, let it slide
I'd like to say we did it for the better of
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter, yeah
Right on the verge, just one more dose
I'm traveling from coast to coast
My theory isn't perfect, but it's close
I'm almost there, why should I care?
My heart is hurting when I share
Someone open up, let it show
My, what a good day for a walk outside
I'd like to think we did it for the better of
I thought about it and I brought it out
I'm motivated by the lack of doubt
I'm consecrated, but I'm not devout
The mother, the father, the daughter
Oh, you don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do, yeah
You don't form in the wet sand
You don't form at all
Woah, you don't form in the wet sand
I do, yeah

[Verse 1]
My tendency
For dependency
Is offending me
It's upending me
I'm pretending see
To be strong and free
From my dependency
It's warping me
So much love
So rare to dare
Afraid of
Ever being there
Take me home
I need repair
Take me please
To anywhere
[Chorus]
Descend
All the way
All the way
Everyday
Warped
And scared
Of
Being
There
[Verse 2]
Descended from
Demented men
Struggle with
The art of Zen
Please don't look
Too close at me
You might not like
What you see
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Night craving
Sends me crawling oh
Beg for mercy
Does it show
A vacancy
That's full of holes
Hold me please
I'm feeling cold
[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
Shiver for me girl
Deliver for me my darling
Pushing up to you
A river that runs right through you
Swim for your smile in a blue rock quarry
Make it for me baby, you won't be sorry
Shiver for me now
Deliver for me my darling
[Chorus]
Miles and miles of nether worlds I roam
Settle for love you're never far from home
Carry me down into the waters of
Carry me down into the waters of love
Two of us were made of angel's dust
I've been around
But not around enough
[Verse 1]
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep warm
Quiver for me girl
Give me your head and shoulders
Shot from the pages of love and glory
Sleeping next to you and I'm in your story
Shadow my free form
A woman that I could keep 
warm
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Let's go
I know I make it for two
Intuition's only what you take from it
I know, I make it for two
You were there and I was fortunate
I know I make it for two
Messy bed a part of cheating I won't fall for you
I know I make it for two
I make it for two
I make it for two and
[Pre-Chorus]
[Outro]
Settle for love [x3]

[Verse 1]
Warlocks in Wonderland
I've got to megatropolis in my hand
And a subterranean marching band
Making noise for the boys in the Vatican
And a
A little package and off we go
Oh ticky ticky tackita tic tac toe
I know everybody's Eskimo
We've got another thing coming
And that's our show well
[Pre-Chorus]
Every night I go looking for you
Every one in the world adores you
A little pocket of something kind
To find your reason
[Chorus]
Coming up on it everyday for
Look at me and it's what I stay for
A little locket of fantasy
That we believe in
[Verse 2]
Lilacs and contraband
I've got Santa Monica in my hand
A little Beatlemania when I can
And I've got two big bags of old Japan
Ring side and blow by blow
Another main event at the old rainbow
We're coming right on top of the tupelo
When she looks just like Brigitte Bardot
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Make a deal with Uncle Weezer
Sign your name to claim
China Chow will try to please her
Sweetness came from Jane
Warlocks in Wonderland
I've got a Rockapotomus in my hand
With a happy ending that's made of sand
With a little bit of loving is all I can
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
And that ain't hard
Just me and my own two feet, in the heat
I got myself to meet
A detective of perspective
I need to try and get a bigger eye
Open wide
Bloodwood flowers in my gaze
Walkabout in the sunny days
Do me now
On a walkabout
You can do it in the city, you can do it in a zone
You can do it in a desert
You can do the unknown
On a walkabout
High desert skies are what I spy
So fly, you gotta wonder why, hm
The stingrays must be fat this year
Are moving slow in my lowest gear
The didgeridoo original man with a dream
I believe the Aborigine
On a walkabout
You could do it with a shuffle, you could do it with a stroll
You could do it with a stride
You could do the unknown
On a walkabout
A walk could cure most all my blues
Bare feet or in my two shoes
One...two...
I think I'll go on a walkabout
And find out what it's all about
Can't hurt to try
Use your legs to rock it wide
Take a ride to the other side

[Verse 1]
Does it go from east to west, you all
Body free and a body less, you all
Come again just to start afresh and
Once again to find a home
In the moment of the meantime
Dropping in coming through the mesh, you all
Checking in just to get it blessed, you all
Hard to leave when it's picturesque and
Find a form that's free to roam
[Chorus 1]
Where you come from
Where you're going
Where you come from
Where you're going
[Verse 2]
Do it all then it all again, you all
Make it up and you make a friend, you all
Paddle on just around the bend and
Find a place where you can see
All the mamas and the papas
Take a chance on a recommend, you all
Hard as hell just to comprehend, you all
Disbelief that I do suspend and
Easy now to find a breeze
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
We all want to tell her
Tell her that we love her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever seen
We all want to kiss her
Tell her that we miss her
Venice gets a queen
Best I've ever
I know you said you don't believe in God
We used to disagree
Now that it's time for you to leave
[Chorus 2]
G-L-O-R-I-A
Is love, my friend
My friend, my friend
[Verse 4]
Your stylish mess of silver hair
A woman of your kind is rare
Your uniform returns to air
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 5]
And now it's time for you to go
You taught me most of all I know
Where would I be without you, Glo?
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 6]
I see you standing by the sea
The waves you made will always be
Your kiss goodbye before you leave
[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
I saw your face
Elegant and tired
Cut up from the chase
Still I so admire
Blood shot your smile
Delicate and wild
Forgive me 
she was styled
Rip right through
 me
[Pre-Chorus]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her, I got her on my mind
Nothing better, the feeling is so fine
Simply put, I saw your love stream flow
[Chorus]
Come on baby, because there's no name for
Give it up and I got what I came for
Universally speaking
I take it back and you make me nervous
Nothing better than love and service
Universally speaking
I went in the long run
[Verse 2]
I saw your crying
Dying to get high
Two of a kind
It's our hands tonight
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Silveretta, the jets of a lifetime
Go and get her I got her on my mind
All the better the feeling it goes fine
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Simply put I saw your love stream flow
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angels
Lonely as I am, together we cry
I drive on her streets cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses the windy
Well, I never worry, now that is a lie
[Chorus]
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don't ever wanna feel like I did that day
But take me to the place I love, take me all the way
, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
It's hard to believe that there's nobody out there
It's hard to believe that I'm all alone
At least I have her love, the city, she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry
[Chorus]
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Love me, I say, yeah yeah
One time
[Verse 3]
Under the bridge downtown
Is where I drew some blood
Under the bridge downtown
I could not get enough
Under the bridge downtown
Forgot about my love
Under the bridge downtown
I gave my life away
Yeah yeah yeah
Oh, no, no, no, yeah yeah
Where I stay

[Verse 1]
I was walking through a courtyard
Without shoes and
Without regard
Automatic catacombs
Take me where I wanna go
[Pre-Chorus]
All around
All in 
faces
It astounds
And amazes
Good to last in natural
Touch me I'm a chromosome
[Chorus 1]
What time
Fascinated by the face of time
What time
I got it to give and now we're going to make some time
[Chorus 2]
Ultra-fine and ultralistic
Can I spy into the mystic
System down for infiltration
Open mind free of frustration
[Verse 2]
I was driving
To a safe place
And arriving
As I retraced
Yell into a telescope
Aim it at the star of hope
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 3]
All over the under
The smell of blood and thunder
I'm connected by the lightning rod
Giving into the beauty and
Heaven knows how well I know you
[Chorus 2]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 3]
[Outro]
Time

Throw away your television
Time to make this clean decision
Master waits for its collision, now
[Pre-Chorus]
It's a repeat
Of a story told
It's a repeat
And it's getting old
Throw away your television
Make a break, big intermission
Re-create your supervision, now
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
Renegades with fancy gauges
Slay the plague for it's contagious
Pull the plug and take the stages
Throw away your television now
Oy! oy! oy!
Throw away your television
Take the noose off your ambition
Re-invent your intuition, now
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]
[Guitar solo]
Throw away your television
Salivate to repitition
Alleviate this ill condition now
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat
It's a repeat

Close to my skin, I'm falling in
Someone who's been
Sittin' by the phone, 
I'm left alone
In another zone
John says to live above hell
My will is well
No one is waiting for me to fail
My will could sail, yeah
It's such a waste to be wasted in the first place
I want to taste the taste
Of being face to face with common grace
To meditate on the warmest dream
And when I walk alone I listen to our secret theme
[Hook]
Your solar eyes are like nothing I have ever seen
Somebody closer can see right through
I'd take a fall and you know that I'd do anything
I will for you
Sailin' for the sun, cause there is one
Knows where I'm from
I care for you, I really do
I really do
Come closer now so you can lie
Right by my side
Sit alone in the sun, I wrote a letter to you
Getting over myself
[Hook x2]
Close to my skin, someone who's been
I'm a-falling in
Disasters are just another star
Falling in my yard
John says to live above hell
My will is well
Long to be with someone to tell
I love your smell

In the name of it's for you I
Bought it all and it's all untrue I
Know, I'm a little slow
Desparate and it shows
In the name of spending street(?)
Burning bush and a busted knee you
Stole, all the rain and snow
Who will be my Eskimo
It's what I wanna know
It's time to under go
Somewhere in Mexico
I'm making room for you
A Simple Point of view
Someone too deeper to

Searching for an eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you
What did they say
Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you
In the name of Jesus Christ I
Sold my son and I named my price I
Sold, just a little low
Who will be my eskimo
That's what I wanna know
Before I under go
Somewhere in Mexico

A Simple point of view
Someone too deeper to

Searching for an eskimo
Searching and I wanna know, someone, like you

Desperate and I gotta go
Searching for an eskimo, someone, like you
In the name of Oscar Wilde I
Saw the mess and I saw he smiled I
Go, toe to toe in the whole, world to find and eskimo

[Verse 1]
I'm coming for you cause, cause I adore you and
I'd like to get inside your mass production
This indecision has has got me cringing well
I can't resist the smell of your seduction
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go
Unwrap the package without much persuasion
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go
I want to dance to every days occasion
[Chorus]
This I know, yeah this I know (Take me home, well take me home)
This I know we're not alone (Take me home, take me home)
[Verse 2]
When we envision, lack of division and
The planet does another revolution
The day I blew on ya you said I grew on you
Turns out that we are all the one solution
GO!
[Trumpet Solo]
I'm coming at you well, year of the cat too
I like the sound of your articulations
Want to arouse her and maybe 
espouse

She showed me love without the stipulations
[Chorus]
[Guitar Solo]
[Verse 3]
I want to lean on you, get Jan and Dean on you
It's time to sway a little mass perception
I like your cheeky well, so Mozambiquey and
I think the world could use a clear connection
[Chorus][x2]
[Outro]
Did I let you know?
Would you like to go?

[Verse 1]
You got yours and I got mine
She got his and she got shine
Under moon and overseas
She got those and we got these
[Chorus]
Dance, dance, dance, dance
All night long yes all night long
Dance, dance, dance, dance
We got strong yes we got strong
Say hello, its safe to go
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
The light is right, lift here tonight, lets play
Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness for free is here to stay
They got these and we got that
He got his and she got bad
You got mine but I've got yours
I got love but you got more
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Say hello, its safe to go, lets play
Give yourself a chance to find a way
The holiness for free is here to stay
Tell your mom and dad its all okay
The holiness for free is here to stay

He got his and she got shine
We got all but she got high
Some got hot and then gone by
[Chorus][x2]
[Outro]
The light is right
Lift here tonight
Let's make the right
The song of prize lets play

[Verse 1]
You jump in front of my car when
You know all the time that
Ninety miles an hour, girl, is the speed I drive
You tell me it's alright, you don't mind a little pain
You say you just want me to take you for a ride
[Chorus]
You're just like crosstown traffic
So hard to get through to you
Crosstown traffic
I don't need to run over you
Crosstown traffic
All you do is slow me down
And I'm trying to get on the other side of town
[Verse 2]
I'm not the only soul who's accused of hit and run
Tire tracks all across your back
I can see you had your fun
But darling, can't you see my signals turn from green to red
And with you I can see a traffic jam straight up ahead
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I am just a lousy bum
Searching for the unknown crumb
The crumb, the crumb
Something or someone to come
Come along illuminate my lust
Combust
Confucius might have been confused
And Buddha might have blown a fuse
I ooze the muse
[Chorus]
Meet me at the coffee shop
We can dance like Iggy Pop
Another go in the parking lot
Frewak the cheek on your hot spot
[Verse 2]
Back and forth my body's jerking
Will to thrill will not stop working
Work and work
I'll take you on a honeymoon
Jumping on a bed in a hotel room
The room, the groom
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Everything inside of me
Is burning up for you to see
And if we should get into it
A two way kind of syndicate, hold me
Compare us to a Ferris wheel
Just be sure what you want to steal
Some people do it by the book
But I prefer to go by feel, tell me
I wanted to get out of here
But every time I reappear
Now I have the words my dear
To whisper right into your ear, hey, yeah
[Chorus][x4]
C'mon girl, let's get it right
Let's get it right, let's get it right
[Verse 2]
The spirit of a dragon's tear
Is lovely at this time of year
The cave within your mountainside
Is deeper than than it will be wide, hold me
My disenchanted diplomat
Asleep inside the laundromat
Conveyer belts are moving and
I want you to be sure of that, tell me
And if you let it germinate
I know it will be worth the wait
Disputed by the news that it was you
Who tried to instigate, hey
[Chorus][x4]
[Verse 3]
Blessed are the hypocrites
Outwitted but she never quits
The trouble with a band of slits
Is washing off the muddy bits, hey yeah
[Chorus][x4]
[Outro]
Oh yeah
She's with me and I'm your man
If I can't find you no one can

[Verse 1]
Death
Let me catch what's left
Let me see what's left
Let me see what's true
Do I really want to
Run from my depths
Will I have regrets
Will I ever find you
Will I ever find words
That give me motive to express
Bread
Will I go unfed
Will I be the one who rushed on in
To where angel fear to tread
Was it me who bled
On the new death bed
And there is no fear
When you're leaning on love
Those grateful dead
[Chorus]
Someone like you
To research the meaning of love
Someone, I do
To be there when push comes to shove
I know that you know
The ending, the must
[Verse 2]
Chess
Let me play my best
When I do regress
Let it all unwind
Cause' we're never confined to
To the board unless
Less I second guess
Look into the sky
Where we all comply
With something higher than the
Rest my love, sail through
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Sky all around
Fell to the ground
Now I'm a child
Stayed for a while
[Verse 3]
Flesh
Is it meaningless
But we all protest
To the last request
Is there anything you
Could now suggest
Did I do my best
Did I leave it better
Even though we look to be
Just mildly obsessed with you
Sail through
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Someone like you
To be there

[Verse 1]
Down the street you can hear her scream
"You're a disgrace"
As she slams the door in his drunken face
And now he stands outside
And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool
He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad
What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"
Against the door he leans and starts a scene
And his tears fall and burn the garden green
[Chorus]
And so castles made of sand
Fall in the sea eventually
[Verse 2]
A little Indian, brave before he was ten
Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends
And he built a dream that when he grew up
He would be a fearless warrior Indian chief
Many moons passed and the dream grew strong until tomorrow
He would sing his first war song
And fight his first battle but something went wrong
Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
There was a young girl whose heart was a frown
Because she was crippled for life and couldn't speak a sound
And she wished and prayed she would stop living
So she decided to die
She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore
And to her legs she smiled
"You won't hurt me no more"
But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say
"Look a golden winged ship is passing my way"
And it really didn't have to stop
It just kept on going
[Chorus]



[Chorus 1]
Hah, on the ice, no holding my soul
I want men, not mice, no stopping my throw
Hah, get this, reds are back bills
Work or play ball or just turn me loose
[Chorus 2]
I know what's fight, in life, you better buckle down
Don't give up your fight, in life, you better buckle down
Two days with might, in life, you better buckle down
Leave dreams tonight, in life, you better buckle down
Because I know what's right
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Outro][x4]
I know, I know, I know what's right!

[Chorus]
Brave from afar
When I hold you for country
Saved by a star
Can I hold you to one thing
Do you feel safe when
They tell you they sell you
Pray for your children
The shelter they're building
[Verse 1]
Prime time, the perfect crime
Bow my head, the axe we grind
Ruse cruise, P's and Q's
I got beat up by the evening news
Deep hits, the media blitz
Lost my mind to keep my wits
Maintain the same old same
Goodbye shiz and so long game
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Plain Jane, the big campaign
Last detail has been restrained
Fraud, fraud, the lightening rod
See that sign, time to applaud
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Show me a sign that I love you
Blow me your mind cause you always do
Remind me to tell you that I've come to
Believe in the beauty, the power of you
[Chorus]
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company
Ooh ooh ooh, body that's calling me
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm in your company
[Verse 2]
Woman dissolved into the sea
The body of water is calling me
The god of my daughter is always free
There's nothing to solve when you're solving me
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Throw me a line I could use one
A special design because I'm your son
Two thousand below where I feel my love
The body of water where I come from
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
I'm dreaming, got a reason to steal
Fire from the other side out there
Formations flow like streams
I'm made with a life to spare
Get the jizz, Mr. Sism got a rhythm
Technology of a prayer
Scientist to the prism of faith
And hope so I am there
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Baby I'm home, you can come here
The science of love is becoming clear
Invisible love with the color still
A meet to a place in the atmosphere
And I may believe
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
It's always half and half
I'm happy and I'm sad
Everything that's beautiful
Always kills me too
The highest I get up
Is the deepest I get down
You're up there with your life
That's why I got to shout, shout
...And then got to shout, shout
[Chorus]
Blues for Meister
You sweet little thing
Blues for Meister
I'm so sad I gotta sing
A cozy little kitty up
Sitting on the couch
Oh, kitty cat, oh, baby
I really miss you now
Well have some respect
For my cat
He got squashed by the wheel
Of a Cadillac
Well, me and my pussy
We lost our flow
Well, goodbye my little calico
[Verse 2]
Your food's still in the cupboard
Hanging in its can
You used to love to eat it
Down
I'll always love you Meister
You were so good to me
There's nothing like you nowhere
As far as I can see
[Chorus]

[Verse]
Pumpin' the blood through the heart of New Orleans
She's the mystic heat of the Bourbon street dream
She's just made out of flesh and bones
But let me tell you little boy
You better leave her alone
Leroy Brown thought he was bad too
'Till she left him floatin' in the old bayou
She's the kind of girl
She's built like a bomb
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blond, get down!
That blackeyed beauty with the golden crotch
French electric sex a cock shocking swamp fox
Heaten queen of sleeze she's hot to box
But let me tell you little boy
She'll clean your clock
A slick and sly spy
Stuck in the muck of the moat
Blew his mind to find a diamond in the boat
Double-o-dooms day for Mr. James Bond
She's the blackeyed blackeyed
Blackeyed blond, Get down!

[Verse 1]
One day while bathing in the sea
My talking dolphin spoke to me
He spoke to me in symphony
From freedom's peace beneath the sea
He looked to me eyes full of love
Said yes we live behind the sun
[Chorus 1]
Behind the sun[x3]
[Chorus 2]
The sun goes up
And the sun gets down
But like the heart of the sun
My heart continues to pound
Behind the sun
[Verse 2]
Now while I shower in the rain
I watch my dolphin swim away
The one who listens to the surf
Can feel the pulse beat of the earth
And like my dolphin swims so free
The sun does swim into the sea
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
An island flying through the sky
One day your son might ask you why
And if you son should be a girl
She too might ask you of this world
The sun shines sweet upon your beach
And yes my dolphin loves to teach
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
Three miles off the coast of Beirut
New Jersey's guns get ready to shoot
Take a walk down the firing room
Fire one it's shakedown cruise
[Chorus]
Battle ship battle ship
[Verse 2]
See the sailor boys dressed in blue
Cheer the change to make the news
Send the shell down the spiral groove
Bombs away it's a shakedown cruise Yeah
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Someone spilled blood many years ago
Someone spilled blood but do you know
That from the backwoods
Where the Chuck Berrys grow
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll
[Chorus]
Take me to your backwoods now[x2]
[Verse 2]
Spinning down from the clouds
Like a tornado
Spinnin’ out of control
Like a psychedelic soul
With a rhythm hitting harder
Than Larry Holmes
Come your long tall
Daddies of rock and roll
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Mr. Uplift Mofo – my man Bo Diddley
Hit sipping a bottle of nickel ripple
Play the lickity split finger lickin’ licks
For all you wicked city slick chicks
And all you nitty gritty hicks
We’ll make your nipples ripple
Make you wanna dip your dipple
Make you wanna soak your hickory stick
That’s right
Because my man has a grip on it
And I do mean on it
Which brings to mind
A very sinister minister kind of guy
A man named Little Richard
Who was born to make them bitches stir
That’s right he’ll make the sweet substance drip
From the middle of your hillbilly lips
And like the farmer milks his cow
The Howling Wolf will howl
And since times does allow
You all can
Take me to your backwoods now
[Outro]
Take me to your backwoods now[x4]
Take me to your backwoods

[Verse 1]
When will it make a sound
The sound I desire
[Chorus]
Cause we all need something to do
A certain something, that's true
[Verse 2]
Floating upstream I've seen
The spider and the snake
A trip without pause when
I saw my mistake
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
All my life, I have known who I am
A troubled man but I stand
All my life I have seen what it means
To be myself in this dream
[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
On the city streets, I got the tunes in my pocket
I'll play the Chili Pepper so the public can rock
Excuse me mister, won't you hear my thought?
I play in a band, yeah, we're called the Red Hots
While I'm away, boy, I'm afraid not
I've got no time to flick and talk
But this baby rocked out on the spot
She was a shaking and a kicking and that did a bit of tot
Her pop said no, but I just couldn't stop
The killer had a case of tod the rock
[Chorus 2]
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
[Verse]
We stop the fire, we quench the heat
We groove the buttocks walking out in the street
Because that's when in the store when who do we meet?
On a hop skip jump up a baby beat
She was a shaking and a kicking those itty bitty feet
The next thing you know was she got out of her bleat
Five thousand babies walking out in the street
Well, that's a serious sight for me and golly gee wizz!
I just can't tell you how much we did
Rocking right out for those itty bitty girls, right out
[Chorus 2]
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal, so get down!
[Bridge]
Got the tunes in my pocket
Baby appeal
Rock out!
Play the chili, play the chili, play the chili
Yes, we're called the Red...Hots
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
But here's a funky fact that I know is real
The Red Hots have baby appeal
They dig a funky speil, they'll make some speil
I say the Peppers have baby appeal
The funk mobile is the one we wheel
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal
We serve those tots in the funk mobile
I'm overjoyed, we have baby appeal

[Verse 1]
Lucy Reibart
She's a friend of mine
Later she'll go
Back and redefine the line
It's getting longer all the time
Oh yeah
Drinking sunshine
She likes the taste of it
She had a goldmine
But then she wasted it away
You should have seen her yesterday
Oh yeah
[Bridge]
Sing along the way
Nothing stops the ache
[Chorus 1]
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Cosms shiva
Got off
Made you a believer
I don't need to
Tend her, why do I believe you?
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can
[Verse 2]
Missing pieces
She's got a lot of them
Time decreases
I wish I thought of them before
Before it's time to close the store
Oh yeah
Installation
A lonely sink of fame
Some liberation
The only seed we ever farm
I want to help you but I can't
No no
[Bridge]
[Chorus 2]
Sugar daddy
Loves her madly
Love her, leave her
Got off
Made you a believer
Neon soldiers
Left her
Now you've gotten older
Annie wants a baby now
Annie wants a baby any way she can
It's getting longer all the time
It's time to re-design the sign
Oh yeah
Sing along the way

This is the place where all the junkies go
Where time gets fast but everything gets slow
Can I get some Vaseline?
Step into a modern scene
Take a chance on that which seems to be the making of a dream
I don't wanna do it like my daddy did
I don't wanna give it to my baby's kid
[Hook]
This is my calling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
Hammers are falling, I said my darling
Shocking, appalling all I can do to you
This is the place where all the devils plead
Their case to take from you what they need
Can I isolate your gene?
Can I kiss your dopamine?
In a way I wonder if she's living in a magazine
I don't wanna say it if it isn't so
I don't wanna weigh it but I've got to know
[Hook]
I saw you out there yesterday
What did you wanna say?
A perfect piece of DNA
Caught in a flashing ray
I caught you out there in the fray
What did you wanna say?
A master piece of DNA
Caught
 in a flashing ray
Can I smell your gasoline?
Can I pet your wolverine?
On the day my best friend died
I could not get my copper clean
I don't wanna take it up with little Joe
I don't wanna fake it but I've gotta know
[Hook]
I am a misfit
I'm born with all of it
The fucking ultimate
Of love inside the atom split
I'm in a flash ray
A mash of DNA
Another popping Jay
Who thinks he's got something to say

[Verse 1]
Driving up the coast
To find a version of the truth
Left the backdoor swinging
Like a dirty little sleuth
The truth is I have never
Felt half this alive
Now it’s time to dance
Upon the grave called 45
Jacked up on some Kerouac
And surely bullet proof
The girl who taught me what to do
Was missing her front tooth
Gentle as a storm
Inside your mental health
I want to find the answer
But I just can’t find myself
[Chorus 1]
I say so long
To the way I played
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
Hey let’s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown
[Verse 2]
Later I would look for love
Inside a woman’s dorm
A couch to keep me humble
And her breath to keep me warm
Ophelia was the girl
That I was feeling for
Come to realize
It was me who was the whore
A captain lost himself
Inside a 40 year old skull
The drink of choice was knowledge
And we always wanted more
Drunken sailors
Seeking their Geronimo
Instead they found the things
That they really didn’t want to know
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Country roads
Would never let me stay
The way I played
Inside of yesterday
[Verse 3]
A devil’s growl and cat’s meow
Were blended into one
Termites called suburbanites
Were eating all the fun
A juggernaut of comedy
And blasphemy
I want to stop the madness
But I think it has to be
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Outro]
Hey let’s run around
The great escape
From out of my hometown

[Verse]
Take me back
Hold my hand
All the way back
To the brotherland
Take me back
I want to go back
Take me back
And my funky ass band
All the way back
To the brotherland
Take me back
[Chorus]
I want to go
As fast as I can
Slidin' on back
To the brotherland
Now children
Hollywood
[Verse 2]
I want to get up and go
With my funky ass jams
All the way back
To the brotherland
Take me back
I want to go back
Hollywood
Where the women
Is the women
And the man
Is the man
[Chorus]
I want to go
As fast as I can
Slidin' on back
To the brotherland
Now children

[Verse 1]
PT-boat on the way to Havana
I used to make a living, man
Pickin' the banana
Now I'm a guide for the CIA
Hooray for the USA!
[Chorus]
Baby, baby, make me a loco
Baby, baby, make me a mambo
[Verse 2]
Sent to spy on a Cuban talent show
First stop - Havana au go-go
I used to make a living, man
Pickin' the banana
Hooray for Havana!
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Stop marching cause you think you shot to number one
Counting days and skipping your stones into the sun
Overrated on the form it goes to where you turn
I'll be yours tonight
Living the dream of a meteorite!
[Chorus]
Stop jumping cause we got something to say, yeah
Young lovers keep it pumping in the streets of L.A., yeah
[Verse 2]
Short stroking butterfly
Better to go for broke
What you're smoking? Mary Jane?
It doesn't make you choke
Jumping the fence, riding the waves
Can you take a joke?
I'll be yours today
Living the dream with a capital K!
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Tell me now, tell you how
Just show me where to sit
Make time for love and your happiness
The mothers of invention are the best
We all learn and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess
I guess
Half blinded
I'm reminded how to find myself
Nickel and dime I think
It's time to play some musical chairs
Dirty laundry, what a wandering
Ask her if she cares
I'll be yours and more
Better than ever like never before!
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Make time for love and your happiness
The mothers of invention are the best
We all know and struggle with some loneliness
A tender mess for everyone I guess
I guess
Sweet talking, there is a marker
To your part of town
Never again
We're trying to see your love supremed and bound
Is it ever meant to be
And is it so profound?
[Outro]
Is it you and me play it to one make history
A history
Said yeah
Oh yeah

[Verse]
Feeling good and I don’t know why
Another day and another high
I walk around like I am on the ray
Somewhere way in the rays of Hanalei
I met a girl and I liked her vibe
Another day and another ride
I met a girl who wants to save the world, save the world
Make it safe for someone else to find their faith
I’m away I’m away... Hanalei
A simple song and it made me cry
I really don’t want to pass me by
A simple song that spoke of Hemmingway
The revolution in your blood creates the wave
I picked her up on the road to surf
Looked a lot like a mother earth
She said hello my name is Charlotte Gray, hey
Make it safe for someone else to find their faith
I’m away I’m away... Hanalei

[Verse]
About this planet, there is something I know
There's a very big difference between above and below
A friend foe, or bro, leave your body on the floor
Let your spirit fly away like the soul of a crow
Here, above land, man has laid his plan
And yes, it does include the Ku Klux Klan
We got a government so twisted and bent
Bombs, tanks and guns is how our money is spent
We got V.D., heroin, greed and prostitution
Tension, aggravation, L. Ron Hubbard solution
Not to mention hard-core chemical pollution
If you think you're just away, you're in a mental institution
And that's a heart felt shame
Because everyone's crazy, everyone's the same
So, why should only Larry, Curly and Moe be to blame?
Time now to take you to a different place
Where peace loving whales flow through liquid outer space
A grooving and a glidding as graceful as lace
A never losing touch with the ocean's embrace
Diviner than the dolphin, that there is none
Because dolphins just-a like to have a lot of fun
No one tells 'em how their life is run
And no one points at them with a gun
They have a lot of love for every living creature
The smile of a dolphin is a built in feature
They be moving in schools but everyone's the teacher
Someday mister dolphin, I know I'm going to to meet you
Back to the land of the police man
Where he does whatever he says he can
Including hating you because you're a Jew
Or beating black ass, that's nothing new
Trigger happy cops, they just like to brawl
They use guns, clubs, gas, but that's not all
They got puke, ridden prisons and sex sick jails
Fuck the poor, if you're rich you pay the bail
So support your police, support your local wars
That's the way to open economic doors
Why do we do it? Because the president's a whore
We assume the position to sell the ammunition
What the fuck? It's the american tradition
Along with going fishing apple pies in the kitchen
Isn't it bitching seeing dead men in ditches?

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
Junior paints that old cafe
He's got to change those girls around
Westbound drunk with lots to say
But he never makes a sound
Hustlers get what they deserve
But its always half the date
Good things come to those who wait
Like an expiration date
[Chorus]
See you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
I lead all your mind games astray
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll play all night, hey don't get uptight
See you, so long, goodbye, hooray
[Verse 2]
Curb your tongue oh scallywag
Because you got no flag to wave
Save your breath for the black and white
Every dog will have its day
[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 3]
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around, I'll see you around
I'll see you around
Goodbye and Hooray
[Outro]
Well I'll see you around, I'll see you around oh nah nah nah no!

[Verse]
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through
Some people sad I pray for
No one you want to live, the eyes that once were his
Some people sad I pray for
The way you want to live, the eyes you want to give
Some people say you played me
I don't care if it's true, I'm waiting here for you
Some people say you made it
I'm not afraid to know, when things are getting low
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's true, things that you're going through
Some people say you hate me
I don't believe it's you, things that you're going through

[Intro]
Get up and jump, get up and jump, get up, get up, get up and jump
Jump on up
Jump on down
Just jump a jump a jump a jump a jump around
Jump the day away
Jump all over town
Because jumping is O.K. in a jumping kinda way, hey hey
[Verse 1]
Jump a boy
Jump a girl
Jump a rope
Jump for joy
Just don't stop jumping
Keep your heart muscle pumping
Hillel be jumping on that little baby frumpking
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants
When you're just standing or sitting still
Think about the frogs getting a thrill
Take a little lesson from the kangaroos
Don't you know they're jumping foos, jump you
Jump a nun
Jump a Jack
Jump for fun
Jump back
How's about us jumping in the sack?
And now, it's time for a jump attack
[Chorus 1]
Get up and jump (X8)
[Chorus 2]
Jam Bob, Jim Bob, Slim Bob Boogie
To the tune of slima Billy
Looking like you're mighty silly
Say what, You got a pumpkin in your pants[x2]
[Verse 2]
Mister Mexican jumping bean knows
His fun is skeaky clean
Christ, how'd you think that he got so clean
Not from sitting on his goddamn spleen. Get up
Oh, I be jumping I be jumping I be jumping alone
I be jumping for the phone
I be jumping Misses Jones
I really want to jump on Kinski's bones
[Chorus 1][x16]
Get up and jump
[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
Why do you do what you do
I do what I want to do
Who said you could do what you do
I told you who told me to
I do what I want to do[x2]
[Chorus 2]
Funky crime funky crime
Don't you know funk's colors blind
Well I've committed a funky crime
Against a state of mind
[Verse 1]
Hey you mister interview
I don't have to answer you
This is what I grew into
Don't judge me and my soul stew
Cause funk is my attitude
Funk is my attitude
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 2]
Barriers of race
In the media take place
Tellin'you there is no room
For what you do, don't budge
There's no groove to your gloom
Who made you the judge
Always room for funky tunes
And yes I funk it up
[Bridge]
Funky boy
Meets a funky girl
Make it funky, baby
Cause the funk is crazy
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Outro]
Funky crime[x2]
Funky funky crime
The crime is funky

Fuck 'em just to see that look on their face
Say it out loud
I'm freaky styley and I'm proud!

[Intro]
Well alright
Now dig this!
[Verse 1]
You don't care for me, I don't care about that
You got a new fool, huh? I like it like that
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love with your fire?
[Chorus][x4]
Let me stand next to your fire
Funky, funky fire
[Verse 2]
Now listen to this baby
And stop acting so crazy
You say your mom isn't home, it's not my concern
Just don't play with me, and you won't get burned
I have only one burning desire
Oh, I'm going to do it in your fire
[Chorus][x4]
[Verse 3]
Oh, move over, over
And let Mr. Huckleberry take over
You know he's bad, you know he drowns, you know who he gives it to, yeah
That's right
Now dig this!
You try to give me your money
You better save it, babe
Save it for your rainy day
I have only one burning desire
Oh, can I make love over your fire?
[Chorus][x4]
[Outro]
You better slide you ass over, girl
Because I'm coming through once and I'm coming the way you must be

[Pre-Chorus][x4]
Do a fat dance[x2]
Do a, do a, do a fat dance
[Chorus 1]
One reason why I got you for
A woman is that you can do the moveable
Kitchen or bedroom or bathroom floor
Keep it moving because I need the hardcore
[Pre-Chorus][x2]
[Chorus 2]
Soft, she's off and left
Now I'm coming
I'm feeling in the ghetto because that's my trouble
[Pre-Chorus][x4]
[Verse 1]
Another reason why I love your ass
Your dancing like everyday could be your last
Do you, do you, do you want to dance
Lets get it on like black trash
[Pre-Chorus][x2]
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 2]
I met her on the school yard and
She was such a cool card
She took me for a fool
Because I acted like a bodyguard
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She was just the cutest thing
My God, that I have ever seen
Tearing up my seraton and messing
With my dopamine
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
Just about the time
That I was feeling fine again
She walked into the room
Wearing nothing but a cardigan
Oh Yohanna love, my Yohanna love
She knew what she was doing
When she told me no she would
Never let the perfect message
In and get the perfect screwing
Oh Yohanna love, oh, oh
[Pre-Chorus][x2]
[Bridge]
Number three reasons why I'm in your house
Hot butter melts across your mouth
Dancing and a dancing, And a dancing machine
Somebody move, Somebody scream
Yeah
[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
What ever never knew
That I could feel so good
Smile in your eyes
What ever never knew
That I could walk through wood
I guess I never tried
A million years old
But just a little girl
Vibing off the gong
Rubbing on the bowls
Make you float around
Make your loving strong
[Pre-Chorus]
And when we get
In the same place
At the same time
It is your grace
That I want to
Fall right into now
To love avow
[Chorus]
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
I'm falling into grace with you
I'm falling into guru muhk
[Verse 2]
She moves in a rapture
That her capsule might
Land on your star
Meditating in the morning
Head dressed in white
Beauty bazaar
You can smell the purple light
Coming from her heart
Get lost and wet
I treat you like a teacher
Because that's what you are
I want to be your pet
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus][x3]

[Verse 1]
Love is all the world
You say the world is gone
Love is all the world
You say it's gone
I don't
The party in your eyes
Says someone to caress
A party in the sky
I think I'll wear a dress
[Chorus 1]
God save us all and tell us how it ends
Laugh till we fall so why can't we be friends
[Verse 2]
Mother taught me what to do in cocktail times
Work and play all day until the sun resigns
Haley and the comets sang an old rock jam
The ukulele play another song I'll brag
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Stole a lot from Peter
Cause you to pay your Paul
And when you find that's not enough
He'll break your fall
[Verse 3]
Some get on and some
Get off the carousel
I think it's time to go
So I will fare thee well
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
How strong is my love? [x3]
How wrong could it be?
[Verse 1]
I'll walk a water mile
Rest a while to kiss your smile
Laugh and roll and after a while
I'll begin to like your style
[Chorus 2]
How strong is my love?
How wrong could it be?
She turned me down this time
She turned me down
Lord, I can't believe she
She turned me down
She turned me inside out
She turned me down
All I ask of you
Is turn me up this time
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 2]
Come on over show me your
Your glow soul I do adore
I'll be sure to drop my guard
Give it up it's not that hard
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
Tested life but that's alright
Darker than the darkest night
Living hell and pollocks at you
Getting new down your back
[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
I told you before, stay away from my door
Don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother
The freaks on the phone, won't leave me alone
So don't give me that brother, brother, brother, brother
No!
[Chorus]
I, I found out!
I, I found out!
[Verse 2]
Now that I showed you what I been through
Don't take nobody's word what you can do
There ain't no Jesus gonna come from the sky
Now that I found out I know I can cry
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand
Don't get you nowhere don't make you a man
I heard something 'bout my Ma and my Pa
They didn't want me so they made me a star
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Old Hare Krishna got nothing on you
Just keep you crazy with nothing to do
Keep you occupied with pie in the sky
There ain't no guru who can see through your eyes
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
I've seen through junkies, I've been through it all
I seen religion from Jesus to Paul
Don't let them fool you with dope and cocaine
No one can harm you, feel your own pain
[Outro]
I, I found out!
I, I found this out!
I, I found out!

[Verse 1]
If you want me to stay
I'll be around today
To be available for you to see
I'm about to go there
Then you'll know
For me to stay here
I've got to be me
You'll never be in doubt
That's what it's all about
You can't take me for granted and smile
Count the days I'm gone
Forget reachin' me by phone
Cause I promise
I'll be gone for a while
[Chorus]
And when you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
[Verse 2]
You got to get it straight
How could I ever be late
When you're my woman
Taking up my time
Oh how could I ever allow
I guess I wonder how
I could get out a pocket for fun
When you know that
You're never number two
Number one's gonna be number one
I'll be good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now
[Chorus]
When you see me again
I hope that you have been
The kind of person
That you really are now
I'll be so good
I wish I could
Get this message over to you now
Get this message over to you now
I'll be so good
I wish I could

[Pre-Chorus]
Some come up and some come young
Live to love and give good tongue
Sit down get down in the sun
Rocket to the woman is on the one
[Chorus 1]
I like dirt [x4]
[Verse 1]
The earth is made of dirt and wood
And I'd be water if I could
Live in a dream
In your stream
Live in a dream
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Some come slow and overload
Must roll over when you're told
Let's unzip and let's unfold
A letter to the pet better get it to go
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 2]
Space is made of everything
And I'd be fire that I bring
Live in a dream
In your spring
Live in a dream
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus 1]
[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my, me and my friends[x4]
[Verse 1]
Like two sweet peas
In an even sweeter pod
That’s my friend
And my friend’s named Bob
Like the devil knows hell
I know Bobby well
Well enough to tell you
‘Bout his 67 smells
Well enough to tell you
He’s a hell-a-swell-a fellow
Well enough to tell you
That we know each other better
Than we know ourselves
Like freaks of a feather
We rock together
I know Bob well
But I think he knows me better
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
He’s as close to me
As a friend can be
I’ll be standin’ by my buddy
He’ll be standin’ by me
Just another half of
The two headed freak
Bit I need him like
My heart needs to beat
At this point
In this friendly verse
I’ve gotta sing a little something
That I haven’t rehearsed
It’s about my man
And his name is Hillel
For whom my love
Is soul-brother sacred
Take it Huckleberry
Slim Boy take it
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Jacky’s eyes are closed
But he’s right on course
Because he’s guided by
The invisible force
He drives a kooky green Chrysler
Bad as anybody’s Porsche
He’s a working class drummer
He’s as strong as a horse
[Chorus]

[Intro]
Your in the middle of June in the summer of '59, I was young and cool, shot a bad game of pool, and I hustled all the chumps I could find. Now they call me the swan cause I wave my magic wand and I loved all the women to death. I partied hard, packed a mean rod, and I'll knock you out with a right or left
[Verse 1]
Nevermind the Pac Jam
Nevermind the Gap Band
Nevermind the Zap Band
Nevermind the Funk Scam
[Chorus]
Cause we're
Red Hot Chili Peppers
[Verse 2]
Nevermind the British bands
Nevermind the Synth Funk bands
Nevermind the Wham Wham band
Nevermind Duran Duran
[Chorus]
Cause we're
Red Hot Chili Peppers
[Verse 3]
Nevermind the Soft Cell shit
That's strictly for the twits
Nevermind the Men At Work
Those tunes are for the jerks
[Chorus]
Cause we're
Red Hot Chili Peppers
[Verse 4]
Nevermind Hall and Oates
Those guys are a couple of goats
Nevermind the Culture Club
That jive's just one big flub
[Chrous]
Cause we're
Red Hot Chili Peppers

[Verse 1]
If I stole it all, or hesitate
The world would always never seems to wait
A comedy that could be so divine
Never is a long time
A shadow born to steal the light of day
You woke me up and said come on let’s play
But now I know this never had between
[Chorus]
You are, you are the star within
The far, the far, the far away
The law that caused it all to stay
By you, by you, by you, by you, for you, I do
[Verse 2]
I thought I done it all, I thought I knew
But nothing ever looked as clear as you
Now every never that I knew was fine
But Never is a long time
Now I share this feeling in my yang
Stolen good time, always give away
A never that will always wonder what the star will say
From far, from far, from far away
The law that caused it all to stay by you, by you
By you, by you
A baby clapping on your dress, will always have a place I guess, by you, by you
I’m in love, and we could bless the pleasure of my child’s best
Lonely books and tenderness, to rescue me from emptiness
[Chorus]

[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 1]
Right here, girl
Sweet thing, you look so sad
Cheer up, don't you know your dad is bad
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad
There are not no problem I can't face, because
Your daddy's got a bigger bag of tricks
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad
[Chorus][x2]
[Verse 2]
Come on, sit on your daddy's lap because
I'm the one who pats your back
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad
Lemme see now where to begin
Lemme start by tucking you in
Give daddy a kiss, girl
Oh, dad
[Chorus]

[Chorus 1]
We're millionaires
Against hunger
[Chorus 2]
I'm a millionaire
And I got something to say
I got a million more that'll take me away
All the other ones' bills starting to percolate
As far as I'm concerned, why that's okay
[Verse 1]
Well I'm a millionaire too, but not like you
As far as I'm concerned, I got a job to do
I've got to pave the way, I've got to save the day
I've got to make it better, I've got to say
You and I, we're millionaires, but we're a million miles away from the saint who stares
Upon the millions who die, every day of the week
Just because they can't get enough to eat
While we the rich dine on all these feasts, and everything's fine, yeah peaches and creme
But it just isn't something you've got to realize, there's something wrong, we've got to open our eyes
When the world cries, we just can't hide, we've got a job to do, we've got to save some lives
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 3]
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Twice as nice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
A spiritual price do you care
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Dice the mice when you share
Hey hey Mr. Millionaire
Pave the way, take the dare
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 2]
Well I'm a millionaire too
All I know that is true is that I've got more cash than I can use
I want anything that I can have, but I don't need nothin' and I never have
Each damn day my heart's set far, but I'll be okay, cuz I don't starve
Kids from the street the losing their emotion so damn snobby so out of touch
With two hungry people who die as they stare at the city at night, you know it gives to share
So listen up, you millionaires, every woman, every man, help all you can
All races unite, and I will now concern to the type of problem that helps us learn
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 3]

[Verse 1]
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy me
I look around I need another remedy
The I don't know is philosophy
Better yet, I'll let you get ahead of me
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy me
Come around I need another enemy
Anyone could clearly see
A summer breeze is part of my anatomy
When it's written in Britain
We get a little smitten
Like a kitten, a cuddle is where I'm benefiting'
Any higher the fire would have to petrify her
Upon the wire the flyer is gonna satisfy her
[Chorus]
My love is forever, my love it can feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this
[Verse 2]
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Coming down I gotta case of gravity
Even though we disagree
Give a kiss cause life could be the death of me
Acrobatic the static is getting too dramatic
Comin' down with the system
We'll get it systematic
Fascilitatin' the mating, my love is circulating
Rejuvenating the fading but never dialating
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Mercy, mercy, mercy me
Lovin' on the color of an Emily
Easy as a guarantee
Better yet, I'll show you what you wanna see
[Outro]
My love is forever, I want you to feel this
My breathless defender
Step forward and steal this
We aim to forever, I want you to feel this
My gentle defender
Step forward and steal this

[Verse 1]
Persistant mist that faults my vision
Phsyco-exist point of collision
[Chorus]
It's raining in my cranium
My head feels like a stadium
[Verse 2]
3 pound of grey
About to burst
Inside my 3 pound
Universe
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
These are the melancholy mechanics of my mind[x2]
[Verse 3]
Symbols I've been given to express my goal
Always come up short
You know they just don't get that low
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Verse 4]
Quick release chemicals strike with incomprehensible precision
Biorganic electronics targeting microscopic destinations of devistation
[Outro]
Cleaner than light
Meaner than a laser fight in the night 2000
Billions of micro maniacs unknown to most as the uncontrollable soldiers of suffering succotash
Instantaneous infiltration leaves me with a case of bustation, frustration
Alone in the constellation of alienation detached from empty conversation
I wait[x2]
For the wave to break

[Verse 1]
Please don't ask me who, who you think I am
I could live without that, I'm just a modest man
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do
Cause I'm messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest, I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
[Verse 2]
Please don't ask me where, where you think I've been
I've been a lot of places, but this could be my win
Meet me at the corner where I'll, tell me what to do
Cause I'm messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest, I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
[Bridge]
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
I feel so bad, I thought you'd want to know
Something I wanna show, I thought you ought to know
[Verse 3]
Please don't say you want to keep in touch out there
To see you on the corner, that I just can't bare
Meet me at the corner and oh, tell me what to do
Cause I'm messed up on you, and had I known all that I do now
I'm guessing we're through now
Receding into the forest, I will lay around and wait
And I'll wait for you
[Verse 4]
Hey I turn, I turn my head when I thought I saw a sign from the 
gods
A sign from the gods that you weren't meant to be mine, and it's fine
Taking it all for a ride 'til the day when it's gone
Mystified by where, it all went wrong when it's gone
I live and I learn and I lose and I win, but it's better whenever
Whenever I'm in, thank you girl for everywhere that I've been

[Verse]
Loving and touching and
Laughing and Squeezing and
Walking and Joking and
Smiling and Teasing
Loving and kissing and
Rubbing and scrubbing and
Styling and slumming and
Rolling and Cumming
I'll hold you a lifetime
I'll love you forever
I'll make you my wife and
I'll never forget you
I'll give you my smile
On the face of your child
I will give you my love[x2]
[Outro]
Loving and touching and[x4]
Love

[Verse 1]
My love comes, and when it does
It's a crazy kind of
Selective affection
My love flows lika a wize guy's tie
In the zanniest of directions
My love protection, my love erection
You better get some of my infection
My love can be-a-bigger than
The hoover dam
My love can hide behind
A grain of sand
My love for life is fueled by
The love for my man
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I love his mother and
The silly mystic man
Some people think he's bad
They say he doesn't laugh
And ask my dad
[Chorus]
My love is death to apartheid rule
My love is deepest depth, the ocean blues
[Verse 3]
My love is the zulu groove
My love is keep it or move
My love is a laughing boozed
My love is the pussy juice
My love can't be refused
My love is getting my food
My love, my love
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
My love began from love
My love for an unknown grubby bum
My love for the baby sucking on his thumb
My love for the best set of buns
My love for the feel of the drums
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
My love for a butter knuckle hands
My love for the sweedes in the bad
My love for the legs that I spin
My love for the fat mingy
My love, my love
My love is my gross inner-self
My love is my dick in my head
My love is my gross inner-self
My love is my dick in my head
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sat on a cliff wondering what did I miss
I watched the waves come in
Roll in, roll out, without a single doubt
Lone on the bluff, is there ever enough
I stare into the air, somewhere out there
The family affair, bring home the night
[Chorus]
There I know that you turn off the light
The-e-e-re so slow but you gave me the love of my life
She gave me the love, she gave the love
[Verse 2]
Coming up short and I’m sad to report, with us invite tonight
Your kiss, my kiss, another day to waste
Lovers don’t miss, when they can’t even face a plot that has a twist
To share, my prayer, I need my baby bed
Come home tonight
Whoa
[Chorus][x3]

[Verse 1]
Let's make evil
Let's make good
I'd do anything I could
Just to get you in my dirt word
Go down on you
Seventeen and thirty-one
I am just my mother's son
Brown eyes and a silver tongue
All the mothers come undone
At the sight of me
[Chorus]
The water's falling clear
Interiors decieve i fear
I think I'll kiss my shame away
My prudence is not dear
Inside out and feeling weird
I think I'll kiss my shame away
[Verse 2]
Let's get soft
Let's get hard
Let's get off in my backyard
Where the desert wind
Will wash our skin
A lighter red
Let's make peace
Let's make war
Let's break into heaven for
A dance with heaven's devils or
Is that more than you can store
Inside your head
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame[x2]
[Verse 3]
Let's get gentle
Let's get pissed
Get your knickers in a twist
Cause the angel and the devil kiss
They fell in love
Some seem dirty
Some say clean
Something from a madman's dream
Am I really what I seem?
Rising to my head like cream
It feels so strange
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Slay my shame[x2]
I don't want to live alone
Get on my throne
Slay my shame[x2]

[Verse 1]
On the corner into my car
I drive forever never get far
The 45 is slowly getting loaded
I send another song to my star
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get it off
Take more than your
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
[Verse 2]
A pendulum inside of my bed
Swinging low, I hope to get hit
The overflow is slow, but not enough no
Another drop will never fix it
California mountains in the morning
Get along, and get it all
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement, get if off
Take more than your friends
[Chorus]
If I call you lately
I could be your man
I could be your greatness
If I call you lately
I could be your man
Whoa whoa, whoa whoa
[Verse 3]
I shut it down the look in my eyes
Knock 'em dead a' covered in flies
The big sleep without a bed of roses
The light of day will never tell lies
All along the woman's got a want it
Stitch it up, and get it all
California mountains in the morning
Stitch it up, and get it all
We all walk your pavement
Take more than your friends
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
On the river into my dock
I paddle through the shadow and fog
To ponder all of those who came before me
Another piece for building my arch
[Chorus]

[Verse]
I cry, I cry
I was born in a land, I don't think you understand
God, damn what I am
I'm a native of this place, please don't kick me in my face
My race has been disgraced
Won't somebody testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify, kick a hole right in the sky
Slap a liar in his eye, kick a hole right in the sky
Testify, testify kick a hole right in the sky
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny
Puts us in a pumpkin shell, where you keep us very well
It's hell, where I dwell
When history books are full of shit, I become the anarchist
I'm pissed at this
What this country claims to be
It's a lie
No place for me
I bleed
Kill my trust if you must
But in my blood there is lust for life
That's right
Apache blood is in my heart, thrashing though me like a shark
Crashing though the dark
What am I supposed to do?
I feel like I'm cut into
Confused by rules
Do these cultures clash or am I living in the past?
I ask please tell me fast
To what do I belong and if I change will I be wrong
I took my foot, kicked a hole in the sky
I proceeded to plead, father help me decide
A jagged flash of light struck me in the eye
I turned around and found that I was still alive
Snakes rise high from the purple black sky
The red cloud rains and the black horse rides
Then it dawned on my like the morning sun
I'm a part of two worlds and the morning comes
Glowing embers tend to remember when
The power that is peace was treated as a friend
I am a master of and I've got to take action
I'm a man, the animal man

[Intro]
I tumble into space, try to stop the fall
My body ripped and tore, I could have floated in space
Could have floated
[Verse]
I stumble around my home
I am on the outside My legs and arms are lead, feeling love from no one
Could have floated My head weighs ninety-pounds and I've been down
My friends are aliens and I've been down
Well now I've got no wife Cut a lizard's tail, it grows back to life
I killed some sleepless nights, my heart's torn to pieces
Could have floated I am the funny guy, yeah I've been down
I am the big rock star yeah I've been down
I'll never be the same, cause I've been inside out
And I want to be an animal and take care of my own
My head weighs ninety pounds and I've been down
My friends are aliens and I've been down
I know what it's like cause I've been down Devil sneaks in and deals and I've been down

[Verse]
In love dying
There’s a flawless rain
In love dying
One foot in the astral plane
Someone’s sighing
There’s a virgin road
Waiting to be strode
Rope’s untying
This power I could not withhold
Satisfying
What do we contain
Can’t stop crying
These tears of change
Remain the same
My girl she shoots down
The baddest of guys
She knows that they
Want me dead
She fires up the starry night
And fills them so full
So full of lead
In love dying
Does it go two ways
In love dying
This body I can not detain
Wake up flying
She the solar shores
Passers buying
The memories we readorn
In love dying
Nothing to obtain
In love dying
No crawling thru
The halls of fame
In love dying
Loss becomes the gain
In love dying
Recreate me
So I may sustain

[Verse 1]
Walking around
Out of a town
Walking it out
When you want to
Soldiering my style is smiling
Turn it into whatever I've chosen
Take me now to the water
[Chorus]
Don't be late, I hear it
Going to be so very great and
Out the door I'm walking like a runaway
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway
[Verse 2]
Kick it around
Stare at the ground
Breaking it down
When you want to
Soldiering my days I've chosen
Dancing round, do whatever I want to
Take me now it's the water
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
I think I know, everything you're going to say
I think you know, don't want to runaway
[Chorus]
[Outro]
All the reasons that I count of you can hold away
More and more, I'm a walking like a runaway [x3]

[Verse 1]
I should be on my way
I really ought not stay
Far too strong with the pinnup on
Hear my conscience - I'm gone!
I should have let you know
This boy was made to roam
The band is who I'm married to
And this is what God said to do
I let my motor stray
Forgive me where I play
Sending my love to a Tennessee
She got style now let's see
I remember who
To surrender to
The captain of my ship is brave
It's brothers hood on a Mother's Day
[Interlude]
Do do do dit do [4x]
[Chorus]
I show enough I love you
I show enough I do
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to
[Verse 2]
I'm off to wonderland
Just in my second hand
Life is short but ain't it grand
I'm a way outside but in demand
I'll take it on my chin
Go back and forth again
Find me on some telephone
With a broken down voice and a shake-ed tone
Do unto others who
You would have do to you
Ain't no way I'd ever trade
That sparer life for this piece of shade
Destined for battle zone
Why's there no lesson known
The lesson's not to wait for me
Unless you got a taste for the bittersweet
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Let your joy decide[x2]
Everything we do [2x]
Let your motor ride[x2]
Everything we do
Ow, hit me!
[Interlude]
[Chorus]
[Outro]
We could have made it, my love
We could have skated through
So just remember who you
Who you surrender to

[Pre-Chorus]
The freakiest show I know
Is the show of my own
Living my life in and out
Of the twilight zone
[Chorus]
Bust my britches
Bless my soul
I'm a freak of nature
Walking totem pole
Look and see, I think you'll agree
Nobody weird like me
[Verse 1]
Intercourse with a porpoise
Is a dream for me
Hell-bent on inventing
A new species
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Riding down the path
On the back of a giraffe
Me and the giraffe laughed
Because I passed some gas
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Enchanted as a rabbit
That my life is a dream
Well, everything is never
Just as it seems
[Pre-Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm a radio Joe of the biz called show
I'm a rocking pop-star with a get up and go
Rubbing elbows with the big wigs at my sold out shows
I've been on every cover, even Rolling Stone
[Chorus]
Put us on MTV
All we really need
Begging on our knees
Please, please, please, please, please
[Verse 2]
Conforming to the norm straight out of the mold
Compromising each and every ounce of soul
I'm doing anything for the records of gold
I only want what I can hold
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
We know that we'll never be better than
Mister slick superstar David Letterman
I promise we'll be perfect gentlemen
Just put us on the show you'll regret us then
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Thank you very much, be sure to label us
We wouldn't want to cause a ruckus or a fuss
AOR, CHR, Top Forty or Bust
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
What I am is a picture on the TV screen
Don't make waves, don't make a scene
What I say when I play isn't worth a bean
I'm a video Joe in an industry
[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
Porcelain
Are you wasting away in your skin
Are you missing the love of your kin
Drifting and floating and fading away
[Verse 1]
Porcelain
Do you smell like a girl when you smile?
Can you bear not to share with your child?
Drifting and floating and fading away
[Chorus 2]
Little lune
All day
Little lune
[Verse 2]
Porcelain
Do you carry the moon in your womb?
Someone said that you're fading too soon
Drifting and floating and fading away
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
I saw you at the police station and it breaks my heart to say
Your eyes had wandered off to something distant, cold and grey
I guess you didn't see it coming
Someone's gotten used to slumming
Dreaming of the golden years
I see you had to change careers
Far away, but we both know its somewhere
I saw you on the back page of some free press yesterday
The drift wood in your eyes said nothing short of love for pay
I know you from another picture
Of someone with the most convictions
We used to read the funny papers
Fooled around and pulled some capers
Not today, send a message to her
A message that I'm coming, coming to pursue her
[Chorus 1]
Down home country I rest my face on your bed
I've got you ten times over, I'll chase you down 'til you're dead
[Verse 2]
I saw you on a TV station and it made me want to pray
An empty shell of loveliness is now dusted with decay
What happened to the funny paper?
Smiling was your money maker
Someone ought to situate her
Find a way to educate her
All the way, time to come and find you
You can't hide from me girl, so never mind what I do
[Chorus 2]
Tell your country I, rest my face on your bed
I bet my sovereign country and I, left it all for your head
[Verse 3]
I saw you in the church and there was no time to exchange
You were getting married and it felt so very strange
I guess I didn't see it coming
Now I guess it's me who's bumming
Dreaming of the golden years
You and I were mixing tears
Not today, not for me but someone
I never could get used to, so now I will refuse to
[Chorus 2]
I got my best foot forward and I'll chase you down 'til you're dead

(Intro)
(Verse 1)
Todays just, not my day
Feeling lonely, & ashamed
All my skies, are filled with grey
Now
Tell me what, you want
I need to hear, you say It
I think, Its time, for change
Well
Gotta keep, my head high
No matter, the strain
Stay strong, no matter, the pain
But these pictures, on the wall
Keep reminding me, of myself
I guess I'm, burning em all
Whoa...
My life consists of drinking, & partying
High energy shows, for a mid level, audience
People talking smack, Like I knew him, when he started
And his music ain't shit, seen the closets, I recorded In
Nah
You ain't never ever know me
& most people don't, made It on my own solely
Except for the real friends, I kept close by
Now they all apart of the crew
We reaping the H.I
But these visions of a wall, still here
Like an image in my mind, not erased, just smeared
I can see all of my faults, I can see all of my fears
I can feel all of the hatred, for haters
Over years, I've been doing this
Years I've been, writing raps
Years had to, cypher tracks
So cheers, If you real, If you not, please don't holla back
Cause I don't need fake niggas, in my circle
All I need is my lord Jesus, & that purple
So when I'm under a bridge, and I feel like I can't move
Take a look at my life, and all the things, I want to do
Yeah I know, I'm going places, yeah I'm, going places
Taking flight
Another new place, another new stage, couple thousand faces
Feeling right
Asking where, I go, when I disappear, & the lights turn off
Asking where, I go, when I reappear, some place they thought was a joke
Let somebody know
(Chorus)
I don't ever want to feel, like I did that day
Chilling in the place I love, the 50th state
Tired of being insecure, from all the pictures, of myself
It's time to move on
(Verse 2)
So I'm living now, In a better way
Eating healthy, & working out
Yo thats everyday
Although these voices in my head, they keep on saying things
I learned to turn, these bitches down
It don't matter, fuck they laughter, I'm underground
Wowing people with sounds, crowds, screaming loud
They know I got It
And now that they want It
I'ma charge, each and everyone of you, mother fuckers
For the fact, that back in the day, most of you didn't love him
But It's cool, I don't hold no grudges
I'm stunting
Remember when I was nothing, I earned respect, like Mc Lovin
No fronting
Had a pessimistic, view of the world
Till I switched, for the sake of beautiful girls, In my life
And I wanna keep em there, buy some square feet
Mileage for my driving, round the island
With my niggas, while we smiling
Steady, drifting, styling
In the clubs, we whiling out
Piling up, pouring shots
Fuck a lifestyle, get your feelings up
Sick of feeling down, get your hands up
Pull your pants up
Anything to get your mind off of the, stress of the day
If only the lord can judge us, why you keep questioning me
It's High life, Its my life
It's my life, reppin the H.I life
It's mine
And I'm a live It, doing it for myself
And doing it for my city
Nothing that you can say, will make me break my commitments
I'll paint a picture, for myself...
Yeah
I'll paint a picture, of myself...
(Outro)

[Verse 1]
Please start dirty
It’s 7:30
Loss of mind and
Cat alertly
My best, your rest
Send your call
And then I nest
Perversity in features
Adversity that teaches
Some call love more
Soon I’ll call the rhythm song
[Chorus]
It’s over
It’s over now
So long to doo-doo-ra
It’s over
It’s over now
I dare not get a look
[Verse 2]
Be yourself
Some let her call
Never fall
See yourself
Sit alone and wait
To my own call
Go ballistic
Anarchistic
Smack my mouth and
Then you kissed it
So long, my gun
Simple run and
Letter bum
Things are looking good on paper
Once when I was in your favor
This kiss from a mess
Send my girl riddle less
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
See yourself
Sad, alone and wait
To my own brawl
Free yourself
There’s an only count
This stands for all of them
Just play at any tempo
Going mad and going mental
All balm, said no
Just to let him put it wrong
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Leaving town I found a flower that I could deserve
Someone moves and someone's bound to get their feelings hurt
I'm loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you you're out of range
As I walked out into a world I feel a sudden chill
I was bleeding put it good onto a daffodil
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted to, you're out of range
[Chorus]
I don't want too much more than
Than to be reborn
In the morning
Reborn so I can feel you
The thorns of bugambilia
I feel you
[Verse 2]
I have your number and I dialed it up a hundred times
Barely there, your voice is cracking up across state lines
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range
Skies of ecstasy we're breaking well I do believe
The tears of God were falling down upon my swollen cheeks
Loving you, you're out of range
Wanted you, you're out of range
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Chorus]x2

[Chorus]
We're all a bunch of brothers living in a cool way
Along with six million others in this place called L.A
[Verse 1]
L.A. is the place, sets my mind ablaze
For me, it's a race through a cotton picking maze
The town makes me jump, it's got a bunch of bad chicks
Well sure, it's got some chumps but I still get my kicks
My body loves to scrump when I lick the ripe pick
Like a come on a thumb
Popping hump, hump, hump, pop out
The action never stops, I'm as wild as can be
Because I'm shooting for the top and my best friend is Flea
Oom Chucka Willy knew the balls to pop
But he never met the Tree so he never be-bopped out hop!
Antwan the Swan, from the pretty fish pond
Was a bad mother jumper, you could tell he was strong
He war a cold paisley jacket and a hellified hat
And between his legs was a sweat young lass
He threw a hundred women up against the wall
And he swore to fear that he'd love them all
By the time he got to ninety nine, he had to stop
Because that's when he thought that he heard a phone
Last night and the night before, I heard a
Fop outside, then I came in doors
Freak out!
Now that I told you a little something about the Flea
A little something about the Tree, a little something about me
I can't leave you hanging but my man Shermzy, he swings the yang, he bangs the yang
And now, it's time to hear him do his playing, you better be burning Sherman!
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Step out!

[Verse 1]
Welcome friends to my thoughts of when
The fax city 4 were four young men
Time has come, now we jam
With the uplift mofo party plan
We're the organic anti-beat box band
[Chorus 1]
We represent the hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
We represent the hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
[Verse 2]
One comes from the holy land
Another was born an australian
Me i'm from michigan
But hollywood is the land of lands
It's a hollywood jam
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
Life is grand in the land of lands
The mind does boggle the mind expands
The anarchy 4 have manned their craft
Get on your knees and shake your ass
To the jam that is
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 4]
We don't ask we demand
That you and your clan
Listem now to this jam
To the power of the drummers bad
It's a hollywood jam
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 5]
There's a party in my town at 12:00
There's a party that's rockin down to the rock
I've got nothin' against hip hop
But there's a party in my town
And no beat box jam that is
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 6]
The party's got girls the girls got hot
The party's got boys and the boys got socks
Something popped the doors unlocked
House got up ran around the block
Sit down house
Take off your blouse
[Chorus 2]
We represent the hollywood kids
Hollywood is where we live
Any good friend of the lollypop kids
Over the rainbow with the wiz
We represent the hollywood kids
Organic anti-beat box band
[Outro]
With the organic anti-beat box band
You just might slam dance that is
It's a hollywood jam

[Verse 1]
She's a witch
A bonafide bore
What's more - she snores
And that is a fact
Cow eyes lie
Yes it's time to resist
How did I ever
Get into this
How could I ever
Have kissed that bitch
So what if she's
Got big tits
[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
[Verse 2]
She came like a cat
Like a cat to cat nop
She came in my lap
With her womanly hips
When I first met her
I came unglued
I played the part of
A blue-blooded fool
I'm through with your sewage
I'm through with your trash
I always knew that I'd
Get the last laugh
[Chorus]
She's the kinda girl
Who changes her mind really quick
She's the kinda girl who
Won't just let things sit
[Verse 3]
Like two trains on one track
Bound for a crash
Two red white and blues we were
Destined to clash
I can't fix the future
I can't change the past
Like fly by night news
We were not meant to last
I'm through with your bluefish
I'm through with your gash
I'm through being screwed with by
You and your wack attack
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Jump back for chump love
You won't be back for cover
But no no no no
I'm no chump love sucker
No chump love sucker[x2]
I thought that your love
Was a matter of fact
But I lost my pride
When I realized that
The smack in my bag
And my baseball bat
Was all you were after
Boys "you dirty rat"
She's a bitch and a brat
And a living disaster
She thought she was fast
But I was faster
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Hair so smooth, black as coal
Oh baby, the way you sway
You wear the dress so very blue
That you take my blues away
She comes and goes, that I know
She cums at least once a day
I can't resist, I kiss your lips [sic]
You're my sexy Mexican maid
[Chorus]
My angel girl she sings to me
Baby, tell me this is not a dream
She's pushing me onto my knees
I'm praying to my baby, she screams
Squeezing me so tight, I cry
I'll love you until the day I die
Let me please get on my knees, I come alone
[Verse 2]
When I wake up in the morning
She greets me where I lay
I look outside to find that it's a bright and sunny day
So serene, she gives to me my toast and marmalade
What more can I say?
She's my sexy Mexican maid
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
She puts me in a bubble bath
She tickles me and I laugh
She washes me until I'm clean
Then she does a little sexy dance
Happy to feel my hand go slap
Upon her sexy ass
We make fun so very slow
Then we make it fast
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
I'm a street walking cheetah with a heart full of napalm
I'm a runaway son of the nuclear A-bomb
I am a world's forgotten boy
The one who searches and destroys
[Chorus 1]
Honey got to help me please
Somebody got to save my soul
Baby detonate for me
[Verse 2]
Look out honey, cause I'm using technology
Ain't got time to make no apology
Soul radiation in the dead of night
Love in the middle of a fire fight
[Chorus 2]
Honey gotta strike me blind
Somebody gotta save my soul
Baby penetrate my mind
[Verse 3]
And I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searching, searching to destroy
And honey I'm the world's forgotten boy
The one who's searching, searching to destroy
[Outro]
Forgotten boy, forgotten boy
Forgotten boy said hey forgotten boy

[Verse 1]
I was not created
In the likeness of a fraud
Your hell is something scary
I prefer a loving God
We are not the center
Of this funny universe
And what is something worse
I do not serve
In fear of such a curse
Shallow be thy game
2000 years, look in the mirror
You play the game of shame
And tell your people live in fear
A rival to the way you see
The bible let him be
I'm a threat to your survival
And your control company
[Chorus]
You'll never burn me[x2]
I'll be your heretic
You can't contain me
I am the power free
Truth belongs to everybody
[Verse 2]
To anyone who's listening
You're not born into sin
The guilt they try and give you
Puke it in the nearest bin
Missionary madness
Sweep up culture with a broom
Trashing ancient ways
Is par for the course
It's fucking rude
To think that you're above
The laws of nature is a joke
Purple sashes feeding masses
Smoke on which to choke
I might be a monkey
When it comes to being holy
Fundamental hatred
Get down on your knees and
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
This is 
my
 time, this is my tear
I can see clearly now that this is not a place
For playing solitaire
Tell me where you want me
This is my time, this is my tear
Coming on strong, Baudelaire
Seems to me like all the world gets high
When you take a dare
Let it rise before you
This is my crime
[Chorus]
All in all and I'm
Loving every rise and fall
The sun will make and I will take
Breath to be sure of this
In the end and then
All will be forgiven when
Surrender rises high and I
Gave what I came to give
Say it now because you never know
[Verse 2]
Devil may cry, devil may care
Distiller's got a scream and now I know just why
When she's moving air
Can you feel the voltage
This is my time
California skies got room to spare
This is my time
[Chorus]
[Instrumental break]
[Bridge]
Take it outside, take it out there
Seems to me like all the world gets high
When you take a dare
In the final moment
This is my time
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Step right up and listen please
You're going to get it with the greatest of ease
Everybody gather round, all aboard the underground
You've got to get in before you get out
And getting out is what it's going to be about
If you find that you are blind
Open your bashful mind
Let my band step inside
And take you on a cosmic ride
With honest sounds I'll paint your brain
For in this song, I do proclaim
That once aboard this moving train
I'll do my best to ease your pain
Slinky as my speech may be
On this trip you'll ride for free
This axis bold as love you see comes and goes so easily
[Chorus]
Space is king or so I sing, subway to Venus
[Verse 2]
Once aboard and feeling smooth
Like a liquid you will ooze
Into a state of mind that soothes
Aw, be my quest inside my grove
Because what I've got to give to you
Is going to make you wiggle like a wiggley worm
Because you deserve to wiggle and squirm
Life's too short to be in a hole
So bust into your funkiest stroll
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Take your body, shake it around
Do the dog on the ground
And if I can't make you dance
I guess I'll just have to make you piss your pants
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough: wants to get it paid off
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 2]
God knows when but you're doing' it again!
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coonskin cap by the big pen
Wants eleven dollar bills: you only got ten
[Chorus 1]
Look out, kid
Look out, kid, it's something' that you did
Look out, kid, cause they keep all hid
[Verse 3]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talking at the heat put plants in the bed but
The phone's tapped anyway, Maggie says that many say
They must bust in early may
Orders from the D.A
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 4]
Walk on your tip toes, don't try "no doz"
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plain clothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 5]
Looks to me like you did
A little to much hitting' kid
You should've took it to the bridge
Before you started to skid
[Chorus 2]
Look out, kid
The good god willing, we'll bebop to Bob Dylan
Chilling em, thrilling em, and red hot killing em
Killing em
[Verse 6]
Get sick, get well, hand around a ink well
Ring bell, hard to tell if anything is going to sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, write braille
Get jailed, jump bail, join the army, if you fail
[Bridge]
But users, cheaters, six time losers
Hand around the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters
[Chorus 1]

[Verse 1]
Stretching out your tightness
Good enough to make you grow
We are all in favor of this motion
Stretching out your tightness
Time to open up your hole
When it rains, I let myself get wet
I have always wanted to
Give something to my brother
Proposing to expose your head
Just something that is like no other
[Chorus]
I'll stretch you out
I'll stretch you out, my friend
I'll stretch you out
[Verse 2]
The juice that flows from intuition
Is my liquid fare
We are all in favor of the open end
Three pounds of love and knowledge
Are expanding in my skull
Truth be told, we let the good times roll
I have always needed to
Receive it and believe it
And it's making and creating love
Tender titillation
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I'm a fish and I can swim all day
I can swim in so many ways
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
I'm a bird and I can fly away
I can shift in so many shapes
Make it up as I go along
That way it is never wrong
Owwwwwwww....
[Bridge]
There's a glowing up around the moon
It is showing
We want to play in the water that is flowing
[Verse 4]
Very legendary
Extra planetary fairy
Varied truths, she's making just for you
Yes I have always wanted to
Give something to the stranger
M-m-m-moving to improve the groove
A mental transformation
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
All of my love and most of my fears
Been coming on strong for most of my years
Add up and end up in a song
Cellophane tweeds and revenue streams
Are blocking my shots and killin' my dreams
That showed me how to be the cause
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, hey ah what now?
[Chorus]
It's a lifetime of a strange man, that's right
It's a long time, for me, I see
She wants to belong and, I want to be free
Ex-communicated cause there ain't no guarantee
Ooh ahh, yella, ooh ahh, yeah
[Verse 2]
All of my friends and enemies
They were part of this dance
That put me right here we go
So glad I got this chance
Better known plans and lesser known schemes
Were all about love and less about me
I'd have to say she wore the pants
That's oh!
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Woo! Yeah
Ahh go Oh
I've been left[?]
[Chorus][x2]

[Chorus]
Stranded
Stranded on a toilet bowl
Stranded
[Chorus]
Stranded
Stranded on a toilet bowl
[Verse 1]
What do you do when you're stranded
And there ain't nothing on the roll?
To prove you're a man
You must wipe it with your hand
[Chorus]
Stranded
Stranded on a toilet bowl!

[Intro][x2]
She's stone cold bush, yeah
And baby that's alright
[Verse 1]
Get up off your knees, come on walk with me
Tell me what you need to get along
A statue come to live
I cut you with my knife
Bleeding to the tune of dolly dagger
[Chorus]
She's stone cold bush
[Verse 2]
Height street's got nothing to show
Except the skirt on your ass
When you're living on the streets
You've got to let it roll
Get on with what you've got
Aw, everybody knows that it's alright
You've got no secrets to tell
But when you walk that walk and talk that talk
You do it oh so well
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Sweet China doll, her thighs
An animal in pain, she starts to cry
Her pipes are open wide
She blows more than my mind
Echo sounds of soul
Time after time
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well, my young lady, she lives
Three houses away
She claims that she can hear moaning and screaming
To me fucking you every night
Well, let me say "hey"
[Chorus]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on, party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2]
Struck by lust in a telephone booth
Busted by a cop, he said "That's uncool"
He said that he hears moaning and screaming
To me fucking you every night
Well, let me say "hey"
[Chorus]
[Chorus]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy
[Chorus]
I want to party on your pussy, baby
I want to party on your pussy
I want to party on your little pussy, girl
I want to party on your pussy
[Bridge]
Let me shine your diamond
The girl got a scratch
Slap that cat
Have mercy
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Next stop on the KLM
A two lips and a sturdy stem
A funny thing always happens when
I get a heavy jam
I'm going to turn it into hydrogen
[Chorus 1]
I I, I I, I I, I I I I, I
[Verse 2]
Cowgirl and a troubadour
MGM and the lion's roar
A straight shot to the corner store
I want to show you what
I want to show you what your head is for
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
So much I wish I could
So many I wish I would
So much I wish I could
Count on you not to deplete me
[Chorus 2]
So much I wish I could
So many I wish I would
So much I wish I could
Count on you not to defeat me
[Chorus 3]
Please don't turn away again
Please don't turn me into them
Please don't turn away a friend
Please don't turn me into them
[Verse 3]
Stand by for the great eclipse
Rip it out now shake your hips
Backing off the apocalypse
I got to loosen up
I got to loosen up to get my grip
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2][x2]
[Chorus 3]
[Outro]
Please don't turn away again
Please don't turn me into them
What you're going to give them now, oh now

[Chorus]
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for
[Verse 1]
Nothing major or too complicated
Just a friendly wager that we orchestrated
For someone, someone
Cut my heart out
With a feather
And put an end
To any extra pressure
For someone
[Chorus]
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for
[Verse 2]
Ride around on mellow waves of mercy
And fill the space with lack of controversy
For someone
Someone
Set it up to follow you
On my aeroplane
Here's a present
For the future memory lane
Someone
[Chorus]
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for
[Bridge]
Light it up the room
She sang into any twane
Hit 'em up cause you got me
A mop to your plane
Someone
[Chorus]
There are no worries for someone
Life's in no hurry for someone
There are no worries for me
[Outro]
For me[x3]

[Verse 1]
Flashing lots of cash and spending lots-o-loot
He’s sitting at the bar – then he’s sitting at the booth
Across the dance floor he does scoot
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
The caboose that could he goes toot toot
Been known to gag and sometimes puke
A very good friend of Granny Goose
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
[Chorus]
Skinny sweaty man in the green suit
[Verse 3]
He’s half man and half cartoon
But good buddy don’t be confused
He’s full blooded looney tune
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Face to face with the man in the moon
His family doctor is Doctor Seuss
If you catch him in your soup please don't shoot
He's the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
He was new in town
A free wheelin’ clown
A very funny young duke
Hanging under the roof
Of a place in time
United sound
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
He’ll play a little guitar sing a few blues
He’s the kind-a-guy that you can’t refuse
Despite the fact that he’s no brute
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
Strike the magic groove make him jerk and move
Like an eight legged freak in snake skin boots
Coming soon to a theatre near you
He’s the skinny sweaty man in the green suit
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Everybody knows about Hollywood skunks
Soulfull sex and funky monks
My tencil town is made of steel
Let's whimp, let's shout, let's make a deal !
Hollywood and Hollywood not
We are so lively on the spot
Feel so alive, don't know where to stop
Are you def or dumb or what?!
[Chorus 1]
Silly little creature, Sikamikanico
Sitting on a bleature, Sikamikanico
I don't want a teacher, Sikamikanico
If we're going to reach ya, Sikamikanico
[Verse 2]
Don't you know about Frank Sinatra
That's all gone because I got up
We don't just play, we display
Got to give it up, gotta do it my way
Shooting my sex upto the cave
You might receive my radio wave
Shake it girl, you won't get hurt
I knock my dick into the dirt
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
Anybody want some, Sikamikanico
Everybody on the run, Sikamikanico
Rock it more breeza, Sikamikanico
If we're going to treasure, Sikamikanico
[Verse 3]
Hey, Ho, Let's go
Mother Fucker, wanna be a jigolo
Let me demolo how it goes
Under ho sittin on my big toe
Hey Joe, a radio chump
I'll never going to overcome in Hollywood, I'll come alone
Oh no, it would now leave my nose that you blow
Hey ho, let's go
So big boy say you want bad news
We doubt our mama's been confused
It's plaing to see we rock the groove
If you don't like it, time to move
And all the press, you don't amaze me
I'm not your dick so don't appraise me
Never going to fit your critical shit
You better watch out, you might get hit
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
In a world that can be so insane
I don't think it's very strange
For me to be in love with you
I want to know more than your brain
[Verse 1]
Into my life you were injected
Not something that I expected
Now I smile from your affection
We have made a soul connection
Just for whom does your bell toll
Don't be cold show me your soul
[Chorus 2]
Sentimental Gentlemen are not afraid to show you when
I am you, you're my best friend
Show me your soul
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 2]
Yes, I find you so appealing
When you show me how you're feeling
You, my friend, should not be kneeling
Open up and start revealing
Trust in me my heart is sole
I need to see, show me your soul
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1]
[Verse 3]
Don't expect too much from me
Perfection is no test for me
Because the best I'll ever be
Is just like you: A human being
You won't offend, I need to know
Please, my friend, show me your soul
[Chorus 2]
[Chanting]

[Verse 1]
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact
It was our shoulder space
That made the perfect place
For the magic of the cup
To style out with grace
With a tight turn twist
And a slight swerve swank
The brothers cup kissed
With a kick ass clank
[Chorus]
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
[Verse 2]
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the pop of a snap and the flip of a flap
The cups went up like a natural fact
So love all your brothers
And love all your sisters
Love all the misses
And love all the misters
Don't be shy when you're sharin' your kisses
The brothers cup kiss
And we ain't sissies
[Verse 3]
It is our notion that the perfect peace potion
Can be found in the wake of the green sea's motion
The long rocking swell of the mighty blue ocean
Is the cradle of peace it's the perfect peace potion
Give it up to this planet full of strife
We're the brothers cup cuttin' sharp as a knife
With the power of the cup we are about to astound
All your preconceptions they will come unbound
We are the brothers cup coming to your town
Bringing tubs of love we're going to spread it around
[Chorus]
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up
We are the brothers cup
We like to get it up

[Verse 1]
Floozies at the rainbow
Superstars that won’t get far
Who is who that we know
Coochie coo is at the bar
[Chorus 1]
Do you really love
Do you love do you love
Do you want to make the call
We all long, we all fall
[Verse 2]
Shoelace for the sirens
Groupies and the tyrants ply
[Chorus 2]
Do you really want
Do you want do you want
Do you want to have it all
We all long, we all fall
[Chorus 3]
I’m so tired
Well I get by
But I could use a few
I’m so tired
That I slept
Along the way
[Verse 3]
Suitcase of perception
Rhinestones and redemption cries
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 4]
I’m so tired
The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
I’m so tired
That I slept
Along the way
[Chorus 5]
Do you really love
Do you love do you chase
Do you take this town today
We all long, we all face
[Chorus 3]
[Verse 4]
The sun beats down
Upon my lonely face
A perfect world
With all its perfect places
I could use a few
For just in cases
[Outro]
And I’m so tired
That I slept
Along the way

[Verse 1]
Each time we have a quarrel
It almost breaks my heart
Because I am so afraid
That we will have to part
Each night I ask the stars up above
[Chorus 1]
Why must I be a teenager in love?
[Verse 2]
One day I feel so happy
Next day I feel so sad
I guess I'll learn to take
The good with the bad
Each night I ask the stars up above
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
I cry a tear
For nobody but you
I'll be your lonely one if you should say we are through
Well if you want to make me cry
That won't be so hard to do
If you should say good bye I still go on loving you
Each night I ask the stars up above
[Chorus 1]
[Chorus 2]
[Chorus 1][x7]
