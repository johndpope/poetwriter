[Poison Pen talking]
Yo, this Poison Pen
The album, its called The Money Shot
[Immortal Technique talking]
Most of yall muthafuckaz
Yall ‘Don’t even know what your rights are
You think your rights the opposite of your left (ahaha)
We have these rights, guaranteed to us
(Poison Pen – You ain't taking my burner nigga)
And once they get revoked...
(you gotta cut my finger off nigga)
Bueno es hora de revolución muthafucka!
[Immortal Technique]
I keep a burner stashed
Loaded up with hollow tips
Cause’ politics can turn your city into the Gaza Strip
Military industry, justify sales like a drug dealer lyrically
Fucked up physically
But halving two sides doesn’t imply symmetry
Cause’ Philly to Filastin, our children are fricassee
Times up, like the Celestine prophecy
My paper is folded now, no more chances to copy me
Them ghetto philosophies will get yourself killed
If I don’t sell them the product “somebody else will”
America, like it or not, I represent you
You teach me and sell me the weapons to use against you
My stray hands used to sack cities for New York bitch
Now im Alaric
, 
Gaiseric
, 
four seventy six
Smart muthafuckaz from the hood learn history
Stupid niggas never learn shit and die religiously!
[Hook: Poison Pen and Immortal Technique]
Rebel Armz Locked and Loaded
The only law once the government is corroded
(2nd Amendment)
My life might be intense
But my rights will not be infringed
(2nd Amendment)
Is it propaganda for weapon companies
Or necessity in the country we see
(2nd Amendment)
Yeah, know this ___________
Not for whilin’ just for checks and balance
(2nd Amendment)
[Poison Pen]
I walk around town with the pound strapped down on my side
No frontin’ just incase I gotta smoke somethin’
Sa gloves just incase I gotta choke somethin’
Hawk out just incase I gotta poke somethin’
Dirty dirty just incase I gotta go huntin’
Open case in the city, I don’t know nothin’
Random macs (no) you wanna play my circle?
My pedigree is made to _____ you
But we’ll hurt you!
[Immortal Technique]
Reverse AIDS commercial
Death equals silence
Anarchist, El Violen, reactionary violent
Cursed music out of a red violin
Only republicans I fuck with live in Northern Ireland
Warrior chief liken the beast from the east
Drive-by in the drive-thru, we share beef with police
One for the Bronx, for Queens, for them Oakland streets
Fuckin’ empty the clip in em’ for my peoples in Greece
Nigga!
[Hook]
[Poison Pen]
Mr Obama, congratulations on that win
Don't take away my right to hold my llama
I’m a citizen, like that dude in that militia
No felonies, unlike that dude in that militia
Antebellum statues paved the way for me
It’s registered with the state dawg
Its day of the siege
Police won't protect me, the beast won't protect me
I stand back to back with the gats with Technique
We called "Rebel Armz" for a reason
I defend hoods with heaterz
Like Condoleeza’s pops
Pack off, Pop off, on them evil cops
Torch yours, I torch mine
That's when the bleeding stop
Tryna’ confiscate mine
So you can catch and drive my grey piece
I’m Haiti in the seventy nineties (Sak Pasé)
Control em’, border
The government sponsored slaughter
We supreme
Revolution, how this land was founded
[Hook]
[Immortal Technique talking]
Yeah, Immortal Technique, Poison Pen
Stronghold / Rebel Armz
Hahaha
You gotta know your rights pussy
So that, when they break the law on you
You know how to break the law on them
Hahaaha...

Tony Kenyatta, what up baby?
[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Supreme Godhead, gutter like poverty
Righteous man is one of forty six parts prophecy
It’s epicyclical orbit like the hypotheses
It’s metaphysics that borders on the philosophy
Another song of yours is just another disaster
Another verse of mine is just another cadaver
You could call it a Genesis of another chapter
You could call it the 
venom
 that’s from the troubled rapper
The same rapper that was known for just smashing your face in
Who is God? What’s material manifestation?
I’m indestructible, 
my actions are that of a Mason
Yamasee Native American tribe of relations
The judge threw the book at me, I take it in blood
The rook move horizontally, basically drugs
A nation of intellectuals, a nation of thugs
Jesus is hate, a nation of Satan is love
[Hook: Poison Pen]
With a fist full of twenties
, got my mind right
With a fifth full of henny
, we Team Homicide
We swing side to side, so what’s happening’?
So what’s crackin’? So what’s stackin’?
If we falling out, then we brawling out
Vinnie chalk ‘em out, ain’t nothing to talk about
Team Homicide, swing side to side, so what’s happening’?
Yo, what’s happening? It’s all that shit...
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Me and my conglomerates shall survive Apocalypse
I charge a price for telling people what the process is
Living in a world where dictatorship is obvious
Natural resources running out for the populace
Murder doesn’t need a lobbyist or an ambassador
Ask the survivors of the Mỹ Lai massacre
‘Back to the Future’ without the flux capacitor
Kill you for the gold like Colonel Gaddafi characters
You bath salt sniffin’ zombies fuckin' a stranger
Navajo skin walkers, nigga, I’m a face changer
Surgically remove your heart, bury it at Wounded Knee
A microcosm of the graveyard that Earth is soon to be
A eulogy for those chasing cars and jewelry
I’m stocking food and water cause shit ain't what it used to be
I’m motivated like Buster Douglas when his mother died
Border Patrol, nigga, see you on the other side
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Planetary]
Battling Plan's a bad plan
I'm raw like cats from Afghanistan with gats in their hands
From Philly to Pakistan 'space packin the stands
You make all fake thugs start acting like Stans
You'll never make your move cuz you lackin the fans
I been illin' since I had a backpack full a cans
You see life pass by you in the blink of an eye
Thinkin you fly, we'll choke you in the sink till you die
You spit lava rap, so holla back if need be
You'll burn if you step, believe me, come see me
I'll make you see moons in the break of day
And make sure that your body slowly starts to decay
It's gruesome, 
I had to add my two cents
The next movement in rap guess who's sent
Outerpsace nigga, and we demand we eat
And if not we gonna leave a bloodbath in the street nigga
[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
They asked me, concerning the spoils of war
Such spoils are the disposal of God and the apostles
So fear God, and keep straight the relations between yourselves
Obey God and his apostles if ye do believe
I'm so confused, take the world away
[Verse 2: Crypt the Warchild]
I'm a maniac, you need to watch who you war with
You in the land of stars when the block is enormous
Squash rocks with my hands, my palms is enormous
Flow the hot lava that I drop when I scorch it
Droppin candy rappers that get chopped up and snorted
Newborn kids they get chopped up, aborted
Planet warchild, when we pop up report it
Committin riot acts so we constantly torch it
Illest Puerto-Rock this whole process is morbid
Equipped with slaughter blocks, you get the picture-a portrait
If it ain't monetary, what's your reason for touring
All that shit you pop, to be honest it's boring
Been rockin the mic since before inter-corporate
You need to sit back and let your conscience absorb this
Before you ship that demo to them dudes in the office
Come test your skills for real in hell's fortress
[Interlude: Vinnie Paz]
I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth
Holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth
Or on the sea, or on any tree
I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise
Having the seal of the living god
He cried with a loud voice to the four angels
I'm so confused
To whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea
[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique, I live life strangling death
I walk through the land where the fallen angel is kept
But I will never bow down to a Pagan habit
Like Roman gods that were faggots named after the planets
The connotations of Revelation taken for granted
Mark of the beast, government microchips implanted
I'll be branded a maniac for speaking the truth
And I'll be murdered as soon as I hit the street with the proof
Illuminati trying to raise the devil at any cost
They probably cloned Jesus with the blood off of the cross
And I know that it's the same mother fuckers I see
That genetically engineered HIV
Controlling the population according to mathematics
Generated by Masons and the military industry
Sponsoring terror, creatin the profit margin that'll last forever
The crusades and Vietnam sand-blasted together
And you believe in "whatever", even a Federal promise
But the spawn of Shaytan could never be honest
And poor people pay homage and pray to a god
That the Vatican themselves don't really believe in
Cuz they'd rather worship money and the physical demons
Without biblical reason I execute em for treason
I don't need an alibi
, 
cuz my place in history is the book of Malachi
Motherfucker
[Outro]
Immortal Technique; Harlem, New York and North Philly
The Angels of Death are here you motherfucker
We'll turn your cities to salt, nigga
Y'all ain't shit, and none of your peoples are shit
None of your children are shit
You'll all be dead tomorrow, you fake motherfuckers
What!?

[Intro]
What do you see when you're in the dark and the demons come?
I see you. I see you standing over the grave of another dead President
[Hook: Bazaar Royale]
I see angels above me
Demons below me
Fighting over heaven, heaven, heaven
It's real
[Verse 1: stic.man]
America's nightmare; young, black, and just don't give a fuck
Run up in the courtroom and wet 'em up
Got nothin' to lose
 
but my handcuffs
Every man must choose to lay down or stand up
It's war time, everything is fair, no fear
When they say the homie murdered the judge, I don't care
Fuck 'em, he deserved it, long as the homie get away
And don't get caught for the crime, I encourage it
We rootin' for the vellein of black
Pourin' out Absolut, salute, niggas is shootin' back
In self-defense
 
we bang the pistol like
Larry Davis
 
or Brian Nichols
Every pig, every public official, the boomerang
Is coming back to get you, you reap what you sow
The system you created created a monster
And now you scared cause it's coming back to haunt you
[Hook x2]
[Verse 2: M-1]
Since we gonna take the blame, I'mma rep my name to get my aim right
Let's have an overthrow and after party in the same night
Same height as
 
Huey
, 
same muscle build as Malcolm
With the same circumstances in the hood, you know the outcome
And read it in the news about your sergeant and your captain
Don't take this as a warning, just another nigga rappin'
Fuck the way we organizing, fuck the training and the grapplin'
And fuck them 
Uncle Toms
 
who call police because we smack them
And fuck you sympathizers with your middle class reactions
Cause we bangin' on the system, G'd up
, 
fuck the factions
And if you didn't know, the 
G
 was for 
George Jackson
And long live his warrior spirit packin' the Magnum
Watching over the soldiers, 
knowin' niggas be blackin'
When we really need to be disciplined in our ways and actions
When we get some freedom you niggas can start braggin'
Till then, inside the blood of my eye, you see the dragon
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
I'm like the birth of baby Mohammed, the movement I started
Can spar with the hardest, the martyr regarded as Spartacus-hearted
It doesn't matter whose missiles can shoot the farthest
When 
you're a target in an Afghan Teutoberg Forest
Close quarters combat over corrupted elections
Bilderberg 
is like cancer, it grows an infection
Nepotism
 
is the gold and the conductor's connection
And ignorance is the prison that the people are kept in
The military ain't there for the people's protection
They're just there to protect an investment
That's why people get arrested, electrocuted, molested
Connected streets are infested with those
 
tired of protestin'
Traumatized children grow to guerilla garrisons
9/11 generations pale in comparison
And you will learn a lesson repeated through history
That no matter what you think, occupation is not victory
[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Somalia, Kashmir
Nigeria, 
Palestine
Iraq, bring it back
[Hook x2]

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Ayo, you're blind to the fact, cause you're a coward and a dreamer
A pussy like Nazis hiding in Argentina
Pop shit, I'll catch you quicker than a misdemeanor
And put you in a fucking box next to Selena
Cause I'm the meanest motherfucker you could ever imagine
Incarcerate the universe inside a single atom
But since the populous can't fathom space n' stars
I spit razor-blades that cover your face with scars
Killing you on the spot like you saw the face of God
Empty the clip in you and load 16 for your squad
Dying is easy, but living with Satan's gonna be hard
I spit revolutionary bars that'll touch ya'
Bolshevik status; murder you, like the King of Russia
And on your tombstone chisel "Fake motherfucker"
Cocksucker, I played you
Cause I'm the God, but I wouldn't send my son to save you
I gave you the pieces to reconstruct the world and the past
But all you could was ridicule the future and laugh
So Imma' split you in half, 
machine gun to your belly
And then I'll piss all over your little sister like R. Kelly
I got more connections than illegal selling microchips
To hunt you down after I destroy the mic when I spit
Immortal Technique bitch!
I'm a real lyricist
Other people just use Jay-Z as their ventriloquist
Now run and tell your boss, you mothafuckin' snitch
[Verse 2: D. Rymz]
Most cats can't remember me cause my brain shaking energy
Mentally hitting victims so hard they lose they memory
And generally, you'd rather go to hell than be my enemy
You're meant to be with a foot in the chest, there's the penalty
Divide then mutilate drum beats
Before I touch a MC in the cypher,
 I lubricate the tough piece
Spin against his Earth till' his reality's reversed
So when he spits his best verse, it comes out as his worse
So life begins in a hearse and ends it with birth
So everything that he hate, he loves until it hurts
My logic is sick
All you chumps gotta get sticked
Hot as the clip that was dipped up in the bottomless pit
With knowledge equipped
I thieve on the foolish
Reason I knew this
Jesus and Judas, Caesar and Brutus
David Goliath, I'm seizing Divine
You heathens are blind
Be warned, I storm like all four seasons combined
Carve your extremities like mob in the Genovese
Heat the part of the brain in charge of the memories
Dudes done forgot how we starved in the 70's
Sons continuing wars
Our fathers were enemies
In these dark spots the Don bomb like the Lebanese
The wicked trying to replace God with celebrities
You heard me
The wicked trying to replace God with celebrities
[Hook x2]
Too real
Too fake you trying to be
My powerful words something you ain't trying to see
A real lyricist, in depth, so honor me
I am what you not
I'm an anomaly

[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
The system
, 
can never stop what's been set into motion
Like volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean
My purpose is to burst to the surface
Immersed in the 
smoltering
 lava from verses
Surrounded by, murder mamis not bitches that's worthless
I cut chicken heads off
, 
like hexes and curses
, 
weapons I purchase
Make Homeland Security nervous
; 
I run, pockets and purses
Like subway searchers
 
robbin masonic temples disguised as churches
I'm busy so I'll leave that one for you to interpret
Three serpents of merchants from military industry murder
The beef is eatin up, like the mad cow in your burger
Fathom the cause of cattle cannibalism
Factory farms, are like a fuckin animal prison
The microcosm of, Adam Smith's capitalism
America's pagan religion given as the mark of the beast to the Christians
A destruction of, Babylon, that's my mission!
[Refrain: Immortal Technique]
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of 
political hostages
Motherfuckin right soldier, this is the apocalypse!
Everywhere Tech and them go, the Feds watchin us
Clockin the world through satellites like binoculars
We fight for the release of political hostages
Waitin for 2012's burning apocalypse
[Verse 2: Akir]
Sex, drugs, and murder, webcams and burgers
Check scams and lurkers, test scans to purpose
Sect crams to further, death plans and workers
Get canned you nervous as you step, plan that hurts us
It's demand to be purchased, we can care if you serve us
We programmed to be 
perfect
, frequent handed the serpents
An amazement on purpose, see I'm amazin my earners
But now the tables is turnin
, got my hand right on that curtain
Hit the stages and burn it, with these pages I earn this
Can't take it, I'm nervous while fake enemies perp'in
Foul energies worth and, crowds' ears'll be perkin'
Take it somethin disturbin and it's hurtin for certain
Yearnin to get my turn in, workin to get a word in
Been in the scene observin while I'm learnin how the system's worked and
Capitalistic merchants tryin to make a million urgent
Constructive revolution confusin how the world's burnin'
[Refrain x2: Akir]
Everywhere I get 'em go
, the beast watchin us
Know we got 
the spot
 in control, they got binoculars
When we be, out on the road they try to follow us
You never gon' silence this, this is the apocalypse
[Verse 3: Pharoahe Monch]
You have now acquired an 
old cyrus
 hybrid, 
work 'til
 my 
third iris
Chip inside my brain projects scriptures onto my eyelids
Celibacy, 
virtual sex, avoid the virus
Secretive shit that I did will put the city at high risk
The 
mentalist,
 the temple that houses the wisdom
It's like, Malcolm X calculus amalgamated algorithms
They say "Pharoahe, teach me about the system"
Nigga boot me in your computer I'll give you acute astigmatism
See through Windows, Word, Pharoahe's the Mac Intel
Bit off the Apple, plant seeds, spit crack Excel
Lyrical FireFox, the verbal Explorer
Who metaphors the industry to 
Sodom and Gomorrah
 for ya
They profit from water, they'll profit from oxygen
Pharoahe the prophet says that this is the apocalypse
We livin in these last days, use your optics what the topic is
The coppers got binoculars, they'll probably try to knock us cause
[Refrain: Pharoahe Monch, Immortal Technique]
[PM] Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Satellites observin the fulfillment of the prophecy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no 
apologies
[IT] Cause none of you got an apocalypse insurance policy
[PM] 
Everywhere Pharoahe goes, the Feds watchin me
[IT] Fascism breakin out of the cocoon of democracy
[PM] Middle fingers up to the sky with no 
apologies
[IT] 
Iraq was just practice for the urban war philosophy
[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Ha ha ha, AH-hahahahaha
It's burnin in here, call the Fyre Dept
Akir, aiyyo Pharoahe
They ain't never gon' find this shit man
Ha ha ha ha, like the weapons of mass destruction

[Hook 1: DV Alias Khrist]
This game is cold, I told my broad I won't be coming home
I lost my job, I lost my mind, lost everything I own
The city got me fucked up.. yo these pigs got me fucked up..
Music on the radio is fucked up, I hop in the truck and only want to feel the pain
[Hook 2: Chino XL]
Chino XL, and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!
[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
What the fuck happened to rap? I need to put my lyrical clip in
It’s on homie, gun clapping is back
These pop acts make me wanna pop gats
This whole shit is fucked up coz radio just broadcast trash
Surround the wack, blast my semi-auto tracks
Launching deadly hollow caps and taking out the whack
And many follow that, swallow that...
I’ll burn you vocal like a bottle Jack
You thought you had the streets coz I was gone
Well we just got ‘em back! Homie you can check my team
It’s super ugly when you get us all together, Sick, Tech & Chi
This reign of terror won't end with me
I spawned a little psycho coz my baby momma kept that seed
Now I'mma take a little trip to these radio stations
Grab them punk ass DJs, wave guns in their faces
If they don’t play my shit then it’s “Welcome to Hell”
Coz all we want is Immortal Tech, Chino & the Psycho Realm!
[Hook 1]
[Hook 3: Chino XL]
Immortal Technique and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Psycho Realm and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Chino XL and fuck everybody else!
Fuck everybody else! fuck everybody else!
Real lyricists and fuck everybody else!
All my street soldiers STAND UP!
Arm yourselves!
[Verse 2: Chino XL]
Chino’s ill, slap off your cosmetics
I arm myself like a veteran putting on prosthetics
My barbaric genetics bring pain
The only Revolution that you’ve ever seen is Prince’s group in Purple Rain
Deranged monster is sponsored
You get shit on and pissed on like Tila Tequila at a Juggalos concert
Ain’t tryna be glamorous, hammers we snap like cameras
I’m fuckin’ intense like teenage camp councilors
Spit blood through your stereo, there we go, time for your burial
Fag niggas, after you rhyme say no hetero (hahaha)
My murderous sentences, no secrets where my weapons is
Locked in the closet next to pop rappers' sexual preferences
Amber alert, your girl's mouth ran away with my kids
If you’re sick then I should be diagnosed with three days to live
You slip I kidnap you and give you a mean death
Beat you with your Blackberry till there's barely a screen left
Jack and Tech my dawgs like Andrés in the Philippines
My mistress is villainy, rape and pillage ‘em lyrically
My symphony's sinfully biblically loved by killers
Who gives a fuck who’s the greatest rapper alive as-long as Chino’s the illest!
[Hook 1]
[Verse 3: Immortal Technique]
Fuck a silent Revolution, soldier, I'm on the warpath
I’ll throw my commandments down on your platinum calf
You'll get your face slashed like a Rikers Island reminder
Behind ya snipers will find ya whether you run to China
Or try to crawl the fuck back in your mother's vagina, (bitch!)
And I don't need a fuckin' co-signer
 (hahaha)
To murder gassed up underground niggas like coal miners
Bring it back paying homage to the old timers
I was bred as a carnivore, bred as a cannibal
Flow sicker than pictures of people fuckin' animals
Like a car crash ripped in half neck to the crotch
Muthafuckas scared to stare but they secretly watch
Niggas wanna play Shaytan? Well let's get it on
I fire missiles like the fuckin' shit that hit the Pentagon
You not strong enough to do a song with me I'm the truth
Like Tina Turner motherfucker, you'll get raped in a booth!
[Hook 1]
[Hook 3]

(Verse 1)
JS-1
, 
Technique
, L.I.F.E. Long, Yo
I only role with two masta turntablists
Goose with ya record making wax and needles kiss
Not these amateurs only relying on playlists
My man JS-1'll make vinyls say ouch, from the cuts and scratch
Even Technique can vouch, why your DJ's just learning to speak with hands
Most these jockies ain't really moving no jams
Just sittin back gettin' under the table payola
Weak mixtapes with MC's writing tracks with crayola
My peeps be fader freakers spinning crate exclusives
Jugglin wax, got ears vibing off the new shit
While wannabe DJ's got me sleep during they mix
I feel like slicing an axe and detaching fingertips
Now all you gotta do is take note
And watch real turntable technicians show ya'll the ropes
Respect due to DJ's who represent every day all day
Let this shit here play
(Hook)
This for the DJ's who play the real Hip-Hop
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
Turntablers...Audio 
Technician
JS on the wheels of steel
Can, can break a beat, cut, scratch and transform
{JS-1*scratches*}
Ground original
...
I don't need MTV I can smash your clique like 1,2,3
(Verse 2)
Yo...
I conduct guerilla warfare throughout the PJ's
On the government controlled by wack DJ's
Playin' watered-down commercial cause a payola
Taking orders from the label on the 2-way motorolas
Spit solar rays on DJ's who think they raw
Right before I break your fingers off on a car door
And I'm give your girl a C-section with a chainsaw
And graffiti my name with the blood stains on the floor
Hardcore on a fake turntablist brotha, you wack niggas blend
Like yellow and purple colors, motherfucka nobody wanna hire a decoy
You couldn't spin in the club as a fuckin B-boy
Cause juvenile cats don't get the big picture
, 
gimme dat Vestax
And go back to your Fisher Price mixa
I'm about to hit ya like da pentagon after I take off
Yo JS-1 cut this mothafuckas face off
{JS-1*scratches*}
Train train train and chuck chuck chuck
{*continues scratching*}
Cut cut cut, cut like a guillotine
{*continues scratching*}
Any questions?
(Hook)
This for the DJ's who play the real Hip-Hop
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
Turntablers...Audio Technician
JS on the wheels of steel
Can, can break a beat, cut, scratch and transform
{JS-1*scratches*}
Y'all original...I don't need 
MTV
 I can smash your clique like 1,2,3
(Fade)

[Intro]
This hip-hop verse is somewhat of a change, somewhat of a revolutionary exchange
See, in fact this is going to be directed to all the Uncle Toms of the 20th century, and the 21st century to come
See, cause they think propping up, but we prop up too
Here we go...
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Immortal Technique disperse perverse verses
The gospel of fallen angels heading below the Earth's surface
A sermon written by the CIA for Catholic churches
I make you look back on your life and think that it's worthless
Murderous curses leave the population nervous
When I burn it's beyond recognition
This song is a mission; bomb your position
How you gonna read the future, nigga?
When your palms are missing?
I'm stronger than corrupted religion
Stuck in the system of syllables I chopped up over intervals
I'm the sickest most ridiculous nigga
Sicker than sickle cell, sick of my cell
A white man's prison, a brown and black man's hell
I flip the topics from universal to microscopic
Burn out your optics and make you listen to me
Like conservative America's, motherfucking version of history
But now I'm reconnected with the culture you stole
Lyrical symmetry enter two gun shots in your soul
The cops shot Diallo right in-front of his home
And 
Giuliani
 don't got a conscience like 
Ariel Sharon
Rappers are clones manufactured by the industry
Dismantled, but now produced independently
The government wants to take away freedom of speech
And it becomes real when niggas don't prosper or teach

[Intro: Mos Def]
Man you hear this bullshit they be talking
Every day, man
It's like these motherfuckers is just like
 
professional liars
You know what I'm sayin
It's wild
Listen
[Hook x2: Mos Def]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
Bush knocked down the towers
Tell the truth, nigga
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I pledge no allegiance
Nigga, fuck the President's speeches
I'm baptized by America and covered in leeches
The dirty water that bleaches your soul and your facial features
Drowning you in propaganda
 
that they spit through the speakers
And if you speak about the evil that the government does
The Patriot Act
 
will track you to the type of your blood
They try to frame you
And say you was trying sell drugs
And throw a federal indictment on niggas to show you love
This shit
 
is run by fake Christians
Fake politicians
Look at they mansions
Then look at the conditions you live in
All they talk about is terrorism on television
They tell you to listen
But they don't really tell you they mission
They funded Al-Qaeda
 
and now they blame the Muslim religion
Even though Bin Laden was a CIA tactician
They gave him billions of dollars
 
and they funded his purpose
Fahrenheit 9/11
That's just scratching the surface
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They say the rebels in Iraq still fight for Saddam
But that's bullshit
I'll show you why it's totally wrong
Cuz if another country invaded the hood tonight
It'd be warfare through Harlem
And Washington Heights
I wouldn't be fighting for Bush or White America's dream
I'd be fighting for my people's survival and self-esteem
I wouldn't fight for racist churches from the South, my nigga
I'd be fighting to keep the occupation out, my nigga
You ever clock someone who talk shit, or look at you wrong
Imagine if they shot at you
And was raping your moms
And of course Saddam Hussein had chemical weapons
We sold him that shit
After Ronald Reagan's election
Mercenary contractors
 
fighting a new era
Corporate military banking off the war on terror
They controlling the ghetto with the fear of attack
Tryna distract the fact that they
 
engineering the crack
So I'm strapped like Lee Malvo holding a sniper rifle
These bullets will touch your kids and I don't mean like Michael
Your body be sent to the morgue
Stripped down and recycled
I fire on house niggas
 that support you and like you
Cuz innocent people get murdered in the struggle daily
And poor people never get shit and struggle daily
This ain't no alien conspiracy theory
This shit is real
Written on the dollar underneath the Masonic seal
[Eminem]
I don't rap for dead presidents
I'd rather see the President dead
It's never been said but I set precedents
)
[Hook - Mos Def]
[Eminem]
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours

"I want the world to know you won't beat us because we're the children of those who took the worst fall, of slavery and brutality that ever lived, that ever existed. Our parents survived the Middle Passage. Only the strong got here, and then we lost our name, our culture, our religion, and we're still here. So you may have a momentary victory Mr. Bush, but you don't know who we are."
[Immortal]
I pledge no allegiance, fuck the President's speeches
What the industry did to 'Pac they did to Jesus
Raping his vocals and then destroying the message
Tryna deport us if they can't destroy and arrest us
Government front religious, but their heart is empty
Like a televangelist preaching out of his Bentley
Calling abortion murder in a medical building
But don't give a fuck about bombing Iraqi children
Talking like units in the fucking libretto
Look at their mansions and look at your suburban ghetto
The gulag
, the new hood where they send us to live
Cause they don't give a fuck about none of our kids
That's why Blacks and Latinos get the worst education
While devils run America like "Birth of a Nation"
Affirmative action ain't reverse discrimination
That shit is a pathetic excuse for reparations
[Hook: Immortal + KRS]
Bin Laden didn't blow up the projects
It was you, nigga
It was you, nigga
(Bush knocked down the towers)
It was you, nigga
(Bush knocked down the towers)
It was you, nigga
[Immortal]
They say that terrorism revolves around the Qur'an
But that's stupid, I'll show you why it's totally wrong
Cause if this country was invaded and crumbled
I'd turn Harlem into a Columbian jungle
And I wouldn't be fighting for a Christian nation
I'd be fighting for survival from extermination
I wouldn't fight for Fox News, them racist niggas
I'd be fighting for the hood, for the faceless niggas
For the immigrants America loves to despise
Even though it needs them to make the economy rise
They feed us genetically modified garbage
So I repetitively reload the cartridge
Boston, New York, down to Atlanta
Guerilla war in the swamps of Louisiana
Camera panoramas of hammers couldn't rock me
East coast to West coast you can't stop me
And fuck Schwarzenegger, his pops was a Nazi
And it runs in the family
 so run for the Grammy's
Run to the coon picnic and try to pick up a mammy
But half of y'all are faggots trying to pick up a tranny
Eddie Murphy ass motherfuckers going commercial
Even Interscope is getting pimped by Universal
Green Tutankhamen Lantern I curse you and murked you
But the Bin Laden slush fund remix just worked you
[Hook]

[Skit from 'Planet Of The Apes']
Beware the beast man, for he is the Devil's pawn. Alone among God's primates, he kills for sport or lust or greed.
 
Yea, he will murder his brother
 to possess his brother's land. 
Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours
. 
Shun him; drive him back into his jungle lair, for he is the harbinger of death
[Poison Pen]
Yeah! 
Immortal Technique!
 
SP the Ghost!
 
Poison Pen!
 
Vinnie Paz!
We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, call your number out, send your uncle ??? out
We gonna stomp em out, run them out, run them out, nigga ain’t nothing civilized about no uncle ??? nigga, you feel me? Don’t bring no uncle ??? out nigga, fuck outta here
[Immortal Technique]
All troops in formation? Let the siege commence!
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Back like I was locked up, putting in work
Burning through books like Nazi's in a Catholic church
I'm cursed like Cain when he murdered his brother
Cut your face off and wear it while I'm fucking your mother
I'm Mars Ultor, the avenger, the god of war
And if you don't believe in me, I doubt you believe in God at all
I breathe smokeless fire, the Jinn type
That'll make you hate the way that Allah made you to live life
Like Hindu, niggas that be bleaching their skin white
Other people's teeth in my hands after a fist fight
I was born with a sixth sense and a swift right
Skinned werewolves and rape demons at midnight
Sell your kids into slavery after we murder you
Or sacrifice them in the same fire we burnin' you
Barbarian funeral, nigga, you wanna know?
Damn the river, bury me, and let the water flow
[Hook: Poison Pen]
Chaos, mayhem, bang outs, slay them, uprise, rape them, raid them
Cage em, pandemonium, insurgent, death merchants, commit the best murder
Pillage, Kill them, erase history, make them a mystery
[Verse 2: Styles P]
Cut the nose off, the ears off, the whole head
Immortal and Ghost
 coming, 
code red
You never seen a black barbarian
Warrior, warlord
, 
pussy, cut your balls off
More bodies come, more bodies hauled off
What you want the sword and get shit sawed off
Your throat need an axe in it
And I'm breaking your back because your spine needed a crack in it
You bugging me, I'm coming to fumigate
The Wolverine, the Sabretooth, the way that I mutilate
I'm like the viking in Valhalla Rising
Except I got black skin and both of my eyes in
Don't test him, please don't stress him
He'll hang you from a tree with your own intestines
How you wanna die? Make your own suggestion
Now talk to the lord and make your own confession
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
You pussies
 
living in a movie theatre
Put the motherfucking spell on you like brujeria
Chop his motherfucking head like a ruthless leader
Guns drawn in a church service, shoot the preacher
You need to be godly to know Allah
Ain't no rappers eating around me, like a broken jaw
It ain't ever been a day that I ain't broke the law
What you think I hold a motherfucking
 
toaster
 for?
I ain't going there, there's police in that room
And Vinnie walk around with 
bags of dust
 
like a vacuum
Bury you under the earth inside a black tomb
My body covered in 
Dashiki
 and 
stab wounds
I'm a guerilla, barbarians is my ancestors
That's a part of my neurological transmitters
We Islamic and brought the story
 of 
shem
 with us
While we brought the motherfucking blam blam with us
[Hook]
[Outro]
The walls have been breached! Advaaaaaaance!
We came in the name of peace and brotherhood, you wanted us bound in slavery, poisoned our water, changed our names...
Burn their homes, take their jewels, skin them alive!
Hold on, hold on, hold on...
No one will know these people ever existed, and all that will be left is what we build upon their ruins...

[Produsert av Tommy Tee]
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Bambaataa told us knowledge was the fifth element
Truth behind the lies is what the music represents
So how the fuck you gonna have a peace settlement? (How?)
When people want a piece of your land to build settlements
There’s all different kinda terrorism you can perpetrate
Every dead body causes karma to circulate
There’s suicide bombin' buildings full of civilians
Or cutting off water to cities full of children
You can’t try to justify collective punishment, (Why?)
Our country never finds peace with bodies buried under it
I guess some Americans just don’t remember
There’s a slave graveyard under the World Trade Center
Stop the criticism of Iranian nuclear fission
Until mutual nuclear disarmaments’ the mission
This ain’t about religion, Muslim, Jew or Christian
It’s about people making money off of that division
[Verse 2: El Tipo Este]
Sin que medien armamentos
Digo siempre es buen momento
Pa iniciar entendimiento
Es demasiado el desencuentro, siento
Que el respeto debe ser boleto al parlamento
Es el respeto el primer paso
Sino lo que sigue es cuene
Es un complejo asunto cuando tiempo son cientos de años
El premio al mayor daño para los de menor tamaño
Me empeño a no estar de acuerdo con ninguna posicion que implique
A lo mas tu adversion de discriminacion, brother
Violencia intolerancia en cualquier forma de expresion
Mas alla de cualquier religion, vision de obsesion
Boicot, boycott, boikott
Hay que hacer no solamente hablar, boicot Israel
[Verse 3: Tumi]
I am recognizing that the voices in my head
Are urging me to be myself and never follow when I’m lead
So with that said, it’s as urgent, see as we come from some things
I am anti Zionist
 and many fundamentalist
The devil’s in the specifics, mix him with your favorite dish
You can beef with Israel and not be anti Semitic
Don’t buy beef from Israel, ‘cause you paying to kill them kids
So if you rockin’ this shit, go ‘head do the Gaza Strip
My heart race when I hear a politic from off their lips
We have lifted, 
missed Olympics,
 
seen “Free Mandela” pickets
And this image has been repeated, a little street for village children
Even feeds from pissin' ‘cause of global criticism
Of this horrible system boycotted by the citizens
[Verse 4: Tonto Noiza]
Il n'y a qu'un pas d'hypocrisie à la diplomatie
Rester là assis devant la situation assis
C'est pas l'image que j'ai d'un homme droit
Car l’immunité qu'Israël s'octroie me choque moi
Regarde la pauvreté d'un peuple
Comment relativiser
C'est le pouvoir qu'il faut briser
J'viens viser sans stigmatiser
J'suis pas venu pour stigmatiser
Comme l'ONU, ni attiser la haine
Mais l'inégalité qu'la mauvaise fois entraîne a décuplé ma peine
C'est aux instances dirigeantes que je m'adresse car on agresse
Aux prix d'erreurs passées c'est tout un peuple que l'on oppresse
à tous les opposants de tous les camps que cette lutte emporte
L'addition est plus salée que la Mer Morte faut qu'on l'emporte
[Verse 5: Don Martin]
Granater regner over Gazas tak
Treffer sykehus, treffer barnehagebarn, treffer sovesal
Det er klart det er snakk om en Apartheid-stat
De bygger opp en mur mellom
 seg og de som ikke skal ha borgerskap
For hvis du kaller noe pro-palestinsk
Så plutselig gjelder ikke regler du kan tro at det gir
En helt makaber annen klang til ordet "Blodappelsin"
Om den er dyrket I stjålet jord og gror fra et lik
Ikke I mitt navn, ikke for mine penger
Det holder slettes ikke å sitte rundt og grine lenger
Så vi må ramme fundamentet, vise Israel
For de driter helt I resolusjoner likavel
Bare en liten del av et mye større bilde
Som når vi boikotta Shell da jeg var mye mindre
Ansvaret ligger hoes oss alle, så vi vil ha med
Alle med samvittighet, boikott Israel

This is 
Immortal Technique
Harlem, New York
All over the world
And this is The Martyr
If you are listening to this
It is your responsibility
To burn this for every single motherfucker you know

[Verse 1]
They say the odds against me, are crooked and impossible
Like I was born with a hole in my heart is an obstacle
I was left to die by the doctors, in the Children's Hospital
But I never lose hope, success is psychological
The world is volatile and the street is my education
Shaping the nation, like the blueprint of a Mason
While Shawshank record deals get you raped on occasion
So I'm focused on my economic situation
I'm like the little kids on TV that dig through the trash
I hustle regardless of the way you talk shit and laugh
A lot of niggas drop science but they don't know the math
Because their mind is narrower than the righteous path
It's funny how on the block niggas will kill you for cash
But never raise the gun and cry out "Freedom at last"
The cold war is over but the world is still getting colder
Atlas walking through the projects with the hood on my shoulders
I would like to raise my children to grow to be soldiers
But then the general, would decide when their life would be over
So I work hard until my personality split
Like the Black Panthers, into the Bloods and the Crips
They said I would never be shit, but now I sit and reminisce
Like 
Yeshua ben Yusef
 
flipping through Genesis
Ignorance is venomous
, 
and it murders the soul
Spreading like a virus running rampant
, 
but out of control
[Hook]
So if I should ever fall and get caught in a hustle
Let them know that I died while I fought in a struggle
From the hoodrats to the rich kids lost in a bubble
Spray painting on the streets and at the subway tunnels
Write it down and remember that we never gave in
The mind of a child is where the revolution begins
So if the solution has never been to look in yourself
How is it that you expect to find it anywhere else
[Verse 2]
Immortal Technique in the streets, back on the hustle
Cause three strikes will get you life for stuffing cracks in a duffle
Upstate behind steel gates attacked in a scuffle
Razor blades stuck on the side of pencils, hacked to your muscle
But the emptiness is what bleeds you to death when it cuts you
And its the lawyers, not the inmates scheming to fuck you
Trying to fight the system from inside, eventually corrupts you
But that's what you get when you put a corporation above you
And it's the people that love you that seem to hurt you the most
Sometimes when they die you find yourself cursing their ghost
But you make success, nobody delivers your fate
Sometimes you give and you take,
 
since prehistoric vertebrates
Crawled out of the lakes,
 
and that's the truth about life
Or to do it to ghetto and your car, rims, and your ice
Because even though we survived through the struggle that made us
We still look at ourselves through the eyes of people that hate us
But I'm going to make it regardless of the trumped up charges
And semi-automatic barrages, that empty the cartridge
Post-traumatically scar kids that try to be brave
Because niggas backstab each other just to try to get paid
Turn cannibal like knights during the crusades
Afraid of responsibility; addicted to greed
Beating their girls purposefully losing a seed
As if we were bound to the destiny we used to receive
[Hook]
I used to wonder (I used to wonder) about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way that they portrayed us to everyone else
That cursed us, then only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurting ourselves
I used to wonder (I used to wonder) about people who don't believe in themselves
But then I saw the way that they portrayed us to everyone else
That cursed us, then only see the worst in ourselves
Blind to the fact the whole time we were hurting ourselves
I used to wonder {*echo*}

[MC Caness]
I stay a mile high like Denver
So I say, I better spit a chorus with a style I'll remember
So when you're spittin' it starts gettin' wild in the center
Rippin' it gifted like a Christian child in December
And gettin' it lifted like when I'm eatin' out blunt lips
You gettin' it twisted by speakin' 'bout dumb shit
Your young ship, I run shit from drum kicks to tongue flips
With Parallel Thought, it's much deeper than a cunt gets
[Wordsworth]
Choruses connect in my verses, raise the curtain
The crowd in unison has us connecting in person
Views so you know the titles of my songs vibe and sing along
What they ask for when you buy it in the stores
Without a hook you would OD from my bar supply
You need a break before your brain and your heart subsides
Give you a chance to turn it off or listen to the rest of it
Show you that I'm beyond and for y'all it's best to quit
[Karniege]
This is a great song stupid
Eight bar brutal when I cook you a hook that'll shake y'all noodle
Like hockey writers, smackin' a poodle
Put your hands up, that'll make 'em get cookoo
Straight jacket racket, kids unusual
Karniege swing buildings, "Yo where Brookey go?"
To another time zone, C-3PO
Funky like B.O., BB just ease yo
[Double AB]
These A&R's appall us, like "Nice verse but we want a chorus
Then you'll be larger than a dinosaur is."
So fuck a Brontosaurus, cause the shit I drop off the top enormous
Yo my shit is hot, get your fire insurance
They ask Double AB for catchy hooks
But all I rap about is Gangsta Bitches, that's the joint Apache took
So when they ask for hooks, this is what AB will do
Hook you up to feeding tubes, that's what you'll be eating through
[Interlude]
I'll tell you what kid. You'll never fuckin' be good enough. You'll never be good enough to sing in this fuckin' town, I'll tell you that. You'll never make Chorus Line. You ain't no Wonder Woman
[Tame One]
Trife I live it and give it all
With chickens for lickin' my balls and shaft, if not they haulin' ass
On blast cause even with no check
I gets low neck from chicks in projects with no sweat
Cause the heat's off, no threat
Here, here's my cell, you can yell at who you go get, tell 'em "get at me"
Let's be diplomatic, I'm [?]
Like Jim Jones, I've been grown
Since the only thing for me to fall back on is my ass
I'mma sing songs for cash on flask long as it last
Dead ass
[R.A. The Rugged Man]
Yo
Haters don't like us, we write this for 25 to lifers
In Rikkers and Harley Davidson riders and bikers
We Warriors, can you dig it like Cyrus?
 It's like a jungle sometimes
Lions and tigers want to ignite us and light us on fires
No cost, no platinum cards
Relaxing, back massage, ghetto ass rap stars
In the club flossin', I'm broke actin' large
Smooth secret garden, I'm the pale El DeBarge
Sho' yo' right
[C-Rayz Walz]
What you need to catch fish with
The Candyman's weapon of choice
Peter Pan's arch nemesis is this shit
Just don't let me connect one to your cheek
Cause if I do
You will tongue kiss your teeth for a week
Kareem Abu Jab y'all
I stay hittin'
Low dunks
But if the beats bangin', they'll listen
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
(Why?)
I am the hook
[Thirstin' Howl III)
The hook
With the line to follow
The real, the beaches define the model
Money, hoes, clothes still do them all
On the magazine cover of "Dude Was Poor"
Polo king
Oh yeah mayne
I'm the Goya bean
Still takin' all ya bling
[C-Rayz Walz]
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
I am the hook
[Klu Sheisty]
I am the hook, but that's just the half of me
I'm a walkin' weed spot you should ask for me
Got The Hook-Up like Master P, passin' trees
Guaranteed you'll be hooked from a blast of these
I'm a real dirty hook, stop actin' sweet
I hang dead cows up, don't ask for beef
I'm a real grimy hook to a nasty beat
I'm a real hot cook cause the rap's is heat
[C-Rayz]
Just don't let me direct one to your cheek
Cause if I connect
You'll tongue kiss your teeth for a week
[Sean Price]
Yo
Hook rap
Pirates, pot poets cook crack
You look wack
Hurricane game, sneakers on, fuck is wrong with ya?
Sean is a killer
Sean a gorilla
Ape in a tree
'Bout to scrape your date off some E
Back flippin', gats spittin'
Sell crack rappin' dude
Back smack a few rappers who rap with an attitude
Sixteen bars, bring in the hook
Sixteen scars, y'all niggas is shook
Who called police?
[Swave Sevah]
Ayo, fuck how many bars it take
I'mma keep spittin' rapid fire darts till the target break
I'm gon' be direct and get my point across in 8
Spit 16 out of this world if you lost in space
24 make you walk off with your chin in your chest
32 end your career, put your spirit to rest
This niggas a threat, just give me a track let it cook
I stop when I'm ready, I don't give a fuck about a hook
[Poison Pen]
Watch out for the hook, jeah
Eight bars, four bars, two bars
Most of y'all flakes is fubar
Niggas with no bars abuse 'em
Most of the rappers in Texas don't use 'em
Stupid
Right hook homie, bust up your shit
The wrong hook homie will bust up your wrist
Clutch up your fist
Don't fight with me
Get hit with so many hooks y'all should pay me ghost writing fees
[C-Rayz Walz]
What you need to catch fish with
The Candyman's weapon of choice
Peter Pan's arch nemesis is this shit
Just don't let me connect one to your cheek
Cause if I do
You'll tongue kiss your teeth for a week
Kareem Abu Jab y'all
I stay hittin'
Low dunks
But if the beats bangin', they'll listen
That's why my style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
(Why)
I am the hook
[Thirstin Howl III]
Hook
Like prostitution
Pussy free everywhere is the top solution
New York slang, choose your gang
Still in all do ya thang
White bitches show me love before Jeezy knew what snow was
Hook
Longer than methadone clinic lines
Did it fine, didn't mind with pigeon primes
[C-Rayz Walz]
My style is the science of jooks
I am Demetrius Mitchell
I am the hook
[Immortal Technique]
Fuck a chorus
Straight cancer like Phillip Morris
Burning like magnesium phosphorus
Top of the food chain, tyrannosaurus
It's saber tooth, bloody truth
Ripped from under my tongue in the booth
Psychotic youth
Fucked in the mind
Monkey wrenching their own plans, stuck in they grind
A sign of the times
A forthright flooded with neo-nazis
And haunted by the souls of murdered Iraqis
No chorus can stop me
Motherfuck 'em
[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Hahaha. Fuck a chorus nigga. Stronghold. Immortal Technique. C-Rayz Walz. Uh. Like that. Hahahaha

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
I’m at the drug lab trying to figure out my next move
I’ve gotta make this raw street hop break through
This criminology rap that slash fake crews
Like insanity that make front page news
I’m the head trauma that makes your scarface bruise
MCs nowadays lose with bars they use
There’s a war between Heaven and Hell
Which do you choose
No matter what side homes, you gotta pay dues
My central intelligence was birthed in my residence
Downtown tenements were grim and no elements man
I live my life while the wicked try ending it
My brain’s more fucked up than joints with a stem in it
Your weak shit I’m deading it, all for the cause
I’ll be crucifying your lies live on a Jesus cross
We hold our own court when truth is the judge
I got hollow jurors that give out guilty verdicts in blood
[Refrain x2: Cynic]
These words that I live by
One day I might die by
Make my mom cry
Will this shit get worse for me
The CIA murder me
For talking in third degree in a state of emergency
[Verse 2: Cynic]
Still make the world panic
More than gang faggots lead masses
Go beyond banging, fuck religion
Meditate with the poised
I’m ramming horns with the Jewish
I’m talking ? moves than speak agnostic when I walk through Jerusalem
Cleanse you, come and swell out your Lakota-Sioux
We’ve been through the stars
Seen the birds named Jesus
His ink clues write truth aimed to wake the youth
Before they waste their talent end up locking a shoot
C’mon, I’m culminating when I’m in the meridian
Illumination, fuck being an idiot
A master mason when I’m building my pyramid
Medicine man blowing up the schools of Americans
I’ll let you go tell a friend
Determination to leave my fam
In war to cross dope we kill a minuteman
I’m living paranoid
I think it’s the end
July tenth the Earth wept when I took my first breath
[Refrain]
[Verse 3: Chace Infinte]
We dealing with a system designed
To confuse niggas minds
And it’s worse when the people divide
Fighting titans, ruling the Earth’s tyrants
Evil alliance trying to blind us and changing the ancient god sciences
Instead of taking knowledge and applying it
The devils reversed the knowledge and gave us the spell of leviathan
God became dark, meaning a dark star
Represented by Anubis am I losing y’all
Hope y’all ready for war
I be busting
To the trumpets blow to signify the end for us all
With a tent, a canteen and 
a chrome .44
Not dealing with man’s rituals but with God’s laws
And I know I’m on the list for the things that I spit
The government act as if the artists are terrorists
They terribly pissed because the kids listen to this
And get influenced by the music so they can’t tell em shit
This is rebel music
Nigga raise your fist
The words that I speak
A nigga live and die by this
I’m just a poet with an ancient soul
A master teacher that knows how to break down and speak in codes
[Refrain]
[Verse 4: Immortal Technique]
Far from pitiful my young mind harboured a criminal
Like the spirit of a nigga you murdered that lives with you
It's complicated
I'm obligated
Were confiscated to conquer hatred
And replace it in the people I'm faced with
Prison Planet fanatics complain to the Matrix
While we facing life in prison in the prism inside the Matrix
We like Texas instruments, programmed to be basic
Cause the mother land was victim to a cultural rapist
So it murdered for political freedoms
The evidence
Look in the Bible
Wasn't Moses a terrorist
And he was one of the greatest
Prophets that ever lived
That showed freedom is not something enemies ever get
So what if I could make the Mississippi run red
And the angel of death left every first born American dead
Would God's messenger be like the Unabomber
Or Americas karma that'll rip through your body armor

Look, let me make something abundantly clear for people
That are so bereft of activities
They feel like they gotta comment on every one of mine
First of all, being a vegetarian should never be associated
With being a revolutionary or being open minded, that's a dietary choice
If someone wants to proliferate the type of ignorance
We're supposed to be fighting by thinking that, you're just fucking yourself
I don't go around promoting beef and poultry shoving it in peoples faces
I don't castigate people for not eating steak sandwiches
And I would never diss someone for being a fucking broccoli head
Or living off radishes or eating grass with tofu
I like a lot of vegan cuisine but the illogicality
Of expecting everyone to adopt your particular idea
Of what being healthy is, is just preposterous
I've seen some of you herbivores, and if you wanna argue health
Y'all need to eat some kind of supplement
Because some of y'all are so skinny that it's disgusting
Lookin like the only hip hop motherfuckas on Schindler's list
Being a malnutrition ass got nothing to do
With being revolutionary or being on point
I'll be damned if I let somebody else push their agenda on me
You know, 
I don't eat pork, not cause I'm a Muslim
I just don't really like it,
 
but I really will fuck a bird up
And fish is good when that shit is fresh
It's like my nigga Vast Aire from Can' Ox said
If you don't like the smell of burning meat, then get the fuck off the planet
You know, I don't criticize people for eating moss
And don't open your fuckin mouth about my food man
I like beef and broccoli motherfucka, mind your God damn business
Matter of fact, you know what? I'm out
I feel like asome 
arroz con pollo
, a 
banana daiquiri
And a motherfuckin 
bistec apanado

[Intro]
Like anybody, I would like to live — a long life; longevity has its place. But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Promised Land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the Promised Land. So I’m happy, tonight. I’m not worried about anything. I’m not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
The ghetto is like a prison with invisible bars
No matter where you at, it always follows you where you are
And it's hard out there for a pimp to get out of
But it's harder for the hooker that he beat the shit out of
I got niggas underground in the Confederate states
Ironically running from slavery that prison creates
So I never hate on the South: I respect their vision
I just hate on niggas that promote Samboism
And white execs that love to see us in that position
They reflect the stereotypes of America's vision
They want us dancing, cooning and hollering
Only respect us for playing sports and modeling
More than racism: it's stay in your place-ism
More people are trapped in practical blackface-ism
So fuck a Civil War between the North and the South
It's between field niggas and slaves that are stuck in the house
[Hook: Chuck D]
Civil war for the soul of a nation
This is a struggle to save civilization
Demonstrations overthrowing the occupation
The annihilation of 
mental colonization
Civil war for the soul of a nation
We fight for the future of our civilization
Destroy the corrupt government organizations
Trying to survive cultural assassination
[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
Crip niggas, Blood niggas, eses, Asians
Why the fuck we warring with each other's population?
The devil wanna dead all our population
People and Folk Nation, why the separation?
Why we got Jamaicans hating on Hatians
When the British and French raped both nations?
Mexicans and Blacks kill each other, straight hating
While the government profits from prison population
If you on the bottom, be you Anglo or Asian
You gotta recognize the realness of what I'm saying
You gotta recognize another G ain't the enemy
When the police ride, they kill us frequently
We gotta make the youth see where the truth be
If you a G, then grow and develop GD
50 years of gangs and our people still poor
If we really run the streets, we should really end war
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Brother Ali]
Our hearts were torn apart just like y'all was
Watching towers full of souls fall to sawdust
Everytime we called your office you ignored us
Now you holding hearings on us all inside of Congress
Microscopes on us, ask if we're jihadists
My answer was in line with all of the Founding Fathers
I think 
Patrick said it best: Give me liberty or death
I shall never accept anything less
You claim innocence, you play victimless
But you gave the kiss of death in the name of self-defense
Slavery and theft have brought our nations to the end
Of pacifying your citizenry with excess
We believe in freedom, justice, security
But they're only pure when they're applied universally
So certainly if I rage against the machine
My aim was only to clean the germs out of the circuitry
Heard you need putting fear inside your heart
Make you 
burn Qu'rans
 and 
tell me not to build a mosque
Me, my wife and babies we ain't never made jihad
We just want to touch our heads to the floor and talk to god
Ask him to remove every blemish from our heart
The greatest threat of harm doesn't come from any bomb
The moment you refuse the human rights for just a few
What happens when that few includes you? Civil war

[Speech: Dr. John Henrik Clarke]
Nearly all religions were brought to people
And imposed on people by conquerers
And used as the framework to control their mind
My main point here is that if you are a child of God
And God is a part of you, then in your imagination
God is supposed to look like you
And when you accept a picture of the deity assigned to you
By another people, you become the spiritual prisoner of that other people

[Verse 1]
Immortal Technique, disintegrates mics when I spit
I cause more casualties than sunken slave ships
Full to capacity, I bring tragedy to rap without my man Khadafi
The government took Nazi scientists from Germany
To design nuclear rockets and ways of observin' me
Cause heir pathetic attempts, didn't work to murder me
When this country was conceived, these bastards never heard of me
But now I hold the souls of slave masters eternally
Bleeding internally, 
burgundy
, during surgery, verbally
Cause I'm a spirit to which devils are incompatible
I've been around since the planet was inhabitable
I spit in the ocean and created microscopic animals
Which evolved into two species, the righteous and the cannibals
But until then, I had alien women suck me off
When God said "Let there be light", I turned it the fuck off
And that's the reason Earth is only 5 billion years old
I made the sun shine, and permitted time to unfold
The surface was lava, but when I stepped down, it became cold
Fuck what you've been told
My spiritual form became a swarm of molecule sickness
Manifested liquid trapped inside a mountainous region
Until the sky started raining, continuous seasons
Immortal Technique, at long last, reincarnated
Un-debatably reinstated to leave you decapitated
Je suis fou, but my crazy words make sense
I'll split every pound in your body into six pence
I'm sick of simple similes about The Sixth Sense
I'll leave your body drenched in the blood from all your ancestors
You'll never be at peace, like the souls of child molesters
I'll cut you and bless your festering wounds with alcohol
Drown you in a clogged toilet, in a public bathroom stall
I'll rip you down, take a chunk of you home like the Berlin Wall
This is the final call, for all rappers that wanna brawl
Immortal Technique, the wrong motherfucker to diss
Cause I allowed God to let you motherfuckers exist
[Verse 2]
I'm the Stronghold on your neck that doesn't let you breathe
Stronger than the fake image of God in which you believe
More dangerous than your ignorant ass could ever perceive
A European virus, mutated in Africa, overseas
Transported by mosquitoes and fleas to where you live
So lock yourself in your house with your wife and your kids
You're such a bitch, somebody probably made you out of a rib
My arrest record just scratches the surface of what I did
My bid locked me up and brought my life to an end
I was forgotten, abandoned by my bitches and friends
You don't want beef with people like me
, 
so don't pretend
I'll resurrect your aborted baby and kill it again
You get no props in hip-hop like feminine men
I'm iller than any plague God gave Moses to send
You wanna make amends, cause I'm the reason that the earth shakes
Buryin' your fam like Central American earthquakes

[Verse 1]
I never make songs to disrespect women
Or to judge people about the way that they're living
But the way I am is based on the life I was given
Like them white boys, losing my religion
I used to be a Christian and a political pawn
The Bible is right and all your native culture is wrong
Next thing you know you telling me 'bout making a song
Come in the studio, and tell me that I'm making it wrong
Pissed off cause reality is making us strong
Like the ghost of 
Timothy McVeigh
 
making a bomb
'ey yo Marvin Gaye, what the fuck is going on
These rap niggas made propaganda out of your song
But it's the Gong Show, amateur night at the Apollo
My dick is like my music, but harder to swallow
So children follow me, like the Pied Piper
And sing the chorus in the air, with your blunt and your lighter
(sing that shit nigga, right now)
[Hook X 2]
You played yourself thinking your down with me
I end your life nigga, don't fuck around with me
And if you kids can't listen, then your bound to see
The way you get shot for crossing the boundary
[Verse 2]
The second verse is worse than the first in this respect
Scripted specifically to keep people in check
Harlem to Boston, real niggas spit with me
But Landspeed, you ain't fucking shit to me
And underground labels know that I don't trust you
You're only independent till you're major, so fuck you
And if your pissed off cause you think that I dissed you
I rape your moms and we can make this a personal issue
Dance with the devil, remember that you're not on my level
Stupid your not ready, I won Disypher, Bragging Rights from Rocksteady
And practically every battle that they got in New York
And I still murder rappers on the street for sport
Doctor Guillotine cutting you short little man
But you don't give me props cause I never won at Scribble Jam?
Well fuck you, I hope somebody you love dies, so fuck your crew
And fuck your family too, Technique's at it bitch
What the fuck you gonna do?
[Hook X 2]
(
Yeah, Wrap it up on these niggas, wrap it up, Yeah
)
[Verse 3]
Immortal Technique incinerates degenerate fags
Burn Trent Lott, wrapped in his Confederate flag
I got the Beretta with my face wrapped in a rag
So put the African slave jewelry in the bag
Motherfuckers tell me, that a diamond is forever
But is it worth the blood of Malcolm and Medgar Evers?
House niggas get your head severed trying to be thug
You don't concern me, I'm trying to hurt the people you love
Word of mouth is I'm in the club being sneaky
I'm like the body snatchers, and your girl is getting sleepy
I murder you indiscreetly, right at the source
Like the Roman Legionnaire who stabbed Christ on the cross
This is about you, though; it ain't about Jesus
And you shouldn't fucking talk about telekenesis
Nigga please, moving shit with your mind
Try moving ya moms out the projects with your rhymes
And next time, I'm coming after 'cualquiera', profanity
Fucking '
carajo maldita mierda
'
Roll up the hierba, y pasala, para la izquierda'
Put the price up to listen to me pop shit
Cause I got Martha Stewart giving me stock tips
Underground money with honeys up in the whip
Bangbus.com, nigga fucking your bitch
Yeah, played yourself nigga
Fuck all ya, you don't know shit about me
Why open ya mouth and discuss who the fuck I am
I thought I told ya niggas on volume one, I wasn't fucking around
You just slept, cuz you sold a few thousand units in the golden era
When niggas would buy anything on the shelf
But those days are through, and you are through with them

[Verse 1]
I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
His primary concern, was making a million
Being the illest hustler, that the world ever seen
He used to fuck moviestars and sniff coke in his dreams
A corrupted young mind, at the age of thirteen
Nigga never had a father and his mom was a fiend
She put the pipe down,
 
but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
He started hanging out selling bags in the projects
Checking the young chicks, looking for hit and run prospects
He was fascinated by material objects
But he understood money never bought respect
He built a reputation cause he could hustle and steal
But got locked once and didn't hesitate to squeal
So criminals he chilled with didn't think he was real
You see me and niggas like this have never been equal
I don't project my insecurities in other people
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
So he felt he had to prove to everyone he was evil
A feeble-minded young man with infinite potential
The product of a ghetto-bred capitalistic mental
Coincidentally dropped out of school to sell weed
Dancing with the devil, smoked until his eyes would bleed
But he was sick of selling trees and gave in to his greed
[Hook]
Everyone trying to be trife never face the consequences
You probably only did a month for minor offences
Ask a nigga doing life if he had another chance
But then again there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Dance forever with the devil on a cold cell block
But that's what happens when you rape, murder and sell rock
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
[Verse 2]
So Billy started robbing niggas, anything he could do
To get his respect back, in the eyes of his crew
Starting fights over little shit, up on the block
Stepped up to selling mothers and brothers the crack rock
Working overtime for making money for the crack spot
Hit the jackpot and wanted to move up to cocaine
Fulfilling the Scarface fantasy stuck in his brain
Tired of the block niggas treating him the same
He wanted to be major like the cut throats and the thugs
But when he tried to step to 'em, niggas showed him no love
They told him any motherfucking coward can sell drugs
Any bitch nigga with a gun, can bust slugs
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a blood
Even Puffy smoked the motherfucker up in a club
But only a real thug can stab someone 'til they die
Standing in front of them, staring straight into their eyes
Billy realized that these men were well guarded
And they wanted to test him, before business started
Suggested raping a bitch to prove he was cold hearted
So now he had a choice between going back to his life
Or making money with made men, up in the cife
His dreams about cars and ice, made him agree
A hardcore nigga is all he ever wanted to be
And so he met them Friday night at a quarter to three
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
They drove around the projects slow while it was raining
Smoking blunts, drinking and joking for entertainment
Until they saw a woman on the street walking alone
Three in the morning, coming back from work, on her way home
And so they quietly got out the car and followed her
Walking through the projects, the darkness swallowed her
They wrapped her shirt around her head and knocked her onto the floor
This is it, kid, now you got your chance to be raw
So Billy yoked her up and grabbed the chick by the hair
And dragged her into a lobby that had nobody there
She struggled hard but they forced her to go up the stairs
They got to the roof and then held her down on the ground
Screaming "Shut the fuck up and stop moving around"
The shirt covered her face, but she screamed and clawed
So Billy stomped on the bitch, until he broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doing
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped moving
Blood leaking through the cloth, she cried silently
And then they all proceeded to rape her violently
Billy was made to go first, but each of them took a turn
Ripping her up, and choking her until her throat burned
Her broken jaw mumbled for God but they weren't concerned
When they were done and she was lying bloody, broken and bruised
One of them niggas pulled out a brand new twenty-two
They told him that she was a witness of what she'd gone through
And if he killed her he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
He thought about it for a minute, she was practically dead
And so he leaned over and put the gun right to her head
[Sample from "Survival of the Fittest" by Mobb Deep]
I'm falling and I can't turn back
I'm falling and I can't turn back
[Verse 4]
Right before he pulled the trigger, and ended her life
He thought about the cocaine with the platinum and ice
And he felt strong standing along with his new brothers
Cocked the gat to her head, and pulled back the shirt cover
But what he saw made him start to cringe and stutter
Cause he was staring into the eyes of his own mother
She looked back at him and cried, cause he had forsaken her
She cried more painfully, than when they were raping her
His whole world stopped, he couldn't even contemplate
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And he remembered how his mom used to come home late
Working hard for nothing, cause now what was he worth
He turned away from the woman that had once given him birth
And crying out to the sky cause he was lonely and scared
But only the devil responded, cause God wasn't there
And right then he knew what it was to be empty and cold
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
After that they killed his mother, and never spoke about it
And listen cause the story that I'm telling is true
Cuz I was there with Billy Jacobs and I raped his mom too
And now the devil follows me everywhere that I go
In fact, I'm sure he's standing among one of you at my shows
And every street cypher listening to little thugs flow
He could be standing right next to you, and you wouldn't know
The devil grows inside the hearts of the selfish and wicked
White, brown, yellow and black colored is not restricted
You have a self destructive destiny when you're inflicted
And you'll be one of God's children that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
So when the devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because the dance with the devil might last you forever

[DJ Green Lantern]
This is an invasion, an occupation
Immortal Technique, the evil genius DJ Green Lantern
And you're now in the state of guerrilla warfare
It has been spread by the superpowers of the industry
To the 3rd World underground of the streets
This is for all those who've been labeled extremists, maniacs, terrorists
Shit.. Welcome to the 3rd World
[Immortal Technique]
Yeah.. Yeah..
Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
[2x]
Invasion and rampant monetary inflation
That brought us all to the footsteps of this nation
Peruvians, Haitians, Ecuadorians, Nicaraguans, Colombians, Salvadorians
They call us terrorists after they ruined our countries
Funding right-wing paramilitary monkeys
Tortured our populace
 then 
blamed the communists
Your lies are too obvious, propaganda monotonous
And that's not socialist mythology
This is urban warfare through the streets of your psychology
So I'm like the legs of a paraplegic really
Cause I'm still part of you even if you can't feel me
You can never debate me, The M4s at your baby
Like troops with gats in Iraq do daily
So you can marginalize the way you portray me
But don't get Hollywood and try to play me
We can shoot it out in the theater like troops in the 80s
New Jack City classic crack era
, mack-milli
Shouting BET is not black-owned on Rap City
You got a contract to kill me motherfucker, that's fine
Cause there's a contract to kill your family when I die
So when your car explodes, don't be surprised
Soldier, I'm like Marine Corp C4
Even blow the spot with the beat rocking at 3/4
Canvas the flow like the ghost of Michelangelo
This is the anthem, Immortal Technique and 
Green Lantern
Don't say shit bitch, you don't want the "check, check"
To become a ::chick, chick:
: 
You know what I'm sick with
Lyrical tuberculosis, cocaine overdoses
Blood coming out your noses, that's when death approaches
March to my death smiling, laugh if the end's violent
There's no escape from this political asylum
Revolutionaries don't fear execution
Cause the death of my visible Constitution
Is just the beginning of spiritual evolution
God will reincarnate me as revolution
[DJ Green Lantern]
You can't take out a revolution
You can't kill a idea
Fuck is you stupid?
You kill that man, he becomes Immortal
[Immortal Technique]
Ignore the triplets, this is a fully loaded four-four
3rd World underground hardcore
Street-hop, locked and loaded, motherfucker you should know it
Blast the door to the game open and overthrow it

Yeah... .. yeah - Immortal Technique - Rockin Squat (Rebel Armz)
[Immortal Technique]
I'm handling genetic tampering
Classical sampling -- remix
On the roman empire throughout the land again
Televangeling
Bring the American anthem its selling
Fascism with a democratic packaging
Pontius Pilate I wash my hands of them
Expeditiously
Animal farm - doberman pincher infantry
They need another 9/11 to complete the symphony
Tryna' stop a global revolution that was meant to be
Immortal technique -- I always bring the truth to ya'
With the stage presence of Martin Luther King junior
The sooner the better I'm strapped with a Kevlar sweater
As I await the new Lucius Septimius Severus
Subtle form of the Fourth Reich is how they planned it
Turning food into bio-diesels starving the planet
I free people from the matrix wherever I find them
And cut the industry's dope with a lab-grown diamond
[Rockin' Squat]
Ce monde est fucked-up et tu crois qu'on va se taire
C'est facile de nous faire croire que personne peut rien y faire
Mais la lutte continue, moi je ramène la possibilité
D'ouvrir sa vision universelle et enfin se libérer
[Immortal Technique]
The world is fucked up coz thats the way we made it
And its easy to think that nothin can change it
I paint a picture of a possibility for all of you
Revolutions universal vision is followed through
[Rockin' Squat]
Après les rires viennent les larmes, malgré mes cris d'alarmes
Le pétrole des Afghanes intéresse toujours Carlyle
Donc mon style dénonce la spéculation des actions à Wall Street
La corruption du Tiers-Monde organisée à Maastricht
Vite, je sors mon juice d'artiste
Prends les devants rentre sur la piste
Au milieu du 666
Moi je remonte jusquà l'Égypte pour analyser le fasciste
On ne se perd pas dans leur Histoire car leur Histoire est hors piste
St Patrick cest ..., Mac Donald cest ...,
Machintoch cest ..., IBM cest Danger Zone
Grande-Bretagne cest Satanisme, Amérique cest Amaru Ka
La sagesse de la Terre, un jour tu comprendras
En direct des favelas d'America Latina
La révolution n'est pas qu'un peura qu'on kique pour soi, négro
Le relais de l'info, la vraie, pas comme Fox News
Putain de texte deep, j'aurais du faire du blues
Chorus
[Immortal Technique & Rockin' Squat]
Yeah...Immortal Technique...Rockin' Squat....Freedom...Peru, Brazil, HARLEM, NEW YORK !, Paris, to the streets motherfucker! 3rd World, for the world.......
Chorus

[Immortal Technique]
Oh, you mother fuckers thought it was over, huh
Well its not, you didn't count on a fallen angel
Getting back into the grace of God and coming after you
Ya'll niggas ain't shit
Your producers ain't shit
Your fucking A & R ain't shit
I'll fucking wipe my ass with your demo deal
Yo Diabolic, take this mother fucker's head off
[Diabolic]
Go ahead and grip Glocks
I'll snap your trigger finger in six spots
You'll have to lip lock with hypodermic needles to lick shots
I'll watch you topple flat
Put away your rings and holla back
Can't freestyle,
 
you're screwed off the top like bottle caps
Beneath the surface, I'm over heating your receiving circuits
By unleashing deeper verses than priests speak in churches
What you preach is worthless
Your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush taking bullets for the Secret Service
Beyond what ya'll fathom
I shit on cats and jaw tap 'em
Show no com-passion like having a straight faced orgasm
Tour jack 'em
, 
have his half a ten bitch suck my friend's dick
In the mean time, you can French kiss this clenched fist
Diabolic, a one man brigade spreading cancer plague
Fist-fucking a pussy's face, holding a hand grenade
So if I catch you bluffin'
Faggot, you're less than nothing
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction
[Technique]
You mother fuckers are nothing
You cannot harm me
I'll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
Storm the planet hunting you down cuz I'm on a mission
To split your body into a billion one-celled organisms
Immortal Technique will destroy your religion you stupid bitch
You're faker than
 
blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
I'm about to blow up like NASA Challenger computer chips
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I'm like time itself, I'm gunna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you,
 
fuck using a chrome piece
I'm Illmatic
, 
you won't make it home like Jerome's niece
I'll sever your head diagonally for thinking of dissin' me
And then ill use your dead body to write my name in
 
calligraphy
This puppet democracy, brain washed your psychology
So you're nothing like diversity without equality
And your crew is full of
 
more faggots than Greek mythology
Using numerology, to count the people I sent to Heaven
Produces more digits than 22 divided by 7
You're like Kevin Spacey, your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you not a mother fucking thug yet
Your mind is empty and spacious
Like the part of the brain that appreciates culture in a racist
Face it, you're too basic, you're never gonna make it
Like children walking through Antarctica, butt naked

[Intro]
Yo, in a hundred years from now
Everyone who's living on this planet will be dead
So it's inconsequential really
All the shit that you talk
All the bullshit that you stand for
It's more important what, what you're ready to build
What you're ready to pass down to your children
What you're ready to create
You better fucking remember that
When you challenge a motherfucker like me
Remember, I'm the dominant species
[Verse 1]
I'm stuck inside the future and life is chaotic
The government is psychotically racist and robotic
The matrix of entrapment is socio-economic
Neurotic conspiracy theory becomes reality
Life is war, and every day's a battle to me
I'm on the brink of insanity, between extreme intelligence and split personalities
But I elevate to the point of reversing gravity
Revolutionary conceptuality spitting out of me
Even the dead people in my family tell me they proud of me
Stupidity's not allowed by me,
 
cause I don't got time to play
I'm the black hole lyricist that'll take your shine away
Darkness at any time of day
I'm the Technique and you're nobody, so what you trying to say?
Stellar density becomes your physical alignment
1.8 billion tons per square inch confinement
[Hook]
Yo, yo, yo, 
I drop knowledge so heavy it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrical apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet
[Verse 2]
Yo, yo, lyrically I'm infinite like possibilities
But you don't have the capability like infertility
Cause opening your mouth to question my validity
Is like trying to contradict the theory of relativity
What I spit is the epitome of heavy artillery
My enemies are obsessed with me like the bitch in Misery
But break out like father running
 
from
 responsibility
Every time I step and abuse the mic with versatility
I balance humility, with brutal instinct
I'll make your whole cypher look like those crackers from N'Sync
And I don't care about your link, or your luxury car
I shed light with more magnitude than all of the stars
La Brea Tar Pit thick,
 so don't ever talk shit
And remember something nigga, while you rave and rant
A roach can live for nine days without its head, but you can't
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I'm explicit like video tapes of conjugal visits
Some niggas are too stupid to understand it like astrophysics
Technique is exquisite
I'll make your thoughts a victory
Get pessimistic with the quickness
If you think that I will just become another statistic with anything but success
When I bless the mic as I spit this
Specifically prolific with Kaprosi’s sarcoma coma type sickness
My style is like a ten year old child with a slit wrist, too much reality
For the fucking hit list
I got a Black Panther mentality with a spic fist
So you can get dissed
Even if you're locally gold, vocally bold, or globally
Multi-platinum sold
I'm emotionally cold, disciplined, and ready to kill
Like spirits in the same room with you, I'm giving you chills
I drop knowledge while these mother fuckers clumsily spill
And I drop it so heavy, it leaves the world unbalanced
Exterminate the spiritual force of all that challenge
I'm the lyrically apocalypse that crumbles the granite
Replacing you as the dominant species on the planet

[Hook: Mojo of Dujeous]
I am the eye in the sky
Looking at you
I can read your mind
I am the maker of rules
Dealing with fools
I can cheat you blind
[Verse: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, my truth is the 
ark of the covenant
 buried in Ethiopia
Watch who you fucking with in Minneapolis: Somalian
When I go home the world I use to know is gone
And I will live on my own
For what shall it prosper the rapper with creative control
To sign a deal with the devil and lose his soul
My still born first expression is cold
Like the faces of slave masters on the paper I fold
Subliminal racial supremacy choking me quick
Like the bedtime stories of Joseph Smith
Lynch mob gunning for me trying to murder my seeds
So shorty put 'em in the Nile in a basket of reeds
And now I stare in to the future with a spiritual flashlight
Wondering who the fuck was me in a past-life
Bad diet, fuck raw, die young, fast life
Same as a crash flight that took off when the music died on your last night
Tell 'em the truth and they call you a traitor
Talk to 'em honestly and they call you a hater
Losing my composure cause the message is urgent
Talking reckless drunk on the mic like Larry Merchant
Cursing at the serpent Sumerian demons
Who brush their wings against the air that I'm breathing
A heathen with nothing left to believe in
Even a reason from living that was forgiven by God and not religion
Envision Jesus risen from the dead like Horus
In the baptist church shaking off the rigor mortis
The borders should be illegal instead of the people
That were here before the Bible and all of its sequels
I speak to the detached and unrealistic
That were born normal but turned socially autistic
We resisted homeland securities mission
Because I know what they really envisioned...
[Hook x2]

[Paris]
Take it back to the days when we raised us up
'Fore coward-ass rap made the game corrupt
P-Dog in the cut back to bring the pain
Puttin wood on they ass can't stand the rain
And bring heat over beats, and scratch the itch
In a "No Spin Zone," fuck a scanadalous bitch
It's the return of the +Bush Killa+ back to bust
Just us for the justice, in God we trust
I rush truth to the youth, and shine the light
Take the red pill, open up your eyes to life
In this land of these crack fiends sheep and moles
See us overthrow the hold of the devil control
And roll deep, keep it underground for the streets
I'm the last sayin, get 'em outta bounds, retreat
Like ants in this war dance, if one fall
Ten more's in his place to advance the cause, it's all

Chorus
Dem' shoot at us
Turn around and deny it
People on the streets are dying
We must come together
Fight depression and pull de pressure
On de system that tries to diss us
Tries to hurt us, and tries to kill us
We don't win, we fight again
We gon' fight until the end, until the end
We fight until we win, until we win
Sabac
Unjustified shootings, fatal chokins, severe beatins
Police attack the innocent without fair reason
Precincts are full of cowards abusin authority
Minorities abuse majority, people livin in poverty
Priority, is them doing right by the nation
But large parts of it's been human rights violation
Tired of being patient waitin for internal affairs
To show. Improve this, the truth is, we've been burnin for years
Use your weapons, fight back kid, that's how the game goes
My boy Kevin got his skull cracked by pigs in plain clothes
They told him there's agress, if he doesn't stay calm
And proceeded to put cigarettes out in his palm
Now he can't think, he can't feel
Sometimes you gotta grab steel, blast, peal
Before they sentence you and serve your last meal
I know fightin back is easier said then actin
Let's start movin forward and stop steppin backwards
Chorus
Immortal Technique
On the day, me and Sabac Red
Drop dead, knocked by the feds
Or get shot with a Glock in the head
Like the.. bloods on the corner, the block'll be red
And like the passion of Christ, there'll be alot to be said
Fuck a protest in the street wit all of my peeps
My soul will never let a crooked cops family sleep
And you'll never find peace, even them retired men
Like I'mma do to all yo cops that turned into firemen
I'll keep your children lyin in a sleepin hypnosis
Nightmares about drownin in the ocean erosions
Molested by dead bodies full of worms and locousts
But the insects are nothing when the judgement approaches
Call my spirit the coldest, you say that I'm bitter
But I'm sick of cops callin me a spic and nigga
And you pigs probably won't get the message I write you
Cuz the industry is racist, mother fuckers just like you
Chorus
Sabac
Not everyone is built for war when it comes to cops and
Fear plays a part so I'll inform you of your options
Get the names and badges of cops from the precinct
Show your face in the street so police know you decent
Keep them on their toes take flicks and videos
Impose injustices cuz them clips can be gold
Hold a coalition in your buildin, a new movement
Raise cash, start a civilian review unit
Be aware of wrong doings, inform your whole alliance
Write the senator to put a end to the cold and silence
Let's unite fight back know our rights watch the government
Apply better laws and enforce harsher punishment
For pigs who beat kids for no apparent reason
We acted on the defense while battlin the precinct
If the system won't respond to your truth and facts
Bear arms, they've been warned, retaliate and shoot back
Chorus

[Verse 1: Big lil thug]
Klöppum saman lófunum og snúum bökum saman
Því í dag er sumarsól og gaman
Borðum saman grautinn
Því engin er þrautin
[Verse 2: lil Big thug]
Ég er safi
Bráðum verð ég á kafi
Ég er með þinni mömmu
Og nauðga þinni ömmu
[Verse 3: Big lil thug]
Springandi í augun þín
Læðan er svo sæt og fín
Stúlkan var þæginleg
Ódýr og hversdagsleg
[Verse 4: lil Big thug]
Tindur orti vísur
Meðan ég elskaði skvísur
Oddur átti skó
Sem ég hjó
[Verse 5: Big lil thug]
Hjól ég átti en ég dó
En mér er alveg sama, só
Ég hitti guð og hló
Safnaði saman bitch og ho
[Verse 6: lil Big thug]
Benjamín átti nigga
En Krissi átti Sigga
Uggison pulled da trigga
Tindur got shot, that jigga
[Verse 7: lil Big thug]
Blabiddiblablabla
Ég les dagblað
Moðerfokker, ég er laufblað
Sama ríma, hverjum er ekki drullu sama
Ég þig lama, lama
[Verse 8: Big lil thug]
Ég fór út í búð
Og keypti mér snúð
Síðan leigði ég mér trúð
Og var ógeðslega smooth
Tíkin var heví prúð
[Verse 9: lil Big thug]
Leiðin var löng og ströng
Nú er ég frægari en langatöng
Þetta er það sem ég söng
Leggöng
[Verse 10: Big lil thug]
Löggan já fokk hún
Þar er engin brún
Ég stefni á tunglið, moon
Og verð kominn þar soon
[Message: lil Big thug]
Bitch, suck my diiiiiick
[Verse 11: Big lil thug]
Tindur hélt hann væri cool
Frétti að hann væri fool
Bitch nigga go back to school
[Message 2: Big lil thug]
Mutha muthafucka ooooo

Freedom of speech, motherfucker
Okay, something for the kids (hahaha)
(Pinocchio)
I got no strings to hold be down
To make me fret or make me frown
I had strings, but now I'm free
I got no strings on me
[Verse 1]
Step into the club smoothly with a L in my hand
Bitches know that I'm a freak like the elephant man
Intelligent plans
Fuck a record deal
, 
I want development land
With my benevolent clan
And that's the reason that I only trust my fam
40,000 records sold, 400 grand
Fuck a middle man, I won't pay anyone else
I'll bootleg it and sell it to the streets my self
I'd rather be that than signed and stuck on a shelf
And because of this executives try to diss me
Racism frozen in time like Walt Disney
And now they say they wanna get me signed to the majors
If I switch up my politics and change my behavior
Try to tell me what to rhyme about over the beat
Bitch niggas that never spent a day in the street
But I repeat that nobody can hold my reigns
I put the truth on tracks nigga, simple and plain
(Pinocchio)
I got no strings, so I have fun
I'm not tied up when we need one
They've got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me!
[Verse 2]
I guess to America I'm a disaster
A slave that was destined to own his masters
Independent in every single sense of the word
I say what I want, you fuckin little sensitive herb
This is America, I thought we had freedom of speech
But now you want try to control the way that I speak
And 
O'Reilly
 
you think that you a patriot?
You ain't nothing but a motherfucking racist bitch
Fulla hatred, pressing a button trying to eject me
But I ain't got no motherfuckin deal with Pepsi
No corporate sponsor telling me what to do
Asking me to tone it down during the interview
Tryin' to minimize the issue, but I'm keeping it large
I love the place that I live, but I hate the people in charge
Speakin is hard when you got strings attached
So I'm a say it for you cause I ain't got none o' that
And if you didn't understand what I spit at your brain
Aiyyo son, let this little nigga explain:
(Pinocchio)
I got no strings so I have fun
I’m not tied up to anyone
They’ve got strings but you can see
There are no strings on me
Come on son, y'all niggas know the way I do
Immortal Technique, dot com live for you
And I know sometimes it be making you nervous
The way I snatch puppet rappers that belong in a circus
You motherfuckers just can't compare
Looking for a fan base that's no longer there
I know that you're scared, and you're hidin' up in the cut
But this is freedom of speech nigga, tell 'em what's up
Word nigga, fuck John Ashcroft! Nigga, fuck Fox News! Fuck those snake-ass
Bitches Tryin to manipulate your opinion, tellin you what to think
Word the fuck up, like "we invaded niggas cause we want to free them"
You racist motha fucka, you don't give a shit about those people
You can suck my dick!!
(hahahaha)
Another rum and coke at the bar, nigga
Its my day off, word up
Fuck, for the kids, (ha) for the kids (hahaha)
Beat Bandits

[Verse 1: Diabolic]
I two-step with Lucifer and ever since I started dancin’
I’ve walked a fine line between Einstein and Charles Manson
Starving in this famine with my stomach growling
Like someone shouting, a hundred thousand times louder than thunder pounding
Fuck around and I’ll punch you’re mouth in
I’m king of the mountain with my life in this project like it's public housing
Countin' on the fact I firebomb entire songs
And won’t stop until the worlds inside my palm like Viacom
Diabolic I’ll supply the higher wattage via fiber optic wire
Until you acquire some kinda knowledge
Cause life made me grow wiser than old-timers
Hot-headed like the ghost rider behind a slow driver
Sole survivor flowing lava’s second nature
So don’t test its best to save your breath like respirators
I’ll throw a punch at your ribs that gives your lungs asthma
And has you pouring out your guts faster than Dutch Masters
Drunk bastard past the point of no return
Like Denzel tricking Ethan Hawke into smoking sherm
Judgement overturned held in court like Mordecai
Immortalized when I make statues bleed and portraits cry
I’ll go to war for mine, Rebel Army guard the border
I’m in the trenches barking orders like I’m Sergeant Slaughter
Pray to Jesus H. for mercy and plead your case
Cause on the frontlines you’re dead the second that you see my face
[Hook x2: Immortal Technique and Diabolic]
This is the frontline
This is the dead-zone
Barely alive or in a box is how you head home
This is the frontline
This is the life that I chose
I thought I told you muthafuckas to lock and load
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
They said that the success of my music was theoretic
But my revenge is sweet enough to murder diabetics
Eugenics Procter and Gamble credit racial science
Couldn't produce a more aggressive intellectual giant
Nephilim, bury em' with the bullets left in them
My heart is blacker than the children of Thomas Jefferson
Blacker than back in the days of tar and featherin'
A cancerous endocrine the eagle that's American
The hatchet and the sticks the fascist emblem
You could call it conspiracy theory
I don't give a motherfuck
You could get your mother fucked
National security's a code-word for cover-up
Hold that down I look at character
Never let the color get to ya
I got white Revolutionaries like Muslims in Chechnya
Percussion thumping like the Russian Mafia over ya
But even they know what it's like when you fighting for 
Svoboda
So whether Slavic or Islamic vodka/gin tonic
Drunken fantasies are cool son but here's the grim logic
You niggas wanna play industry and starve to be rich
Until they fuck you for millions like Paul McCartney's bitch
My lions live inside a box like Jumanji
Sikh niggas that'll stab you up like Indira Gandhi
So never desecrate the space on which I meditate
My thoughts rip through tank-armored metalplates
And start to resonate to the spot where Moses caused the sea to separate
The place that the Prophet Muhammad started to levitate
The exact moment that Jesus rose dead awake
And Siddhartha became the Buddha that regenerates
Half a bar over but I bring it home colder than dead soldiers
Soul controller holder of knowledge so fuck Dianetics
I'm like the whole library in Kemet with Annunaki genetics
[Hook]
[Outro: Immortal Technique and Diabolic]
This is the Frontline the people first; one time
Thirty-two and a little somethin' ah ha ha
33-Degrees motherfucka go home and figure it out

[Interlude]
I'm doing this one for America!
I'm tired of all these threats from North Korea saying they gonna nuke us and shit!
Fuck them!
Fuck Kim Jong! He a bitch!
It is America, bitch! You fat bullshit! I don't give a fuck!
[Hook]
Fuck North Korea, I said fuck North Korea (x8)
[Verse]
Fuck North Korea and everything they say
Threatening the USA like every single day
We should vaporize them all today
Nuke the fuck out of them until their skies turn gray
I don't care what you have got to say, this is the USA
[?] for this land will we lay
And I'm tired of the bullshit that Kim Jong has to say
Kim Jong is a bitch, Kim Jong is a ho (x2)
Kim Jong is a bitch, yeah he a ho
I don't give a hoot, I don't give a shit
Imma fucking kill everyone in North Korea
I don't give a shit
I will fight for my rights, I will fight for the shit
I don't give a fuck, Imma fucking my bitch [?] 29 states
Don't threaten the States, this is my land, this is my land, this is my land (x2)
[Hook]
Fuck North Korea, I said fuck North Korea (x8)
[Outro]
Eeeeeeyup
Eeeeeeyup
Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeyup!

Termanology]
Ayo, I try to relax, max chill with my kid
Still cats getting shot in front of my crib
I try to chill, think "man this ain't no way to live"
So I don't trip, I dip but I ain't afraid of shit
Cats get it twisted cause' I don't call it goons
Like I can't have my cousin see your mothers room
I ain't a soft dude, like some assume
I got a gully crew and they got a hundred tools
I been tellin yall cats its a hundred jewels
I'm from the boneyard crews with a hundred dudes
I been paying dues, doing shows and mixtapes, shit
But still my click sprays shit
Lot of cats lookin at me like the clique ain't shit
But we still up in the hood with them radio spins
Do you know what its like for you to have fame
But your life ain't change, not a dollar to your name?
I bang, so I'm back where the stick-up kids rob chains
Where you get shot for a pair of Lebron James
I got them long things, and they all bang
But I ain't tryna turn your night to a long day
You might be the one if I got the right aim
It might be your son if I got the wrong aim
And that's the raw thing, you wanna think about
So you better think it out, before you rob the wrong chain
[King Magnetic] (Official verse lyrics)
Rap got me hustling, strappin the gun again
Blast if they comin in, wrath of the government
Laugh til republicans, taxing our publishing
Mask if you bubbling, asking you once again
To pass off the fucking rent - brothers is broke
Never ate with a phony - can't stomach the hoax
Coming too close to death, I ain't tryin to wig
My mixtape's sponsored by Coke, without the fuckin IronPigs
Allentown native surrounded by labor
Haters that neighbor the cradle plus the craver of craters
Invading til we raided or graduating to weighing weight
Debating on waiting or taking garbage until your straight, (thats right)
Hold your breath for me, lay you down on a stretcher seat
When I'm really tryin to vent like a 
s

Until they wrestle me for vesting in that recipe
All I had left was three, so these muthafuckas ain't stressin me
[Immortal Technique]
Break it down...
When you talk revolution niggas take it the wrong way
Think you on some Gandhi shit starving in Bombay
Till you flood their city with heat like it was Pompeii
Have you singing like K-Ci, Jo Jo, and DeVante, (snitch)
Wanna fuck your life up? here’s the recipe nigga;
Try some crystal meth and heroin and ecstasy nigga
Or you could just try fucking ride next to me nigga
Bullet trajectory you’ll hit the ground eventually nigga
Listen, look at your position, is your destiny written?
Is it really free-will that you’re given?
Or a choice from one of gods infinite decisions?
I don’t need any given religion, its state driven
Snake Plissken escape from New York
 to spread the sickness
Unforgiven baron wasteland apocalyptic
I’ve indictably scripted everything futuristic
So now to the fullest extent is how I live shit

[Verse 1]
Yea I turned 21 in prison locked up at night
Now I walk around free seems like another life
Another roll with some other dice
Another ho or a loving wife
People come and go some really you never know
Intellectual midgets that really never grow
Fake love that holds on like "can I hold you though?"
And old friends will look at you like "yo, yea, I told you so"
A toast to the broken hearted
Who never finished what they fuckin started
People who go out and try to be a rebel at night
Try to make up for the fact that they settled in life
It's like a fight between the devil & Christ over the limelight
Spiritual celebrity poker
But the whole deck is full of jokers
And every year that you get older
The stakes get higher
Gambling with a bunch of fakes and liars
Real talk cause the real New York
Is the pain and the suffering of lost love
Staring off into the distance in the midst of the club
Depression and emptiness that lead to suicide
And the struggle inside of yourself that keeps you alive
Survived and medicated stalked by sobriety
The life that you live now tortured by memories violently
I pray inside of me that one day you could be forgiven
For murdering the beautiful world we used to live in
[Hook x2]
Crimes of the heart
[Verse 2]
Love, doesn't need a complicated metaphor
And sometimes nothin' needs to be said at all
Sometimes a person you're with is not your one and only
And you just fuck with them because you afraid to be lonely
And when you come back its too late
So you overcompensate
, 
like victims of rape, full of self-hate
Lost in the affection to strangers around you
Instead of the only person that ever gave a fuck about you
Thought you were happy so you didn't come check me
But then when he cheated or treated you incorrectly
You conveniently realized you could never forget me
And tried to crawl back in my life unexpectedly
These are my indictments of those who claim to be righteous
And leave a trail of broken hearts on their way to enlightment
But I can't give into hatred or pass judgment
Even towards every illusion I've been in love with
Cause the heart that betrays itself willingly
Is like a nation that trades freedom for stability
It's so seductive to be cold and corrupted
And isolated and try to be an independent republic
But liberty to be loved on the surface is worthless
The sacrifice of revolution with no purpose
Take it from a criminal searching for his redemption
Cursing at God desperately trying to get his attention
[Hook x2]
[Bridge]
Looking for the shining light
Who's it gonna be
Who'll walk the line with me tonight
Round we go, won't cross
Climbing through the endless night
Who's it gonna be
Who'll walk the line with me this time
Climbing through the endless night
[Hook]

I won't rhyme about puttin a hole in your in dome
I get Israeli on you I put a hole in your home...
Holdin a chrome
 
rocket propelled grenade launcher
I get paid to murder motherfuckers like the Contras..."
Weapon scandal I handle The gamble of making examples
Hannibal Elephant trample mandible samples
Curve serving on you little bastard niggas
It’s not a movement if you don’t own your masters nigga
You asked me here to spit a feestyle but here's the difference
A freestyle is some shit that was never in existence
Like the shit im kicking now, the shit with the know how
The shit 
that Im proud e yo
Immortal Technique the last Mahican on the warpath kid
Should've gone to jail forever for the crimes that I did
But im chillin like a frigidaire
, I never care
Immortal Technique the freesyle of the mental
Immortal Technique I don't recognize this instrumental
But I guess you made it up just a moment ago
Im rocking it slow or am I rocking it fast?
Immortal Technique I was never late for class
I just didn't show up,
 
fuck it Immortal Technique Rolling tracks
Immortal Technique I said my name too many times
But thats what happens when you spittin freestyle rhymes
And you just say the first thing that comes to your head
Like I like some cheeseburger with a little nice bread
Fuck it I ryhme about whatever im kinda hungry
Immortal Technique My pockets full of money
And some of y'all ain't and if you mad at me than fuck you nigga
And I can still freestyle and that didn't rhyme it's just offensive
And it just get's relentless, Immortal Technique not repeditive but
Except when I say my name not a sedative
It gets you lived up it gets you crazy it gets you hyped
It gets you ready to fuck your girl tonight
That means im responsible for your baby being born
Im responsible for a lot of shit
You can call me a terrorist cuz I attack in response
Immortal Technique yeah I drop bombs, and thats what happens
Immortal Technique never been platinium, guess I said my name so many times
But thats so you can remember it, so many rhymes that I spit
And thats the way we market shit, it's ingrained in your mind
Like them commercials you hate Immortal Technique im still making this paid
And then
I now you gonna hate this shit when you play it back cuz your be like damn how
Many time he said his name on a track, fuck it a said again
Immortal Technique, fuck you, that's the end!

[Immortal Technique]
My rhymes are harder to digest for money
Than coke balloons in a Colombian broad's tummy
You fucking dummy, I'm like a fucking firing squad
You get a empty feeling like you lying to God
Lucifer status
, you goin' crazy like crack addicts
Acid tabs, mad hatters and talking jack rabbits
Pack an automatic, you don't know me money
I'll smack the shit out you like you owe me money
Immortal Technique, body strapped up with plastique
Leave a crater like a meteor landed in the street
My presence, еven backed with an essence stays hard
Like fucking on a Native American graveyard
My peoples spirit still stands defiant
Until American falls and they stand in triumph
Lyrical Nephilim giant, Look me up in the bible
The son of the son, Genesis 6
Homicidal

[Intro]
Lamentablemente, las condiciones que estamos viviendo en
Han llegado a se runa miseria insoportable para la gente
Pero hay unas veinte patrias engreidas que todavía creen
En una sociedad de antes donde los artistas
Fuimos bestias de trabajo para la industria
Ese sueño se ha acabado
Y ahora nos encontramos despiertos en la hora de revolución
Porque no podemos llamar esto un 'movimiento' si toda la propiedad
Intelectual pertenece a los que nos oprimen
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Motherfucker!
Ya te dije
Que se ha acabado la mierda
[Immortal Technique]
Nos compraron el alma barata
Hasta la sangre nos sacan, atacan
Y con un contrato te atrapan
Pero primero me matan hermano
Porque prefiero morir
Peleando que ser esclavo
Industria sucia
Toma lluvia de acido
Aprende la historia del hip hop clásico
Cuando controlan el negocio y la cultura
La música se vuelve en comercial basura
Y la reina latina, pintada como gallina
Es mas que bailarina o puta en la esquina
Es abogada, profesora, madre, soldada
Y carga nuestro futuro cuando está embarazada
Mira nuestra gente crucificada
Y la manera desgraciada
Que estos perros no hablan de nada
Más que fiestas y riqueza
Que la gente no tiene
Asi que ahora vas a ver
La violencia que viene
[Coro]
Un movimiento de verdad ha empezado
Dejamos el imperio corrupto descuartizado
Golpe de estado disparando al presidente
Es hora de revolución nuevamente
Un movimiento de la gente se a juntado
Peleando, liberando los pueblos encarcelados
Golpe de estado y seramos independiente
Es hora de revolución nuevamente
[Veneno]
Dale, llega llega el español sin bacteria
This ain't that "mueve la cadera" it's that "usa tu cabeza"
Tu mente, tu almendra, No pa que baile, pa que aprenda
Esta industria me da pena
Same shit, 
misma mierda
El mismo de siempre yo no me muerdo la lengua
Tu camina por el barrio
 y rincón de la prenda
Vive la prensa
Veneno el guerrillero ya llego
Con el inmortal
, dicha, 
el gobierno se asusto
FBI, CIA, gotta pay to get played
Out here in the United States, 
no me interesa ser el Rey
La voz de los Latinos
 camino sin correr
So wassup
Que es lo que el compromiso al te Veneno
Fuego, 
al firmar te dicen como tirar tu flow
.................
En Golpe de Estado la industria la infiltramos
..
[Coro]
[Temperamento]
Golpe de estado el mercado me tiene bravo
Hermano yo pinto el cuadro
Y el barrio ya esta cansado cabrón
Yo te lo juro que lo que yo sudo es puro
Ustedes son burros
Que venden el culo por el reggaetón
Abre los ojos, cojo el presidente del sello
Bobo le rompo el cuello al pendejo
Solo con mi cañón
Yo soy la epidemia, la saga, las nueve plagas
La misma palabra en la biblia
Que habla de Armagedón
Levanta publico mano te tienen imnotisado
Entrenado inyectandote mierda con la estación
Perriando quiere decirte que tu eres de la brutas
No te gusta que te llamen puta escucha la canción
El sandunguero es tan feo
Que es con doble sentido
Le dicen a tu hijo que lo haga sin condón
El es Tempera y el capitan Immortal
Vamos a gritas pa que viva la revolución
((the following lyrics are not from this song and I'm unable to remove them))
No tengo miedo guerrero por eso muero
Y me quedo con tiraera
Porque ella llama la atencion
Temperamento rey del movimiento
Este es mi tiempo
Con mi cancion
Hasta Tempo sale de la prision
Por mis palabras tengo seguidores
Rapeadores en todas las naciones
Comisiones de aplicar presion
La competencia es riqueza
Que tristeza
Que tengo que romperle la cabeza
Pa que me pidan perdon

[Intro 1]
And it's not smart to be dumb
It's not smart to be dumb bumb de dumb dumb dumb
Back where I come from it's not considered smart to be dumb
[Intro 2]
[Immortal Technique]
Okay little empanada, time for bed
[
Empanada
]
Uncle Felipe
[Immortal Technique]
What, what is it now?
[Empanada]
I heard that you and my dad used to be in a gang. Is that true?
[Immortal Technique]
Who told you that man, your mother? It wasn't a gang, we were just a group of friends
[Empanada]
Did you do bad things?
[Immortal Technique]
No no no look we just used
 
to draw on stuff
 
and
 
play karate
, 
borrow things
, 
throw stuff
, 
y'know run around at night. Like Goonies
[Empanada]
What's a Goonie?
[Immortal Technique]
You never heard of Goonies before?
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I coulda chose another life with the feds try'na get me
Little kids putting work in like at Gap and Disney
In the whip, high as shit like
 
Bobby and Whitney
Grab your hand and push the motherfuckin' pedal to sixty
Harlem cops frisk me to get me to make their quotas
But I told ya "
Siempre hay que separar las drogas
"
Bar brawl in the club popping and rocking jaws
Shot it out leaving bullet holes the size of Matzah balls
I love thick chicks, never fucked with a slim broad
Played soccer and hammered nails into their shin guards
Gambled at
 
cee lo
 
with Dominicans
 
locked in the tombs
We was there for robbing niggas for them Spanish doubloons
Remember Goonie-era graffiti of all sorts
Now they wanna foreclose on the hood to build a golf course
I'll put your hand in a blender to make an entree
Then cut your dick off and glue it back on the wrong way
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
All my revolutionary soldiers better ride
My word is mathematics bitch, numbers never lie
So even if they tell you I'm dead, I'm still alive
Because, motherfucker, Goonies never die
Witness protection program, rappers better hide
I serve revenge out the freezer niggas never slide
So if they tell you I'm gone and you safe, niggas lied
Because, motherfucker, Goonies never die
[Verse 2: Swave Sevah]
I'm a certified Goonie,
 
the type to burglarize your crib
And leave it smellin' like
 
sour and Afghan gooey
Life is a movie but
 
yours was filmed on a greener screen
I give you pure uncut raw, no deleted scenes
War with a broadsword dumping a tech nine
Slit your throat give you a Colombian neck tie
The best buy to get we let die, let fly the next guy to try some shit
Listen, a few words just to describe my clique
We like a gang of Spartans, walking on the Gaza Strip
Never say die
 
it's time to fight and we never run
My Goonies rob niggas for jewelry, we call 'em treasure hunts
Let him front like he a tough guy with me
I'll hit em slug turn him to One-Eyed Willy, watery grave hide ya chips
I'll hijack ya boat load and cruise away on my pirate ship
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
[Verse 3: Diabolic]
Before Duncan Pinderhughes was runnin' with Doug E. Doug
My team got away with murder, we ain't fit the bloody glove
Those jungle breeds and we come to feed our hungry cubs
With hoes pulling out our pipes like Goonies under country clubs
Let these 
funny thugs
 know whoever steps in 
'Bolics
 spot
Is getting crushed with solid rock like Chester Copperpot
I suggest the drama stops 
I'll flood blocks with mustard gas
You're up shits creek in a rubber raft cut in half
Cross my fucking path I'll dare you I'll mangle who lit the fuse
Quick to lose my marbles like Mikey replacing his with jewels
Watching y'all enslave the game I'm forced to say the truth
Break the chains quick as Sloth reaching for a Baby Ruth
We got 80 proof and whores in daisy dukes extra low
While fat bitches do the truffle shuffle just to get in shows
Fuck what your record sold
 
respect the code and recognize
The rebel tribe that my people kept alive will never die
[Hook: Immortal Technique]
[Outro]

[Pumpkinhead]
Praise to the most high for blessin me with a seed
Now I gotta make it to the top with speed, like Keanu Reeves
And when I bleed, I feed a million children indeed
With the knowledge and the strength that they need
Fuck the military! Man beg my pardon
The only thing my dad got from them was Agent Orange
Cocksuckers experimented, on they own soldiers
I'd rather be in a coma than help fill in they quota
Give me a bulldozer, and before the world is over
I'll find Bush and his daddy and run both they asses over
The Bush's are trigger happy and wanna be in a war
Two people they're like raisin the taxes and killin the poor
I say I put the sword to they jaw, let it off
'Til they jaw fall to the floor, and Colin Powell callin the morgue
You call him a hero but I call him a whore
Gettin pimped by the system that wanna see the end of us all
[Hook]
It goes one grenade, two grenade, three grenade, four
Pull the pin let it go it'll be the death of us all
I'll be a motherfuckin martyr before a soldier at war
Fuck the law, we gon' settle the score
[Pumpkinhead]
One grenade, two grenade, three grenade, four
Pull the pin let it go, it'll be the end of us all
I'll be a motherfuckin martyr before a soldier at war
Fightin my brothers and sisters overseas for your laws
You stick your nose in everybody country business when yours
Is the most corrupt nation, illumination blinding us all
You don't think they already got UFO's in store?
With technology to travel lightspeed past ours?
I guarantee, these 
lizard reptilian figures
Hidin under human flesh under they breath callin us niggas
I pull the motherfuckin trigger, explode your liver for fun
And I won't stop 'til daddy and junior's kissin my gun
Slugs pop from a short distance, listen you're done
Your existance short-lived, now you live on the sun
Burnin for eternity, your skin lift off your bones
Now your skin is black like mine with a crispier tone
[Hook]
[Outro: Immortal Technique]
Yeah, you see my black and latino people
There are some truths that we have to face
And there are some lies we have to uncover
And there are some fake muh'fuckers out there talkin
And they talkin for us, but they not talkin to us
And they not talkin about us
They just speakin, as if it was from our perspective

[Intro]
Let me welcome both of you to the show this morning to talk
About what I consider a very, very important topic of the 
Harlem Renaissance
But before we get into that
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Harlem once was red line district rated
Designated ghetto like the yellow star of David
And you wonder why people don't own their homes
Cause the racist bank wouldn’t fucking mortgage a loan
Until after the invasion of gentrification
Eminent domain intimidation
That's not negotiation, and it's frustrating to look at
Every day, 
like watching a porno, on 56k
Biohazard labs instead of storerooms
Whats next motherfucker, projects as dorm rooms
You ain't fooling nobody in this community duke
With your little fake Manhattanville community group
Ivy League
, 
real estate firms are corrupt
They lay siege to your castle like the Moors in Europe
They treat street vendors like criminal riffraff
While politicians get the corporate kickback
[Refrain]
Harlem Renaissance, a revolution betrayed
Modern day slaves, thinkin' that the ghetto is saved
Till they start deporting people off the property
Ethnically cleansing the hood, economically
They wanna kill the real Harlem Renaissance
Tryna put the Virgin Mary through an early menopause
The savior is a metaphor for how we set it off
Guerrilla war against the rezoning predators
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
When I speak about Harlem I speak to the world
The little Afghan boy and the Bosnian girl
The African of Sudan
, 
the people of Kurdistan
The third world American, indigenous man
Palestinians
, 
Washington Heights
 
Dominicans
Displaced New Orleans citizens
Beach front Brazilian favelas that you livin' in
The hood is prime real estate, they want back in again
I didn't write this to talk shit
, I say it because
Some of ya'll forgot what the Harlem Renaissance was
We had revolution, music, and artisans
But 
the movement was still fucked up like Parkinson's
Cause while we were giving birth to the culture we love
Prejudice kept our own people outta the club
Only colored celebrities in the party
And left us a legacy of false superiority
W.E.B. Du Bois
 
versus
 
Marcus Garvey
And we ended up, selling out to everybody
The 
Dutch Schultz
 and 
John Gotti's
Banksters, modern day gangsters
Immobile army
They wanna move us all out the NYC
Like they did to the Jews
With the Alhambra Decree
So support your own businesses and do the knowledge
Cause the real Harlem Renaissance is economic
[Refrain]
[Outro]
When they were saying it is the renaissance of Harlem
They didn't mean that we had stake in that
They meant to say that they could make money out of us
They are coming in with all kinds of prejudices
In 
Brooklyn
 they're doing the same thing
In 
Queens
 they're doing the same thing
The Bronx
, there's hardly any place which is affordable
I mean those people are putting up condominiums which start from a million dollars
How many people in this community make that kind of money
How many people HAVE that kind of money
People of Harlem, they are the natural allies of the oppressed people of the world
Whether the struggle is in Panama, in Africa, Cuba
We spend money with the wrong people
We are looking for love with people
Who don't love us
What's wrong with loving each other and making sure we are protected

[Verse 1]
Yeah.... 
Harlem streets stay flooded in white powder
Like those mother fuckers runnin' away from the twin towers
Gun shots rock the Earth like a meteor shower
Bowling For Columbine, fear giving the media power
Innocence devoured like a chicken spot snack box
Government cocaine cooked into ghetto crack rock
Corrupt cops false testimony at your arraignment
Check to check, constant struggle to make the payments
Working your whole life wondering where the day went
The subway stays packed like a multi-cultural slave ship
It's rush hour, 2:30 to 8, non stoppin'
And people coming home after corporate share croppin
And fuck flossin, mothers are trying to feed children
But gentrification is kicking them out of their building
A generation of babies born without health care
Families homeless, thrown the fuck off of the welfare
[Hook x4]
Homicide Harlem, BLAOW!, what's the problem?
[Verse 2]
It's like Cambodia, "The Killing Fields" uptown
We live in distress and hang the flag upside down
The sound of conservative politicians on television
People in the hood are blind so they tell us to listen
They vote for us to go to war instantly
But none of their kids serve in the infantry
The odds are stacked against us like a casino
Think about it, most of the army is Black and Latino
And if you can't acknowledge the reality of my words
You just another stupid mother fucker out on the curb
Trying to escape from the ghetto with your ignorant ways
But you can't read history at an illiterate stage
And you can't raise a family on minimum wage
Why the fuck you think most of us are locked in a cage
I give niggas the truth, cause their pride is indigent
You better off rich and guilty than poor and innocent
But I'm sick of feeling impotent watching the world burn
In the era of apocalypse waiting my turn
I'm a Harlem nigga that's concerned with the future
And if you're in my way it'd be an honor to shoot ya
Up root ya with the evil that grows in my people
Making them deceitful, cannibalistic and lethal
But I see through the mentality implanted in us
And I educate my fam about who we should trust
[Hook]

[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Far on the moon and dreaming of conquering planets
But having to overcome human basic behavior to savage
Average apathy eclipses actual tragedy
And the fact that it detracts from peoples’ moral capacity
History cooked up and cut up like Mac and cheese
You selectively removed like the book of Maccabees
Genetically altered athlete digital salary
Economic paper collapse equal internet magazine
Dazzling rebirth of the Nazarene
Crucified by Neo-con Romanized drag queen
Year of the 4th president, grandchildren inheritor
Religiously splinted urban warfare America
Naturally moving, the birth of a new human
That selects to reject, technology’s illusion
Starting a shift in the outlook for a 22G
The planet is earth, the year is 8000 BC

You not as cold as me
Mother fucker, stop pretendin
I'll murder you in front of your crib like John Lennon
Rip the tendons outta your muscle to cut the tension
I'm beyond your comprehension
Like related subatomic particles in fifth dimensions
Suspension in your breathing is what I'm leaving
Until a legion of demons whisper the meaning of life in ya ear
Right before they make ya mother fucking life disappear
But just because you hear the multi-syllabic gramatical
Don't compare me to rappers that are on sabbatical
Cause i never did business in little fucking Italy
I play checkers on triple-decker buses in Tripoli
The way that you typically bicker with me, inexplicably
Is a mystery that pisses me off ridiculously
Because im lyrically beyond your level, scientifically
Specifically, spitting out the spick in me, prolifically
Im the majority of America, futuristically
After i die, fuck my music, you'll feel me spiritually
Darker than Sicily, rippin above the averages
You hold no weight, like bitches after miscarriages
And your label produces no kids like gay marriages
I'm disparaging every fake-thug rapper in sight
That's why your faggot ass will never make it into the light
I'll crack your skull when i smash your face into the mic
And now you know what I'm like
I'll Suge Knight the industry, i feel like the spirit of Nat Turner got into me
You're infinitely hopless, you sound like shit when you spit live, like Jennifer Lopez
I'll massacre a rich rapper, and all his broke friends
And go to club Cheetah, rockin some blood-soaked Timbs
Party-crashin animal, fuckin model bitches
Leavin their stick-figure anorexic pussy in stitches
My verbal blitz is to outshine your offense
You're watered-down nonsense, and I'm 200-proof
Chockin a local youth in his home-made vocal booth
You're a fucking incompetent killer like Rae Carruth
And I'm Technique, the rawest nigga ever produced
I spit nastier than regurgitating period juice
So burn your fucking rhymebook, stay warm, and put it to good use
Im bout to drop like frozen airplane shit through ya roof
And im sick of fake hustlers telling lies to the youth
You never robbed Dominicans, and you couldn't sling rocks if you was Palestinian
You broke mother fucker, you cats don't burn rubber
You niggas can't even get a cab like Danny Glover
You ain't hardcore, ill smack the shit outta your mother
You wanna be gutter? i'll leave you laid out in the street
Signed yours truly, the mother fuckin Immortal Technique
Thanks to ado

[Immortal Technique]
Somebody talked shit to me in L.A. and never lived
Cause brown roll deeper than red or blue ever did
I got bullets that'll rip through your ribs
More painful than watching R. Kelly piss on your kids
Here's the 
ultimatum
 mothafucka
Give me that *ASCAP*
Or give America Biggie and 2Pac flashbacks
Some niggas don't think the Underground is grimy and dirty
'Til they find your body on a fucking highway in Jersey
I fire rockets at generic topics
Your lyrics don't hold weight
Like two-dimensional objects
Cause jail culture didn't give you that fitted hat
To memorize a ghostwritten shit verse and spit it back
I won't let your wack rhymes redefine lyricism
For a whole generation with their fathers in prison
You live inside the image of an Era that's gone
Like government officials trying to justify Vietnam
I'll leave niggas traumatized like they momma died
And they was responsible for the driveby homicide
And I don't market revolution, I live it
What you think cause you fake everyone else is a gimmick
Jealous bickering, industry slaves, the nerve of you
Like a child prostitute born into a life of servitude
Until we murder you making the red carpet burgundy
The Psycho Realm and the streets were I prefer to be
*
Immortal Technique:
Hollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest
Weed clouds in the air that cause turbulence
'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it
I light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it
Hollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas
War with the system like the streets of Oaxaca
Yea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it
Well its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it
[Sick Jacken of Sick Symphonies]
You're on some bullshit tracks I spit them full clip raps
While most of these 'gangsta rappers' are some full fledge rats
The real Gs stay strapped in full combat
What you see in the videos is full on acts
The streets don't believe you homie
Armaggeddon in the rap game is coming and we lead the army
Rock 'Terror Tape' out of your sounds
Got hostages in pink, this is what they call hip hop now
I keep that metro shit out of my whip
Man that dummy rap is thru, making money is about to extinct
You know the radio is trying to kill rap with that shit
The only thing dying is the DJs when the K spit
We'll hit his CEOs and blow up A&Rs
Im taking your chips like crashing your game of cards
This is how I eat holmes I will give you bars
And take the life of these stars for the state of ours
[Immortal Technique]
Hollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest
Weed clouds in the air that cause turbulence
'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it
I light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it
Hollywood Driveby, spraying the
 cucarachas
War with the system like the streets of 
Oaxaca
Yea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it
Well its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it
[Psycho Realm]
Im from the city of fallen stars the home of bangin hard
Waitin for them at the Radio City Hall to snatch em out their fuckin cars
Expose em for what they are: narcs, jakes, snake informants
Feeding us horse shit, blaze up all of them
They say hip hop doesn't exist
Rappers talking hard dressed up like punk rock kids
Pumped up by some corporate endorsement dead corpses are voiceless
No one hears ya homie, ya little fame is over
We'll send little homies for closer like bankers cuz you owe us the mortgage
For exploiting the lifestyle that many died, jailed up for storage
Leaving most of us hopeless homies radio focused
What we're building got em all afraid
Gimme the K I'll be honored to ignite the flame
That'll burn down the game, whats fame? Keep it..
A movement.. a sonic war, motherfucka you sleepin
[Hook]
Hollywood Driveby, motherfucking murderfest
Weed clouds in the air that cause turbulence
'Revolution' motherfucka you heard of it
I light the spliff with the flag while Im burning it
Hollywood Driveby, spraying the cucarachas
War with the system like the streets of Oaxaca
Yea 'Revolution' motherfucka yea you scared of it
Well its coming to the industry now so be prepared for it

Homeland and Hip-Hop
To think about the origins of Hip-Hop in this culture and also about Homeland Security is to see that there are, at the very least,
 
two worlds in America: one of the well-to-do and another of the struggling.
 
For if ever there was the absence of Homeland Security, it is seen in the gritty roots of Hip-Hop.
 
For the music arises from a generation that feels, with some justice, that they have been betrayed by those who came before them, that they are at best tolerated in schools, feared on the streets, and almost inevitably destined for the hell holes of prison. They grew up hungry, hated, and unloved, and this is the psychic fuel that generates the anger that seems endemic in much of the music and poetry. One senses very little hope above the personal goals of wealth to climb above the pit of poverty. In the broader society, the opposite is true, for here, more than any other place on earth, wealth is so wide spread and so bountiful that what passes for the middle class in America could pass for the upper class in most of the rest of the world. They're very opulence and relative wealth makes them insecure and homeland security is a governmental phrase that is as oxymoronic as crazy as saying military intelligence, or the U.S Department of Justice.
 
They're just words, they have very little relationship to reality.
 
Now do you feel safer now? Do you think you will anytime soon? Do you think duct tape and Kleenex and color codes will make you safer?
 
From Death Row this is Mumia Abu-Jamal

They used to call us communists for fighting America
Now they call us terrorists to spread hysteria
Let me just say this, without sounding redundant
Who the fuck really gains the most from blowing up london
And who really made bin laden the man he is
The CIA and saudi arabia did
But that's the past and the future is here
Iraq was a design so for some people the future is clear
A Christmas tree pyramid with a star as an eye
Like the satellite in orbit watching me from the sky
Every country wants a piece of the American pie
But that means you have to co-sign America's lies
So you can criticize human rights in Cuba and China
But not in Israel or the Philippines and places you find them
That are allies of the country I live in
Whose clothes are made by slave labor, women and children
Yeah, I know stupid we're all part of that hypocrisy too
But I don't front like it's democracy dude
I don't pretend troops are peacekeepers who don't murder
And they don't create colonies whose governments serve us
Moving away our economics like we share a techtonic
Plates in your vest are no good, the weapons are sonic
The war on terror evolves like strains of the chronic
From the biologic to the propaganda topics
But remember, the system can never stop when it's been set into motion
Like volcanic eruptions on the floor of the ocean
My purpose is to burst to the surface
Immersed in the smoldering lava from verses
Surrounded by murder mamis, not bitches that's worthless
I cut chicken heads off, like hexes and curses
Weapons I purchased makes homeland security nervous
I run pockets of purses like subway searches
I'm robbing masonic temples disguised as churches
I'm busy, so i'll leave that one for you to interpret
You serpents are merchants of military industry murder
The beef is heating up, like the mad cow in your burger
Fathom the call of cattle cannibalism
Factory farms are like a fucking animal prison
A microcosm of adam smith's capitalism
That's america's real religion, given as the mark of the beast to the christians
The destruction of Babylon motherfucker thats my mission

(Saigon)
When 2Pac comes back the beef is on
, 
W
You wonder why the Black and Latin people don't love ya
Well I'm first, we can start with the church
You're politicizing religion, you and your father's the worst
And um, next: Ya'll took welfare cheques
Give us diseases and then collect health care debts?
(Whatever, what else?)
You only think about yourself
You sendin' niggas to war while your rifle is on the shelf
George, you're something else
Osama, could be 10,000 times worser than you
Find him your fucking self
And why act like you care about the troops in Iraq?
Cause if you did, you would let them fly back
It's because of you that those planes got hijacked
You're also the reason Katrina victims had to die like that
They say you was hesitant, we say you was negligent
It's about time for niggas to
(Chorus)
Impeach the President
Impeach the President
Impeach the President
Impeach the President
(M-1)
How many times do I gotta state my position
Before ya'll say "This lip service, he's wishin'."
I been organizing, I've got a thousand petitions
Been up before sunrise, writing. I'm on a mission
If I could be president, I would lower the rent
And make stic.man my secretary of defense
My whole cabinet would be niggas who ain't havin' it
You think it's fucked up now?
Just watch how bad it gets
(Just Blaze)
Invasion!
I'll push Bush off the White House roof
Calling chickens coming home to roost, it's overdue
Niggas taken advantage of, taken for granted
For the hungry, for the 'hood, for the good of the planet
But not to get it twisted, Bush is only a figurehead
It's bigger yet. The whole system needs to be put to death
If I was president, then I'd get rid of the whole office
Pimp the system out and make the people the  bosses
(Chorus)
(Motherfuckers don't realize how serious this mother fucking shit is.)
(Immortal Technique)
Either stand him, wear the rifle or reach him
Or some bitch give him a blow job so we can impeach him
Teach the motherfucker about the drama I bring
And cut Dick Cheney's hands off for pulling the strings
This is for all my niggas locked in the P
That'll never see the sun until the revolution is bring
George Bush: the puppet king of the planet
Nigga, he don't care about the marriage of faggots
He's got a supreme court full of religious fanatics
Let me break down the mechanics:
Al-Qaeda and America been doin' business well
They're tighter than Interscope and XXL
From the patriot act to rape in Iraq to
Russia's war with Afghanistan
 
taking it back to Texas
Governor, your state is the most polluted
And you had the most niggas executed
Now you're born again
, alcohol and talking to god
Yeah, dog, I read the book your friends wrote
Insert the footnotes about how you used to sniff coke
Frontin' like drug-free role models in harmony
Your family in florida lives in a pharmacy
Corporate larceny, tax cuts, that's how you started
Twelve IQ points from being fuckin' retarded
So I gotta represent what I sell, niggas
(Chorus)
Impeach the President

I know I look like, Immortal Technique to you
But I created this genetic clone just to speak to you
Me and 279
, 
are planting a bomb in the building
Coz' underground shows never got women and children
I'm serial killin', every fake nigga alive
So most people tryna’ rap won't survive
Machine gun everything around me like a panorama
And burn rubber with the ghost of Princess Diana
I'm like Santana, pulling strings in the game
While slaves emulate their masters living the same
Forget the fame
I can't rest a second alone
I got homeland security tapping my phone
But here's a warning to the government that creeps on me
I'm like a cum stained mattress - don't sleep on me
I roll deep, with a fully loaded AK
Murder cowards in their sleep like the I.R.A
I represent Zone 4 Dawg, that's the best hood
You catch a shot while you sittin in your whip like Tim Westwood
Whilin' out, you know how we doing persuing
And this is freestyle in the meanwhile
Other cats are spittin' a written bitten composition
You're crushed into submission
This is Harlem, you'll never rise to stardom kid
I came down to London, and you know how we did
And this is off the dome, off of the brain, lyrically insane
And that's how I'm tripping, that's how I'm flipping
Ay yo, check it out, 
now I'm the illest Latino
I never had to buy an album back like Benzino
You know I'm sick with the flow, spittin' it slow
And yo I had to go to the bathroom, I made a scramble
I lost 10 pounds, and I don't even gamble
So y'know, what's happening, when I'm rockin' it, off of the brain
Lyrically insane, Immortal Technique, saying you nice as me dawg?
You straight telling lies
Me and you have never been even like Biggie Small's eyes
When will you realize, Immortal Technique is iller
The socialist guerrilla, Stomp you like a stone pillar
Comin' through, representing whoever, cleverly, under the weather
Yo, it's like that the latin assasin a make it happen
I'm about to go platinum but when you see me up in the spot
Rockin' it hip-hop off the top of the knot
And yo, that's how it goes, that's how it flows, that's how it shows
Ay yo it's 96.9
Ay yo I substract the same numbers from both sides and thats 5-9
And that's fine, and I continue to climb
I continue to shine, I continue to climb
And yo, the voice of racism preaching the gospel, ayo thats devilish
A church in America called the prophet Muhammad a terrorist
Forgetting God is not a religion, but a spiritual bond
And Jesus is the most quoted prophet in the Qu'ran
They bombing innocent people, tryin' to murder Saddam
When they gave him those chemical weapons to go to war with Iran
This is the information that they hold back from Peter Jennings
Cause Condoleeza Rice is just a new age Sally Hemmings
I break it down with critical language and spiritual anguish
The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered him, stole his religion, and painted him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy
Conservative political right wing, ideology
Glued together sloppily, the blasphemy of a nation
I got my back to the wall, I'm facin' assassination
Guantanamo Bay, federal incarceration
How could this be, the land of the free, home of the brave?
Indigenous holocaust, 
and the home of the slaves
Corporate America, dancin' offbeat to the rhythm
They really think this country never sponsored terrorism
Human rights violations, we continue the saga
El Savador and the contras in Nicaragua
And on top of that, they still wanna take me to prison
Just cause I won't trade humanity for patriotism
Ayo I'm still bugging out I know you flipped the instrumental
Which coincidental I'm spitting off the top of the mental
Ay yo this government is tapping my phone
Like I told you before, I'm keeping it raw
I smash your kids hands in a car door
And thats how it goes, you know there’s ill and theirs crazy
Immortal Technique blazingly, amazing MCs
Yo, I'm hangin' out with the illest rappers alive
And yo I strive to be better, I strive to survive
I strive to strap a live wire to the top of my brain
I make cuts on my dick with masochistic tactics
And then take a fat ish
While simultaneously stabbing a pregnant fat bitch
On a vomit-covered mattress
While the featus uses my dick to practice gymnastics
Dancing on it like a balance beam doing backflips
Ay yo, I smack kids, and I compact them, ayo, I subtract them
And I'm keepin' this freestyle from the brain, I'm lyrically insane
Let me explain
Ayo, let me give you the rap-up from 2003
People went to war and they tried to drag me, and everyone else
And now we about to put Tony Blair back on the shelf
Were taking it ova', my word to Jehovah, I don't got a Range Rover
I be in the tube, I be at the (?)
Spitting on people's faces and whiling out
Ay yo no doubt, I keep it complete, Immortal Technique
And can even flip it in Spanish, make rappers vanish like
Immortal Technique, I be chillin', with my boy Clamento
Ay yo Ralph Dogg dot com, log on, so we can drop bombs
Yo, Bragging Rights to hook dot com
To Rock Steady, your not ready, won every battle in New York city
Your style is not pretty, kinda like Macy Gray, ahaha
And my faith in god is kinda shitty
I'll put my hand on a bible and tell Whoopi that shes pretty
And this is some mean stuff, that I'm spitting off the top of the brain
Ay yo you know how I rock, 2-7-9 that means you catching 18 shots
And thats how it goes, and thats how it flows, and I'm out of here
I'm out with your ho
I'm with your masters and the cash in the Jetta
Sinceramente
 - Technique - end of the letter

Yo,You're not as cold as me, motherfucker stop pretending
I'll murder you in front of your crib like John Lennon
Rip the tendons out of your muscle to cut the tension
I'm beyond your comprehension like related subatomic particles and fifth dimensions
Suspension in your breathing is what I'm leaving until a legion
Of demons whisper the meaning of life in your ear
Right before they make your motherfucking life disappear
But just because you hear the multi-syllabic grammatical
Don't compare me to rappers that are on sabbatical
Because I never did business in little fucking Italy
I play checkers on triple-decker tour buses in Tripoli
The way that you typically bicker with me inexplicably
Is a mystery that pisses me off ridiculously
Because I'm lyrically beyond your level scientifically
Specifically spitting out the spic in me prolifically
I'm the majority of America futuristically
After I die, fuck my music, you'll feel me spiritually
Darker than Sicily ripping above the averages
You hold no weight, like bitches after miscarriages
And your label produces no kids like gay marriages
I'm disparaging every fake thug rapper in sight
That's why your faggot ass will never make it into the light
I'll crack your skull when I smash your face into the mic
And now you know what I'm like
I'll Suge Knight the industry, I feel like the spirit of Nat Turner got into me
You're infinitely hopeless, you sound like shit when you spit live
Like Jennifer Lopez, I'll massacre a rich rapper
And all his broke friends, and go to Club Cheetah
Rocking some blood-soaked Tims, party crashing, animal-fucking model bitches
Leaving their stick-figure anorexic pussy in stitches
My verbal blitzes outshined your offense
You're watered down nonsense, and I'm two-hundred proof
Choking the local youth in this home-made vocal booth
You're a fucking incompetent killer like Rae Carruth
And I'm Technique, the rawest nigga ever produced
I spit nastier than regurgitating period juice
So burn your fucking rhyme book
Stay warm, and put it to good use
I'm about to drop like frozen airplane-shit through your roof
And I'm sick of fake hustlers telling lies to the youth
You never robbed Dominicans, 
and you couldn't sling rocks if you was Palestinian
You broke motherfucker, you cats don't burn rubber
You niggas can't even get a fucking cab like Danny Glover
You ain't hardcore, I'll smack the shit out of your mother
You wanna be gutter? I'll leave you laid out in the street
Signed yours truly, the motherfucking Immortal Technique

[Verse]
Yea... Yea... Ay yo
The things I've seen in life will make you choke by suprise
Like an aborted fetus in a jar that opened it's eyes
Provoking my demise, I'll leave your spirit broken inside
Like the feeling of 50 million people hoping you'd die
And niggas wonder why my heart is full of hatred and anger
Cause some bitch killed my firstborn son with a coat hanger
I strangled out the pain until my soul was empty and cold
Crippled and worthless,
 
so I thought that it could never be sold
My mother told me that placing my faith in God was the answer
But then I hated God cause he gave my mother cancer
Killing us slow like the Feds did to the Black Panthers
The genesis of genocide is like a Pagan religion
Carefully hidden, woven into the holidays of a Christian
I had a vision of nuclear holocaust on top of me
And this is prophecy, the words that I speak from my lungs
The severed head of John the Baptist speaking in tongues
Like Che Guevara my soliloquies speak through a gun
Pain in slow motion like
 
trees that reach for the sun
Nigga the preaching is done cause I don't got a DJ
Like
 
Reverend Run
, 
I curse the life of any man who kills
Benevolent ones
, 
I never asked to be the messenger
But I was chosen to speak the words of every African slave
Dumped in the ocean, stolen by America
Tortured, buried, and frozen
 
written out of the history books
Your children are holding
, 
internally bleeding, cold blooded
Stripped of emotion, I go through the motions, but there's no
Life in my eyes
, 
it's like I'm hooked up to a respirator
Waiting to die
, 
hooked up to the fucking chair
Waiting to fry, soothing an electrocution currently used
In my execution, producing thoughts at the speed of light
Burning confusion, I'm losing my sight, breathing is tigh
t
The evening is white
, 
I made my peace with the Lord and now I
Stand on his right..
[Hook]
Death is a another part of life..
These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
Dying on the inside, internally bleeding
Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning
These are my last words, I'm having difficultly breathing
Dying on the inside, internally bleeding
Angel of death dragging me away while I'm sleeping
Watching my world crumble in front of me, searching for meaning

This is the Invasion
The Evil Genius Green Lantern!
Immortal Technique, "The 3rd World"
It's on now motherfucker - ha, ha drop
You know you got the right to bear arms, huh
Sometimes you might have to brandish a motherfuckin firearm
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
[Hook]
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
Lick shots for the revolution!
Lick shots, lick shots, lick shots, lick shots
But watch, where the fuck you shootin'!
Yo, where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
Where the fuck you niggas aimin' at?
Where you aimin' at? Where you aimin' at?
This is only for the hardcore wherever you at, yeah
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
Volume 1, cop killer,
 
hip-hop has never been realer
Volume 2 shot up the president like a guerilla
New York police state capital tried to swallow me
Locked me longer than Puerto Rico been a colony
Thirteenth Amendment slavery property
And now they signin rappers that promote their philosophy
Fuck that, nigga hip-hop is not Republican
That's just the white motherfuckers that own the publishin
And get the fuck out, if you want the foreigners gone
I paint the White House black and park my car on the lawn
Marry a Muslum girl and fuck her five times a day
Every time right before we shower and pray
You damn right the AK, symbolizes Jihad
But a holy war, is a conversation with God
You bitch niggas misinterpret what you don't understand
Stackin' the wrong sign can end up, shootin' your man
Shootin' each other, shootin' your brother
Aim the gun at the right motherfucker
And leave him colder than the prison in Russia
Or America's white power structure
Niggas love to say "Fuck revolution!"
Until the jury come in and move for the prosecution
And then brothers act like a born-again 
Huey Newton
Forgot about the bullshit music they was producin'
But my niggas aim precisely, through the confusion and
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Crooked-I]
I got a hundred shooters with me, Ruger shoot you through the kidney
Stand in front of the judge and lie quicker than Scooter Libby
I'm runnin' through the city, dear God
If I murk the racist Rush Limbaugh I wonder would you forgive me
Somebody told me Glenn Beck is the Klan’s overseer
See ya, time to let him see a damn soldier
Flip your Landrover, I told ya I blam toasters
Gun pop off like the mouth of Ann Coulter
This is my gangsta religion
See I aim with precision, point blank the position
I'm black as them ancient Egyptians
Before European historians went and changed the description
I'm blamed for the 'caine in the kitchen
The C.I.A. playin' with the pigeons, same pain that I'm pitchin'
Listen, you dudes better watch the hook
I'm a boxer, coppers'll come up, Hoffa, look
They wanna get rid of this conscious crook
Like I'm an agnostic, apocryphal, non-canonical Gospel book
But I ain't goin' nowhere, that's the motherfuckin' truth
America don't care for its inner city youth, so I
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Chino XL]
Puerto Rican superhero!
XL eternal, my journal, Sojourner, 
Nat Turner
Cop murdered by the certain burner turned in the back of his sternum
He flirted with pullin' me over for bein' brown, I bust
Now he in the back of the truck with 
Don Imus
I must, take aim when I lick shots
Throw stray bullets like when Nas got off of Pharoahe Monch
These pigs wanna see us dead inside a jail cell
Turn us from Shawn Carter to Sean Combs to Sean Bell
My temper 'bout to break like levees in New Orleans
Catch Jimmy Iovine when he refinance his mortgages
Kid illusion is dead, we movin' with the blue and the red
Latin Kings, Giuliani with a gat to his head
Y'all don't lick shots like killers aimin' at the Feds
Y'all lick shots like Jenna Jameson and Superhead
Pigs slice to Venice and beef at the benefits meet
Buried him on Venice Beach with the flies and the bees
Chino
 and Immortal Tech'
Kill shit like the Chinito at Virginia Tech
And Jacob ain't your friend, he's a fuckin' jeweler
Blap! Blap! I shoot the cats off your fuckin' 
Pumas
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
They told me I would never make it, I would never achieve it
Reality is nourishment, but people don't believe it
I guess its hard to stomach the truth like a bulimic
It's a dirty game and nobody is willing to clean it
But this is for the paraplegic people dreamin' of runnin'
Ladies married to men who dont please 'em, dreamin' of comin'
Verbally murderous like David Berkowitz when I'm gunnin'
Some cowards on the internet didn't think I would sell
Scared to talk shit in person, cuz they stuck in a shell
And couldn't understand the pain of being stuck in a cell
Hell is not a place you go, if you're not a Christian
It's the failure of your life's greatest ambition
It's a bad decision to blindly follow any religion
I don't see the difference in between the wrong and the wrong
Soldiers emptyin' the clips at little kids and they moms
Are just like a desperate motherfucker strapped to a bomb
Humanity's gone, smoked up in a gravity bong
By a Democrat-Republican Cheech and Chong
Immortal Technique, you never heard me preach in a song
I'm not controversial, I'm just speakin' the facts
Put your hands in the air like you got the heat to your back
And shake your body like a baby born addicted to crack
And since life's a gamble like the craps tables at Vegas
I freestyle my destiny, it's not written in pages
[Verse 2]
I hate it when they tell us how far we came to be
As if our people's history started with slavery
Painfully I discovered the shit they kept us secret
This is the exodus like the black Jews out of Egypt
I keep it reality based with the music I make
Blow up the truth in your face with the style I run with
Like the navy missile that shot down flight eight hundred
I'm like the Africans who came here before Colombus
And from the 1500s until after the morrow
I watch Latin America get raped in the sorrow
You see the Spaniards never left
 
despues de Colon
And if you don't believe me, you can click on Univision
I never seen so much racism in all of my life
Every program and newscaster, all of them white
It's like Apartheid with ten percent ruling the rest
That type of stress will make me put the fucking tool to your chest
Step in my way nigga, I wouldn't wanna be ya
I burn slow like pissing drunk with gonorrhea
I'll do a free show in North Korea, burning the flag
While J. Edgar Hoover politicians dress up in drag
Try to confuse you, makin' it hard to follow this:
Capitalism and democracy are not synonymous
You swallow propaganda like a birth control pill
Sellin' your soul to the eye on the back of the dollar bill
But that will never be me, cuz I'm leavin' the past
Like an abused wife with the kids, leavin' your ass
Like a drug addict clean and sober, leavin' the stash
Unbreakable Technique, leavin' the plane crash
I'm out with the black box and I refuse to return
I spit reality, instead of what you usually learn
And I refuse to be concerned with condescending advice
Cuz I 'm the only motherfucker that could change my life
[
Ending
]
Some people think I won't make it, but I know that I will
Escape the emptiness cuz that shit is slow and it kills
The flow and the skill, I made y'all believe that it last
You can make the future, but it starts with leaving the past

[
James Nichols from Bowling for Columbine
]
Them people, law enforcement, if you want to call them that
Were here and they were shaking in their shoes. They were physically
Shaking, scared to death. Because certain people, said I'm a radical
I'm a wild man, I got a gun under every arm, if you say anything
I'll shoot you. If the people find out how they've been
Ripped off, and enslaved, they will revolt with the blood
Running in the streets
Yo, Ticket to ride, the white crime, highway
Bring all the guns, the funds will come my way
Whether we deliverin' high grade
To the people in the pit of the tri-state
Or dabble in the hood like fly weights
Lock and load in the range with rock the globe
Made any aim possible
Til the leadbelly lost control
In the hold of the paper that fold
At one time was related to gold
Made many men lose their soul
To the price of the dice that roll
How can a light so bright make a man so cold?
So another man's plans unfold
Can you really see the truth til it happens to you
Its so severe what the hopeless will do
Ain't no pickin' your position to beginning your life
Not every man want to stand by his kids and his wife
Too many lost kids in the night
Hand on heat, grippin' it tight
Any man want beef could get it right
Followed by enough flame to put a permanent end
To the learning of men
Class session, too many the blast the last lesson
Often taught like the wars that are often fought
As old as mankind
Now outta his damn mind
Stand on the gunpowder landmine
Ready to blow at any second
I'm checking for the signs of the end
Of all-time, I figure its on time, my last thoughts forming the rhyme
Got me running through the streets
That reek of the dead, its more food to the wealthy
My niggas on welfare, nobody givin' up healthcare
Nothing but heat, how you gonna tell me it ain't hell here?
George Bush having a swell year
Swingin' the gat, ready to clap, anything on the map
You done seen what they bring to Iraq
Now bring it back to the source, land of the physical force
Land of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun, land of the gun!
This is the place where the cops rush in the building
Paramilitary death squads murder your children
Empty shell of a man rippin' shots in the air
Soldiers dying out there, but nobody cares
Prepare for the future but make note of the past
Or be condemned to live it again and get blast
Class warfare kept outta the news
Replaced by a corporation's political views
Cause this is where the guns are manufactured and sold
The land that was stolen stripped of all of its gold
Old timers on the death bed speakin' the wisdom
Immigrants crucified by conservative Christians
Now we all got freedom to die in the street
But the difference is more of us die in a week
Than they die in a year
 I made it clear
Where I stand when the line is drawn
But now the line is gone
And nigga anything goes
The land where the guns don't let anything grow
And what the fuck you niggas know about living in hell
You not built like me you never lived in a cell
You never gambled with your soul
Fuck the ice on your hand, gun in your palm
But you got a niggas life in your hand
Young man, just remember that slicing a gram
Is a bloody game, like throwin' mice in a fan
My words flow like the rivers thats west of Iran
The fertile crescent moon, with the star in the middle
I reveal the depth of history's scars when I scribble
I gave you the world, and I ain't even charged you a little
The martyr is crippled
The prophets are dead and buried, but the message is simple
And its not written down in holy books as a riddle
Now we running through the streets, starvin'
On that guerilla warfare
My people stuck in a guerilla warfare
Innocent children screamin' in tears
You actin' like the army ain't put hell here
Military industry havin' a swell year
Swinging a gat while lying in heaven
Living off a blank check after 9/11
But I'm have the truth brought back to the source
Fight for my land with physical force
Speak through music, the subliminal course
I need a tech and a clip, fuck a chain and a Porsche
Land of the gun
, 
land of the gun
, 
land of the gun
, 
land of the gun

[Hook: Immortal Technique]
We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences
Muthafuckas say that violence is senseless
But so is getting slaughtered when you caught up defenceless
We in the trenches, on the offensive
Runnin' through machine gun fire and barbed wire fences,
 (
Rebel Armz
!)
Like the Viet Cong back with a vengeance
Your life is worthless but war is expensive
[Verse 1: Immortal Technique]
I'm like the spirit of the slave trade, follow the route
Why the fuck you think them hurricanes tear through the south?
And the Mid-Atlantic, starving the frantic
Stranded, abandoned, but I’m branded the hand of God
So I stand in command of the answer for radiation driven cancer
Tuskegee and the way that they murdered the Panthers
Back-up dancers for proposition 187
But my counter-proposition is a one eighty seven
I'll put a bounty on the head of a racist reverend
And drag his body through the streets on September 11th
My presence is like a Pentagon produced earthquake
Forced abortion to control the birth-rate
Planned incarceration with test scores from the 4th grade
New world order just completed the fourth stage
But before I ever surrender to the law
I'll turn this shit into Haiti, in 1794!
[Hook X2]
[Verse 2: J Arch ]
Now, respect I demand that, do your history
Give the Indians and Africans they land back
Bustin' my ass, while the man stand back, for minumun wage
Nah, I just don't understand that
My skill level way beyond collegiate
Capsize the boat and make the passengers sea sick
Smooth with that street shit, moons(?) who's I be with
Taking back what's ours like the people of Egypt
Rebel arms representer I pledge my allegiance
No matter how I do it I break through their defense
Fuck a false pretense or sensitive ass meanings
Germany getting nice on America's current events
North Korea nukes in the morning headlines for the evenings
We all cool as fuck, but they don't want to see us breathing
By the time she on the moon (?) check to see if they receive it
Madman militant it's strategic
[Hook X2]
[Verse 3: Hasan Salaam ]
This isn't just drums and rhythm, this is guns and ammunition
When its sung, redrum for the system
Let the slugs rumpapum, get it buck when you listen
Anarchist cookbook, I got the heat in the kitchen
Act up and wind up using a tube for the pot that you piss in
Sundiata spittin, yeah I rock for tradition
I'm a man on a mission like Clarence 13
Or the great Saladin leading the Mujahideen
Make moves like Kasparov, with a sawed-off and Molotov
Flows synonymous with the kickback of a Kalashnikov
Mossberg Upanishads, punishing your promenade
Like Arch Duke Ferdinand BONG in front your entourage
Rebel Armz firing squad, lugers to bazookas
Minds balanced with the talents of Larry Davis & Lumumba
Laying grounds for the future, Cairo on the 25th
All power to the people when that 5th Column spits

[Intro]
Yeah nigga, Immortal Technique, 
metaphysics
[Verse 1]
The bling-bling era was cute but it's about to be done
I leave ya full of clips
 
like the moon blockin' the sun
My metaphors are dirty like herpes but harder to catch
Like an escape tunnel in prison I started from scratch
And now these parasites wanna percent of my ASCAP
Tryin' to control perspective like an acid flashback
But here's a quotable for every single record exec
"Get your fuckin' hands out my pocket nigga" like Malcolm X
But this ain't a movie, I'm not a fan or a groupie
And I'm not that type of cat, you can afford to miss if you shoot me
Curse to heavens and laugh when the sky electrocutes me
Immortal Technique stuck in your thoughts darkening dreams
No ones as good as me, they just got better marketing schemes
I'll lead you to your own destruction like sparkin' a fiend
Cuz you got jealousy in your voice like Starscream
And that's the primary reason that I hate ya'll faggots
I've been nice since niggas got killed over 8-ball jackets
And Reebok Pumps that didn't do shit for the sneaker
I'm a heatseaker with features that'll reach through the speaker
And murder counter-revolutionaries personally
Break a thermometer and force feed his kids mercury
A&R's tried jerking me thinking they call shots
Offered me a deal and a blanket full of smallpox
You're all getting shot, you little fucking treacherous bitches
[Hook]
This is the business, and ya'll ain't getting nothing for free
And if you devils play broke, then I'm taking your company
You can call it reparations or restitution
Lock and load nigga,
 
industrial revolution
[Verse 2]
I want fifty three million dollars for my calloused hands
Like the Bush administration gave to the Taliban
And fuck packing grams nigga, learn to speak and behave
You wanna spend twenty years as a government slave?
Two million people in prison keep the government paid
Stuck in a six by eight cell alive in the grave
I was made by Revolution to speak to the masses
Deep in the club toast the truth, reach for you glasses
I'll burn an orphanage just to bring heat to you bastards
Innocent deep in a casket, Colombian fashion
Intoxicated off the flow like thugs passion
You motherfuckers will never get me to stop blastin'
You're better off asking Ariel Sharon for compassion
You're better off begging for twenty points from a label
You're better off battling cancer under telephone cables
Technique chemically unstable, set to explode
Foretold by the dead sea scrolls written in code
So if your message ain't shit, fuck the records you sold
Cause if you go platinum, it's got nothing to do with luck
It just means that a million people are stupid as fuck
Stuck in the underground, a general that rose to the limit
Without distribution managers, a deal, or a gimmick
Revolutionary Volume 2, murder the critics
And leave your fucking body rotting for the roaches and crickets
[Hook]

[Verse One: Immortal Technique]
Yo, they say my words are sinister
So they plottin' my death
Like Nation of Islam Ministers did to Malcolm X
But I'm never stressed I stay with the gat in the ride
Ready for beef like Chicago, with my hat to the side
Glock in the clip, locked and loaded with the body armor
Cold blooded. I don't give a fuck about karma
Cuz if it never comes for those who benefit from misery
Ain't no motherfucking way it could ever do shit to me
There's nothing metaphysically deep about getting shot
Pissing in your pants and vomiting blood on tha block
Witness protection? Try to stay alive on the humble?
Niggas'll hunt you down like dinosaurs, alive in the jungle
And don't mumble when you try to disrespect my bars
I'll throw a chinese nigga at you, infected with SARS
Get banana boat niggas to murder you for a g
Get'em a green card and getchu chopped up for free
Butchu ain't even worth having your body buried
If you was locked up you'd be lap dancing for commissary
Cut the commentary, motherfucker nobody cares
You try to go to Thugs Mansion but nobody's there
Because the judgement day for you is an empty place
And I'm going to send you first class with a hole in your face
I'm taking your space nigga, don't act like you know me
Cause i'll fuck your girl whether she likes it or not, like i was Kobe
I'm Immortal Technique, nigga. You don't want to fuck with that
I'll beat the shit outta your bitch, and take her trucker hat
I'm still angry and bitter, got niggas laughing atchu after you die like John Ritter

Tony Kenyatta, what up baby?
[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Supreme Godhead, gutter like poverty
Righteous man is one of forty six parts prophecy
It’s epicyclical orbit like the hypotheses
It’s metaphysics that borders on the philosophy
Another song of yours is just another disaster
Another verse of mine is just another cadaver
You could call it a Genesis of another chapter
You could call it the 
venom
 that’s from the troubled rapper
The same rapper that was known for just smashing your face in
Who is God? What’s material manifestation?
I’m indestructible, 
my actions are that of a Mason
Yamasee Native American tribe of relations
The judge threw the book at me, I take it in blood
The rook move horizontally, basically drugs
A nation of intellectuals, a nation of thugs
Jesus is hate, a nation of Satan is love
[Hook: Poison Pen]
With a fist full of twenties
, got my mind right
With a fifth full of henny
, we Team Homicide
We swing side to side, so what’s happening’?
So what’s crackin’? So what’s stackin’?
If we falling out, then we brawling out
Vinnie chalk ‘em out, ain’t nothing to talk about
Team Homicide, swing side to side, so what’s happening’?
Yo, what’s happening? It’s all that shit...
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Me and my conglomerates shall survive Apocalypse
I charge a price for telling people what the process is
Living in a world where dictatorship is obvious
Natural resources running out for the populace
Murder doesn’t need a lobbyist or an ambassador
Ask the survivors of the Mỹ Lai massacre
‘Back to the Future’ without the flux capacitor
Kill you for the gold like Colonel Gaddafi characters
You bath salt sniffin’ zombies fuckin' a stranger
Navajo skin walkers, nigga, I’m a face changer
Surgically remove your heart, bury it at Wounded Knee
A microcosm of the graveyard that Earth is soon to be
A eulogy for those chasing cars and jewelry
I’m stocking food and water cause shit ain't what it used to be
I’m motivated like Buster Douglas when his mother died
Border Patrol, nigga, see you on the other side
[Hook]

[Poison Pen talking]
Yo, this Poison Pen
The album, its called The Money Shot
[Immortal Technique talking]
Most of yall muthafuckaz
Yall ‘Don’t even know what your rights are
You think your rights the opposite of your left (ahaha)
We have these rights, guaranteed to us
(Poison Pen – You ain't taking my burner nigga)
And once they get revoked...
(you gotta cut my finger off nigga)
Bueno es hora de revolución muthafucka!
[Immortal Technique]
I keep a burner stashed
Loaded up with hollow tips
Cause’ politics can turn your city into the Gaza Strip
Military industry, justify sales like a drug dealer lyrically
Fucked up physically
But halving two sides doesn’t imply symmetry
Cause’ Philly to Filastin, our children are fricassee
Times up, like the Celestine prophecy
My paper is folded now, no more chances to copy me
Them ghetto philosophies will get yourself killed
If I don’t sell them the product “somebody else will”
America, like it or not, I represent you
You teach me and sell me the weapons to use against you
My stray hands used to sack cities for New York bitch
Now im Alaric
, 
Gaiseric
, 
four seventy six
Smart muthafuckaz from the hood learn history
Stupid niggas never learn shit and die religiously!
[Hook: Poison Pen and Immortal Technique]
Rebel Armz Locked and Loaded
The only law once the government is corroded
(2nd Amendment)
My life might be intense
But my rights will not be infringed
(2nd Amendment)
Is it propaganda for weapon companies
Or necessity in the country we see
(2nd Amendment)
Yeah, know this ___________
Not for whilin’ just for checks and balance
(2nd Amendment)
[Poison Pen]
I walk around town with the pound strapped down on my side
No frontin’ just incase I gotta smoke somethin’
Sa gloves just incase I gotta choke somethin’
Hawk out just incase I gotta poke somethin’
Dirty dirty just incase I gotta go huntin’
Open case in the city, I don’t know nothin’
Random macs (no) you wanna play my circle?
My pedigree is made to _____ you
But we’ll hurt you!
[Immortal Technique]
Reverse AIDS commercial
Death equals silence
Anarchist, El Violen, reactionary violent
Cursed music out of a red violin
Only republicans I fuck with live in Northern Ireland
Warrior chief liken the beast from the east
Drive-by in the drive-thru, we share beef with police
One for the Bronx, for Queens, for them Oakland streets
Fuckin’ empty the clip in em’ for my peoples in Greece
Nigga!
[Hook]
[Poison Pen]
Mr Obama, congratulations on that win
Don't take away my right to hold my llama
I’m a citizen, like that dude in that militia
No felonies, unlike that dude in that militia
Antebellum statues paved the way for me
It’s registered with the state dawg
Its day of the siege
Police won't protect me, the beast won't protect me
I stand back to back with the gats with Technique
We called "Rebel Armz" for a reason
I defend hoods with heaterz
Like Condoleeza’s pops
Pack off, Pop off, on them evil cops
Torch yours, I torch mine
That's when the bleeding stop
Tryna’ confiscate mine
So you can catch and drive my grey piece
I’m Haiti in the seventy nineties (Sak Pasé)
Control em’, border
The government sponsored slaughter
We supreme
Revolution, how this land was founded
[Hook]
[Immortal Technique talking]
Yeah, Immortal Technique, Poison Pen
Stronghold / Rebel Armz
Hahaha
You gotta know your rights pussy
So that, when they break the law on you
You know how to break the law on them
Hahaaha...
