[Verse 1]
When she said
“Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”
I cried she was deaf
And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes
Then said, “What else you got left?”
It was then that I got up to leave
But she said, “Don’t forget
Everybody must give something back
For something they get”
[Verse 2]
I stood there and hummed
I tapped on her drum and 
asked her how come
And she buttoned her boot
And straightened her suit
Then she said, “Don’t get cute”
So I forced my hands in my pockets
And felt with my thumbs
And gallantly handed her
My very last piece of gum
[Verse 3]
She threw me outside
I stood in the dirt where everyone walked
And after finding out I’d
Forgotten my shirt
I went back and knocked
I waited in the hallway, she went to get it
And I tried to make sense
Out of that picture of you in your wheelchair
That leaned up against
[Verse 4]
Her Jamaican rum
And when she did come, I asked her for some
She said, “No, dear”
I said, “Your words aren’t clear
You’d better spit out your gum”
She screamed till her face got so red
Then she fell on the floor
And I covered her up and then
Thought I’d go look through her drawer
[Verse 5]
And when I was through
I filled up my shoe
And brought it to you
And you, you took me in
You loved me then
You didn’t waste time
And I, I never took much
I never asked for your crutch
Now don’t ask for mine

[George Harrison Cover][Verse 1]
I can see the 
turning of the key
I’ve been deceived by the 
clown inside of me
I thought that he was righteous but he’s vain
Oh, something’s a-telling me 
I wear the ball and chain
[Verse 2]
My patron saint is a-fighting with a ghost
He’s always off somewhere when I need him most
The Spanish moon is rising on the hill
But my heart is a-tellin’ me I love ya still
[Verse 3]
I come back to the town from the flaming moon
I see you in the streets, I begin to swoon
I love to see you dress before the mirror
Won’t you let me in your room one time ’fore I finally disappear?
[Verse 4]
Everybody’s wearing a disguise
To hide what they’ve got left behind their eyes
But me, I can’t cover what I am
Wherever the children go I’ll follow them
[Verse 5]
I march in the parade of liberty
But as long as I love you I’m not free
How long must I suffer such abuse
Won’t you let me see you smile one time before I turn you loose?
[Verse 6]
I’ve given up the game, I’ve got to leave
The pot of gold is only make-believe
The treasure can’t be found by men who search
Whose gods are dead and whose queens are in the church
[Verse 7]
We sat in an empty theater and we kissed
I asked ya please to cross me off-a your list
My head tells me it’s time to make a change
But my heart is telling me I love ya but you’re strange
[Verse 8]
One more time at midnight, near the wall
Take off your heavy makeup and your shawl
Won’t you descend from the throne, from where you sit?
Let me feel your love one more time before I abandon it

[Verse 1]
Well, your railroad gate, you know I just can’t jump it
Sometimes it gets so hard, you see
I’m just sitting here beating on my trumpet
With all these promises you left for me
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Verse 2]
Well, I waited for you when I was half sick
Yes, I waited for you when you hated me
Well, I waited for you inside of the frozen traffic
When you knew I had some other place to be
Now, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
Well, anybody can be just like me, obviously
But then, now again, not too many can be like you, fortunately
[Verse 3]
Well, six white horses that you did promise
Were fin’lly delivered down to the penitentiary
But to live outside the law, you must be honest
I know you always say that you agree
But where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Verse 4]
Well, I don’t know how it happened
But the riverboat captain, he knows my fate
But everybody else, even yourself
They’re just gonna have to wait
[Verse 5]
Well, I got the fever down in my pockets
The Persian drunkard, he follows me
Yes, I can take him to your house but I can’t unlock it
You see, you forgot to leave me with the key
Oh, where are you tonight, sweet Marie?
[Verse 6]
Now, I been in jail when all my mail showed
That a man can’t give his address out to bad company
And now I stand here lookin’ at your yellow railroad
In the ruins of your balcony
Wond’ring where you are tonight, sweet Marie

[Verse 1]
Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains
I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways
I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests
I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans
I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard
And it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
[Verse 2]
Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what did you see, my darling young one?
I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it
I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it
I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping
I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding
I saw a white ladder all covered with water
I saw ten thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken
I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
And it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
[Verse 3]
And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?
And what did you hear, my darling young one?
I heard the sound of a thunder, it roared out a warning
Heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world
Heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing
Heard ten thousand whispering and nobody listening
Heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing
Heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter
Heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley
And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
And it’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
[Verse 4]
Oh, who did you meet, my blue-eyed son?
Who did you meet, my darling young one?
I met a young child beside a dead pony
I met a white man who walked a black dog
I met a young woman whose body was burning
I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow
I met one man who was wounded in love
I met another man who was wounded with hatred
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall
[Verse 5]
Oh, what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, what will you do now, my darling young one?
I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling
I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest black forest
Where the people are many and their hands are all empty
Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters
Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison
Where the executioner’s face is always well hidden
Where hunger is ugly, where souls are forgotten
Where black is the color, where none is the number
And I’ll tell it and think it and speak it and breathe it
And reflect it from the mountain so all souls can see it
Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking
But I’ll know my song well before I start singing
And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard
It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall

[Verse 1]
Ain't no more cane on the 
Brazos
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Its all been ground down to molasses
Oh, oh- oh, oh- oh
[Verse 2]
You shoulda been on the river in 1910
They were driving the women just like they drove the men
Go down old Hannah, don'cha rise no more
Don't you rise up till judgment day's for sure
[Chorus]
Ain't no more cane on the Brazos
Its all been ground down to molasses
[Verse 3]
Captain, don't you do me like you done poor old shine
Well ya drove that bully till he went stone blind
Wake up on a lifetime, hold up your own head
Well you may get a pardon and then you might drop dead
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
As I walked out tonight in the mystic garden
The wounded flowers were dangling from the vines
I was passing by yon cool and crystal fountain
Someone hit me from behind
[Verse 2]
Ain't talkin', just walking'
Through this weary world of woe
The heart is burning', still yearnin'
No one on earth would ever know
[Verse 3]
They say prayer has the power to help
So pray from the mother
In the human heart an evil spirit can dwell
I'm trying to love my neighbor and do good unto others
But oh, mother, things ain't going well
[Verse 4]
Ain't talkin', just walking'
I'll burn that bridge before you can cross
The heart is burning', still yearnin'
They'll be no mercy for you once you've lost
[Verse 5]
Now I'm all worn down by weeping'
My eyes are filled with tears, my lips are dry
If I catch my opponents ever sleeping'
I'll just slaughter them where they lie
[Verse 6]
Ain't talkin', just walking'
Through the world mysterious and vague
The heart is burning', still yearnin'
Walking through the cities of the plague
[Verse 7]
The whole world is filled with speculation
The whole wide world which people say is round
They will tear your mind away from contemplation
They will jump on your misfortune when you're down
[Verse 8]
Ain't talkin', just walking'
Eating' hog-eyed grease in a hog-eyed town
The heart is burning' – still yearnin'
Someday you'll be glad to have me around
[Verse 9]
They will crush you with wealth and power
Every waking moment you could crack
I'll make the most of one last extra hour
I'll avenge my father's death then I'll step back
[Verse 10]
Ain't talkin', just walking'
Hand me down my walking' cane
The heart is burning', still yearnin'
Got to get you out of my miserable brain
[Verse 11]
All my loyal and much-loved companions
They approve of me and share my code
I practice a faith that's been long abandoned
Ain't no altars on this long and lonesome road
[Verse 12]
Ain't talkin', just walking'
My mule is sick, my horse is blind
The heart is burning', still yearnin'
Thinking' ‘bout that gal I left behind
[Verse 13]
It's bright in the heavens and the wheels are flying
Fame and honor never seem to fade
The fire's gone out but the light is never dying
Who says I can't get heavenly aid?
[Verse 14]
Ain't talkin', just walking'
Carrying a dead man's shield
Heart burning, still yearning
Walking with a toothache in my heel
[Verse 15]
The suffering is unending
Every nook and cranny has its tears
I'm not playing, I'm not pretending
I'm not nursing any superfluous fears
[Verse 16]
Ain't talkin', just walking
Walking ever since the other night
Heart burning, still yearnin'
Walking ‘till I'm clean out of sight
[Verse 17]
As I walked out in the mystic garden
On a hot summer day, hot summer lawn
Excuse me, ma'am, I beg your pardon
There's no one here, the gardener is gone
[Verse 18]
Ain't talking, just walking
Up the road around the bend
Heart burning, still yearning
In the last outback, at the world's end

[Verse 1]
"There must be some way out of here"
Said the joker to the thief
"There's too much confusion
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them along the line
Know what any of it is worth"
[Verse 2]
"No reason to get excited"
The thief he kindly spoke
"There are many here among us
Who feel that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And this is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
The hour is getting late"
[Verse 3]
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too
[Verse 4]
Outside in the distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
The wind began to howl

[Verse 1]
As I went out one morning
To breathe the air around Tom Paine’s
I spied the fairest damsel
That ever did walk in chains
I offered her my hand
She took me by the arm
I knew that very instant
She meant to do me harm
[Verse 2]
“Depart from me this moment”
I told her with my voice
Said she, “But I don’t wish to”
Said I, “But you have no choice”
“I beg you, sir,” she pleaded
From the corners of her mouth
“I will secretly accept you
And together we’ll fly south”
[Verse 3]
Just then Tom Paine, himself
Came running from across the field
Shouting at this lovely girl
And commanding her to yield
And as she was letting go her grip
Up Tom Paine did run
“I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me
“I’m sorry for what she’s done”

[Intro]
I first heard this from Ric von Schmidt.
 
He lives in Cambridge
Ric is a blues guitar player. I met him one day in
The green pastures of the Harvard University
[Chorus]
Baby let me follow you down
Baby let me follow you down
Well I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down
[Verse 1]
Can I come home with you
Baby can I come home with you?
Yes I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me come home with you
[Chorus]
[Outro]
Yes I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down
[Additional Verses (1966 live version)]
I'll buy you a diamond ring
Yes, I'll buy you a wedding gown
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just let me follow you down
I'll buy you rope and twine
Honey, just for you to climb
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just once drive me out of my mind
Buy you a hoop and skirt
I'll buy you a velvet shirt
Yes, I'll do anything in this god almighty world
If you just don't make me hurt

[Verse 1]
I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze
With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn
I courted her proudly but now she is gone
Gone as the season she's taken
[Verse 2]
In a young summer's youth, I stole her away
From her mother and sister, though close did they stay
Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day
With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us
[Verse 3]
Of the two sisters, I loved the young
With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one
The constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone
By the jealousy of others around her
[Verse 4]
For her parasite sister, I had no respect
Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect
Countless visions of the other she'd reflect
As a crutch for her scenes and her society
[Verse 5]
Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused
The changes I was going through can't even be used
For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose
The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime
[Verse 6]
With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip
A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped
Noticing not that I'd already slipped
To a sin of love's false security
[Verse 7]
From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace
Answers of emptiness voice vacancies
'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please
What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?
[Verse 8]
And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen
The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream
At the peak of the night, the king and the queen
Tumbled all down into pieces
[Verse 9]
"The tragic figure" her sister did shout
"Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"
And I in my armor, turning about
And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness
[Verse 10]
Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound
Her sister and I in a screaming battleground
And she in between, the victim of sound
Soon shattered as a child to the shadows
[Verse 11]
All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight
I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight
My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night
Leaving all of love's ashes behind me
[Verse 12]
The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet
The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
I think of her often and hope whoever she's met
Will be fully aware of how precious she is
[Verse 13]
Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me
"How good, how good does it feel to be free?"
And I answer them most mysteriously
"Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"

[Verse 1]
You walk into the room
With your pencil in your hand
You see somebody naked
And you say, "Who is that man?"
You try so hard
But you don't understand
Just what you'll say
When you get home
[Chorus]
Because something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
[Verse 2]
You raise up your head
And you ask, "Is this where it is?"
And somebody points to you and says
"It's his"
And you says, "What's mine ?"
And somebody else says, "Where what is?"
And you say, "Oh my God
Am I here all alone?"
[Chorus]
But something is happening here
But you don't know what it is
Do you, 
Mister Jones
?
[Verse 3]
You hand in your ticket
And you go watch the geek
Who immediately walks up to you
When he hears you speak
And says, "How does it feel
To be such a freak ?"
And you say, "Impossible"
As he hands you a bone
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
You have many contacts
Among the lumberjacks
To get you facts
When someone attacks your imagination
But nobody has any respect
Anyway they already expect you
To all give a check
To tax-deductible charity organizations
You've been with the professors
And they've all liked your looks
With great lawyers you have
Discussed lepers and crooks
You've been through all of
F. Scott Fitzgerald's books
You're very well read
It's well known
[Chorus]
But something is happening here
And you don't know what it is
Do you, Mister Jones?
[Verse 5]
Well, 
the sword swallower, he comes up to you
And then he kneels
He 
crosses
 himself
And then he clicks his high heels
And without further notice
He asks you how it feels
And he says, "Here is your throat back
Thanks for the loan"
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
Now you see this one-eyed midget
Shouting the word "NOW"
And you say, "For what reason?"
And he says, "How ?"
And you say, "What does this mean?"
And he screams back, "You're a cow
Give me some milk
Or else go home"
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
Well, you walk into the room
Like a camel and then you frown
You put your eyes in your pocket
And your nose on the ground
There ought to be a law
Against you coming around
You should be made
To wear earphones
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
Hollis Brown
He lived on the outside of town
With his wife and five children
And his cabin falling down
[Verse 2]
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
You looked for work and money
And you walked a rugged mile
Your children are so hungry
That they don’t know how to smile
[Verse 3]
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tugging at your sleeve
Your baby’s eyes look crazy
They’re a-tugging at your sleeve
You walk the floor and wonder why
With every breath you breathe
[Verse 4]
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
The rats have got your flour
Bad blood it got your mare
If there’s anyone that knows
Is there anyone that cares?
[Verse 5]
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
You prayed to the Lord above
Oh please send you a friend
Your empty pockets tell yuh
That you ain’t a-got no friend
[Verse 6]
Your babies are crying louder
It’s pounding on your brain
Your babies are crying louder now
It’s pounding on your brain
Your wife’s screams are stabbing you
Like the dirty driving rain
[Verse 7]
Your grass it is turning black
There’s no water in your well
Your grass is turning black
There’s no water in your well
You spent your last lone dollar
On seven shotgun shells
[Verse 8]
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Way out in the wilderness
A cold coyote calls
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That’s hanging on the wall
[Verse 9]
Your brain is a-bleeding
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your brain is a-bleeding
And your legs can’t seem to stand
Your eyes fix on the shotgun
That you’re holding in your hand
[Verse 10]
There’s seven breezes a-blowing
All around the cabin door
There’s seven breezes a-blowing
All around the cabin door
Seven shots ring out
Like the ocean’s pounding roar
[Verse 11]
There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
There’s seven people dead
On a South Dakota farm
Somewhere in the distance
There’s seven new people born

[Verse 1]
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
A pink hotel, a boutique and a swinging hot spot
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
[Verse 2]
They took all the trees, they put them in a tree museum
They charged the people a dollar and a half just to see them
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
[Verse 3]
Hey farmer, farmer, put away that D.D.T
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot
[Verse 4]
Late last night I heard my screen door slam
A big yellow taxi took away my old man
Don't it always go to show
You never know what you got till it's gone ?
They paved paradise, they put up a parking lot

[Verse 1]
Black Jack Davey come a-riden' on back
A-whistling loud and merry
Made the woods around him ring
And he charmed the heart of a lady
Charmed the heart of a lady
[Verse 2]
"How old are you, my pretty little miss
How old are you, my honey"
She answered to him with a lovin' smile
"I'll be sixteen come Sunday
Be sixteen come Sunday."
[Verse 3]
"Come and go with me, my pretty little miss
Come and go with me, my honey
Take you where the grass grows green
You never will want for money
You never will want for money
[Chorus]
"Pull off, pull off them high-heeled shoes
All made of Spanish leather
Get behind me on my horse
And we'll ride off together
We'll both go off together."
Well, she pulled off them high-heeled shoes
Made of Spanish leather
Got behind him on his horse
And they rode off together
They rode off together
[Verse 4]
At night the boss came home
Inquiring about this lady
The servant spoke before she thought
"She's been with Black Jack Dave
Rode off with Black Jack Davey."
[Verse 5]
"Well, saddle for me my coal black stud
He's speedier than the gray
I rode all day and I'll ride all night
And I'll overtake my lady
I'll bring back my lady."
[Verse 6]
Well, he rode all night till the broad daylight
Till he came to a river raging
And 
there he spied his darling bride
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Wrapped up with Black Jack Davey
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
"Would you forsake your house and home
Would you forsake your baby?
Would you forsake your husband, too
To go with Black Jack Davey
Rode off with Black Jack Davey?"
[Verse 8]
"Well, I'll forsake my house and home
And I'll forsake my baby
I'll forsake my husband, too
For the love of Black Jack Davey
Ride off with Black Jack Davey."
[Verse 9]
"
Last night I slept in a feather bed
Between my husband and baby
Tonight I lay on the river banks
In the arms of Black Jack Davey
Love my Black Jack Davey."

[Verse 1]
Seen the arrow on the doorpost
Saying, “This land is condemned
All the way from New Orleans
To Jerusalem”
I traveled through East Texas
Where many martyrs fell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
[Verse 2]
Well, I heard that hoot owl singing
As they were taking down the tents
The stars above the barren trees
Were his only audience
Them charcoal gypsy maidens
Can strut their feathers well
But nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
[Verse 3]
See them big plantations burning
Hear the cracking of the whips
Smell that sweet magnolia blooming
See the ghosts of slavery ships
I can hear them tribes a-moaning
Hear that undertaker’s bell
Nobody can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
[Verse 4]
There’s a woman by the river
With some fine young handsome man
He’s dressed up like a squire
Bootlegged whiskey in his hand
There’s a chain gang on the highway
I can hear them rebels yell
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell
[Verse 5]
Well, God is in His heaven
And we all want what’s His
But power and greed and corruptible seed
Seem to be all that there is
I’m gazing out the window
Of the 
St. James Hotel
And I know no one can sing the blues
Like Blind Willie McTell

[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
[Verse 2]
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it is washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
And pretend that he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
[Verse 3]
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Verse 1]
While riding on a train going west
I fell asleep for to take my rest
I dreamed a dream that made me sad
Concerning myself and the first few friends I had
[Verse 2]
With half-damp eyes I stared to the room
Where my friends and I spent many an afternoon
Where we together weathered many a storm
Laughing and singing till the early hours of the morn
[Verse 3]
By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung
Our words were told, our songs were sung
Where we longed for nothing and were quite satisfied
Talking and a-joking about the world outside
[Verse 4]
With haunted hearts through the heat and cold
We never thought we could ever get old
We thought we could sit forever in fun
But our chances really was a million to one
[Verse 5]
As easy it was to tell black from white
It was all that easy to tell wrong from right
And our choices were few and the thought never hit
That the one road we traveled would ever shatter and split
[Verse 6]
How many a year has passed and gone
And many a gamble has been lost and won
And many a road taken by many a friend
And each one I’ve never seen again
[Verse 7]
I wish, I wish, I wish in vain
That we could sit simply in that room again
Ten thousand dollars at the drop of a hat
I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that

[Verse 1]
Oh, I’m sailing away my own true love
I’m sailing away in the morning
Is there something I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I’ll be landing?
[Verse 2]
No, there’s nothing you can send me, my own true love
There’s nothing I wish to be owning
Just carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean
[Verse 3]
Oh, but I just thought you might want something fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona
[Verse 4]
Oh, but if I had the stars from the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I’d forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that’s all I’m wishing to be owning
[Verse 5]
That I might be gone a long time
And it’s only that I’m asking
Is there something I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passing
[Verse 6]
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I want from you today
I would want again tomorrow
[Verse 7]
I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailing
Saying I don’t know when I’ll be coming back again
It depends on how I’m a-feeling
[Verse 8]
Well, if you, my love, must think that-a-way
I’m sure your mind is roaming
I’m sure your heart is not with me
But with the country to where you’re going
[Verse 9]
So take heed, take heed of the western wind
Take heed of the stormy weather
And yes, there’s something you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather

[Verse 1]
In the lonely night
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light
You’re coming’ thru to me in black and white
When we were made of dreams
[Verse 2]
You’re blowing down the shaky street
You’re hearing my heart beat
In the record-breaking heat
Where we were born in time
[Verse 3]
Not one more night, not one more kiss
Not this time baby, no more of this
Takes too much skill, takes too much will
It’s revealing
[Verse 4]
You came, you saw, just like the law
You married young, just like your ma
You tried and tried, you made me slide
You left me reeling with this feeling
[Verse 5]
On the rising curve
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve
You won’t get anything you don’t deserve
Where we were born in time
[Verse 6]
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice
You hang the flame, you’ll pay the price
Oh babe, that fire
[Verse 7]
Is still smoking
You were snow, you were rain
You were striped, you were plain
Oh babe, truer words
Have not been spoken or broken
[Verse 8]
In the hills of mystery
In the foggy web of destiny
You can have what’s left of me
Where we were born in time

[Verse 1]
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drivin' wheel
You all been down and lonesome, you know just how a poor man feels
[Verse 2]
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke
Been shooting craps and gambling, momma, and I done got broke
I done pawned my pistol, baby, my best clothes been sold
[Chorus]
Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord, Lordy, Lord
Lordy, Lord
[Verse 3]
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees
I went down in my praying ground, fell on my bended knees
I ain't cryin' for no religion, Lord, give me back my good gal please
[Verse 4]
If you give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more
Give me back my baby, I won't worry you no more
Don't have to put her in my house, Lordy, just lead her to my door
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
Can't you hear me, baby, rappin' on your door?
Now you hear me tappin', tappin' across your floor
[Verse 6]
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no drive at all
What make me love my woman, she can really do the Georgia Crawl
[Verse 7]
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell
Feel like a broke-down engine, ain't got no whistle or bell
If you're a real hot momma, come take away Daddy's weeping spell

[Verse 1]
Well, there was this movie I seen one time
About a man riding ’cross the desert and it starred Gregory Peck
He was shot down by a hungry kid trying to make a name for himself
The townspeople wanted to crush that kid down and string him up by the neck
[Verse 2]
Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp
As the dying gunfighter lay in the sun and gasped for his last breath
“Turn him loose, let him go, let him say he outdrew me fair and square
I want him to feel what it’s like to every moment face his death”
[Verse 3]
Well, I keep seeing this stuff and it just comes a-rolling in
And you know it blows right through me like a ball and chain
You know I can’t believe we’ve lived so long and are still so far apart
The memory of you keeps calling after me like a rolling train
[Verse 4]
I can still see the day that you came to me on the painted desert
In your busted down Ford and your platform heels
I could never figure out why you chose that particular place to meet
Ah, but you were right. It was perfect as I got in behind the wheel
[Verse 5]
Well, we drove that car all night into San Anton’
And we slept near the Alamo, your skin was so tender and soft
Way down in Mexico you went out to find a doctor and you never came back
I would have gone on after you but I didn’t feel like letting my head get blown off
[Verse 6]
Well, we’re driving’ this car and the sun is coming’ up over the Rockies
Now I know she ain’t you but she’s here and she’s got that dark rhythm in her soul
But I’m too over the edge and I ain’t in the mood anymore to remember the times
When I was your only man
And she don’t want to remind me. She knows this car would go out of control
[Hook]
Brownsville girl with your Brownsville curls
Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above
Brownsville girl, show me all around the world
Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love
[Verse 7]
Well, we crossed the panhandle and then we headed towards Amarillo
We pulled up where Henry Porter used to live. He owned a Wreckin’ lot outside of town about a mile
Ruby was in the backyard hanging clothes, she had her red hair tied back. She saw us come rolling up in a trail of dust
She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”
[Verse 8]
Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking’ of
Bumming a ride back from where she started
But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up
She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”
You could tell she was so broken hearted
She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”
[Verse 9]
“How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh
“We’re going all the way ’till the wheels fall off and burn
’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”
Ruby just smiled and said, “Ah, you know some babies never learn”
[Verse 10]
Something about that movie though, well I just can’t get it out of my head
But I can’t remember why I was in it or what part I was supposed to play
All I remember about it was Gregory Peck and the way people moved
And a lot of them seemed to be looking’ my way
[Hook]
[Verse 11]
Well, they were looking for somebody with a pompadour
I was crossing’ the street when shots rang out
I didn’t know whether to duck or to run, so I ran
“We got him cornered in the churchyard,” I heard somebody shout
[Verse 12]
Well, you saw my picture in the Corpus Christi Tribune. Underneath it
It said, “A man with no alibi”
You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you
Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears
It was the best acting I saw anybody do
[Verse 13]
Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass
But sometimes you just find yourself over the line
Oh if there’s an original thought out there, I could use it right now
You know, I feel pretty good, but that is not saying’ much. I could feel a whole lot better
If you were just here by my side to show me how
[Verse 14]
Well, I’m standing’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck
Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind
He’s got a new one out now, I don’t even know what it’s about
But I’ll see him in anything so I’ll stand in line
[Hook]
[Verse 15]
You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned
The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter
And you know there was something’ about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world
Just like you always said there was something’ about me you liked
That I left behind in the French Quarter
[Verse 16]
Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content
I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone
You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent
And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”
[Verse 17]
There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice
I don’t remember who I was or where I was bound
All I remember about it was it starred Gregory Peck, he wore a gun
And he was shot in the back
Seems like a long time ago, long before the stars were torn down
[Hook]

Bye and bye, I’m breathin’ a lover’s sigh
I’m sittin’ on my watch so I can be on time
I’m singin’ love’s praises with sugar-coated rhyme
Bye and bye, on you I’m casting my eye
I’m paintin’ the town—swinging my partner around
I know who I can depend on, I know who to trust
I’m watchin’ the roads, I’m studying the dust
I’m paintin’ the town making my last go-round
Well, I’m scufflin’ and I’m shufflin’ and I’m walkin’ on briars
I’m not even acquainted with my own desires
I’m rollin’ slow—I’m doing all I know
I’m tellin’ myself I found true happiness
That I’ve still got a dream that hasn’t been repossessed
I’m rollin’ slow, goin’ where the wild roses grow
Well the future for me is already a thing of the past
You were my first love and 
you
 will be my last
Papa gone mad, mamma, she’s feeling sad
I’m gonna baptize you in fire so you can sin no more
I’m gonna establish my rule through civil war
Gonna make you see just how loyal and true a man can be

[Verse 1]
Lazy stadium night
Catfish on the mound
“Strike three,” the umpire said
Batter have to go back and sit down
[Chorus]
Catfish, million-dollar-man
Nobody can throw the ball like Catfish can
[Verse 2]
Used to work on Mr. Finley’s farm
But the old man wouldn’t pay
So he packed his glove and took his arm
And one day he just ran away
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Come up where the Yankees are
Dress up in a pinstripe suit
Smoke a custom-made cigar
Wear an alligator boot
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Carolina born and bred
Love to hunt the little quail
Got a hundred-acre spread
Got some huntin’ dogs for sale
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Reggie Jackson at the plate
Seeing’ nothing’ but the curve
Swing too 
early or too late
Got to eat what Catfish serve
[Chorus]
[6Verse ]
Even Billy Martin grins
When the Fish is in the game
Every season twenty wins
Gonna make the Hall of Fame
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sixteen years
Sixteen banners united over the field
Where the good shepherd grieves
Desperate men, desperate women divided
Spreading their wings beneath falling leaves
[Verse 2]
Fortune
 calls
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born
On midsummer's eve near the tower
[Verse 3]
The cold-blooded moon
The captain waits above the celebration
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid
Whose ebony face is beyond communication
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid
[Verse 4]
They shaved her head
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow
Follow her down past the 
fountain
 where they lifted her veil
[Verse 5]
I stumbled to my feet
I rode past destruction in the ditches
With the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you
[Verse 6]
The palace of mirrors
Where dog soldiers are reflected
The endless road and the wailing of chimes
The empty rooms where her memory is protected
Where the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times
[Verse 7]
She wakes him up
Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks
[Verse 8]
Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards
But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards
[Verse 9]
Peace will come
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire
But will bring us no reward when her 
false idols
 fall
And cruel death surrenders
 with its pale ghost retreating
Between the 
King and the Queen of Swords

[Verse 1]
Far between sundown’s finish and midnight’s broken toll
We ducked inside the doorway, thunder crashing
As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds
Seeming to be the chimes of freedom flashing
Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight
Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight
And for each and every underdog soldier in the night
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
[Verse 2]
In the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched
With faces hidden while the walls were tightening
As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowing’ rain
Dissolved into the bells of the lightning
Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake
Tolling for the luckless, the abandoned and forsaked
Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
[Verse 3]
Through the mad mystic hammering
 of the wild ripping hail
The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder
That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze
Leaving only bells of lightning and its thunder
Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind
Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind
And the unpawned painter behind beyond his rightful time
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
[Verse 4]
Through the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales
For the disrobed faceless forms of no position
Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts
All down in taken-for-granted situations
Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute
Tolling for the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute
For the misdemeanor outlaw, chased and cheated by pursuit
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
[Verse 5]
Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flashed
And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting
Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones
Condemned to drift or else be kept from drifting
Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail
For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale
And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing
[Verse 6]
Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught
Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended
As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look
Spellbound and swallowed ’til the tolling ended
Tolling for the aching ones whose wounds cannot be nursed
For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse
And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe
And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing

[Verse 1]
I’m beginning to hear voices and there’s no one around
Well, I’m all used up and the fields have turned brown
I went to church on Sunday and she passed by
My love for her is taking such a long time to die
I’m waist deep, waist deep in the mist
It’s almost like, almost like I don’t exist
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
[Verse 2]
The walls of pride are high and wide
Can’t see over to the other side
It’s such a sad thing to see beauty decay
It’s sadder still to feel your heart torn away
One look at you and I’m out of control
Like the universe has swallowed me whole
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
[Verse 3]
There’s too many people, too many to recall
I thought some of ’m were friends of mine, I was wrong about ’m all
Well, the road is rocky and the hillside’s mud
Up over my head nothing but clouds of blood
I found my world, found my world in you
But your love just hasn’t proved true
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
[Verse 4]
Oh, the winds in Chicago have torn me to shreds
Reality has always had too many heads
Some things last longer than you think they will
There are some kind of things you can never kill
It’s you and you only I been thinking about
But you can’t see in and it’s hard lookin’ out
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
[Verse 5]
Well the fat’s in the fire and the water’s in the tank
The whiskey’s in the jar and the money’s in the bank
I tried to love and protect you because I cared
I’m gonna remember forever the joy that we shared
Looking at you and I’m on my bended knee
You have no idea what you do to me
I’m twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound
Twenty miles out of town in cold irons bound

[Verse 1]
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, where you been so long?
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, where you been so long?
I been worrying about you, baby
Baby, please come home
[Verse 2]
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
I got a bird that whistles
I got a bird that sings
But I am not a-got Corrina
Life don’t mean a thing
[Verse 3]
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, you’re on my mind
Corrina, Corrina
Girl, you’re on my mind
I’m a-thinking about you, baby
I just can’t keep from crying

[Verse 1]
Just like old Saxophone Joe
When he’s got the hogshead up on his toe
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie
[Verse 2]
Listen to the fiddler play
When he’s playing till the break of day
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie
[Verse 3]
Raspberry, strawberry, lemon and lime
What do I care?
Blueberry, apple, cherry, pumpkin and plum
Call me for dinner, honey, I’ll be there
[Verse 4]
Saddle me up my big white goose
Tie me on her and turn her loose
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie
[Verse 5]
I don’t need much and that ain’t no lie
Ain’t running any race
Give to me my country pie
I won’t throw it up in anybody’s face
[Verse 6]
Shake me up that old peach tree
Little Jack Horner’s got nothin’ on me
Oh me, oh my
Love that country pie

[Verse 1]
Covenant woman got a contract with the Lord
Way up yonder, great will be her reward
Covenant woman, shining like a morning star
I know I can trust you to stay where you are
[Chorus]
And I just got to tell you
I do intend
To stay closer than any friend
I just got to thank you
Once again
For making your prayers known
Unto heaven for me
And to you, always, so grateful
I will forever be
[Verse 2]
I’ve been broken, shattered like an empty cup
I’m just waiting on the Lord to rebuild and fill me up
And I know He will do it ’cause He’s faithful and He’s true
He must have loved me so much to send me someone as fine as you
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Covenant woman, intimate little girl
Who knows those most secret things of me that are hidden from the world
You know we are strangers in a land we’re passing through
I’ll always be right by your side, I’ve got a covenant too
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
They’re selling postcards of the hanging
They’re painting the passports brown
The beauty parlor is filled with sailors
The circus is in town
Here comes the blind commissioner
They’ve got him in a trance
One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker
The other is in his pants
And the 
 they’re restless
They need somewhere to go
As Lady and I look out tonight
From Desolation Row
[Verse 2]
Cinderella, she seems so easy
“It takes one to know one,” she smiles
And puts her hands in her back pockets
Bette Davis style
And in comes Romeo, he’s moaning
“You Belong to Me I Believe”
And someone says, “You’re in the wrong place my friend
You better leave”
And the only sound that’s left
After the ambulances go
Is Cinderella sweeping up
On Desolation Row
[Verse 3]
Now the moon is almost hidden
The stars are beginning to hide
The fortune-telling lady
Has even taken all her things inside
All except for 
And the 
 Dame
Everybody is making love
Or else expecting rain
And the Good Samaritan, he’s dressing
He’s getting ready for the show
He’s going to the carnival tonight
On Desolation Row
[Verse 4]
Now Ophelia
, 
she’s ’neath the window
For her I feel so afraid
On her twenty-second birthday
She already is an old maid
To her, death is quite romantic
She wears an iron vest
Her profession’s her religion
Her sin is her lifelessness
]
And though her eyes are fixed upon
Noah’s great rainbow
She spends her time peeking
Into Desolation Row
[Verse 5]
Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood
With his memories in a trunk
Passed this way an hour ago
With 
 friend, a jealous monk
He looked so immaculately frightful
As he bummed a cigarette
Then he went off sniffing drainpipes
And reciting the alphabet
Now you would not think to look at him
But he was famous long ago
For playing the electric violin
On Desolation Row
[Verse 6]
Dr. Filth, he keeps his world
Inside of a leather cup
But all his sexless patients
They’re trying to blow it up
Now his nurse, some local loser
She’s in charge of the cyanide hole
And she also keeps the cards that read
“Have Mercy on His Soul”
They all play on pennywhistles
You can hear them blow
If you lean your head out far enough
From Desolation Row
[Verse 7]
Across the street they’ve nailed the curtains
They’re getting ready for the feast
The Phantom of the Opera
A 
 of a priest
They’re spoonfeeding Casanova
To get him to feel more assured
Then they’ll kill him with self-confidence
After poisoning him with words
And the Phantom’s shouting to 
“Get Outa Here If You Don’t Know
Casanova is just being punished for going
To Desolation Row”
[Verse 8]
Now at midnight all the agents
And the superhuman crew
Come out and round up everyone
That knows more than they do
Then they bring them to the factory
Where the heart-attack machine
Is strapped across their shoulders
And then the kerosene
Is brought down from the castles
By insurance men who go
Check to see that nobody is escaping
To Desolation Row
[Verse 9]
Praise be to Nero’s Neptune
The Titanic sails at dawn
And everybody’s shouting
“Which Side Are You On?”
And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot
Fighting in the captain’s tower
While calypso singers laugh at them
And fishermen hold flowers
Between the windows of the sea
Where lovely mermaids flow
And nobody has to think too much
About Desolation Row
[Verse 10]
Yes, I received your letter yesterday
(About the time the doorknob broke)
When you asked how I was doing
Was that some kind of joke?
All these people that you mention
Yes, I know them, they’re quite lame
I had to rearrange their faces
And give them all another name
Right now I can’t read too good
Don’t send me no more letters, no
Not unless you mail them
From Desolation Row

[Verse 1]
Fat man looking in a blade of steel
Thin man looking at his last meal
Hollow man looking in a cotton field
For dignity
[Verse 2]
Wise man looking in a blade of grass
Young man Looking in the shadows that pass
Poor man looking through painted glass
For dignity
[Verse 3]
Somebody got murdered on New Year’s Eve
Somebody said dignity was the first to leave
I went into the city, went into the town
Went into the land of the midnight sun
[Verse 4]
Searching high, searching low
Searching everywhere I know
Asking the cops wherever I go
Have you seen dignity?
[Verse 5]
Blind man breaking out of a trance
Puts both his hands in the pockets of chance
Hoping to find one circumstance
Of dignity
[Verse 6]
I went to the wedding of Mary Lou
She said, “I don’t want nobody see me talking to you”
Said she could get killed if she told me what she knew
About dignity
[Verse 7]
I went down where the vultures feed
I would’ve gone deeper, but there wasn’t any need
Heard the tongues of angels and the tongues of men
Wasn’t any difference to me
[Verse 8]
Chilly wind sharp as a razor blade
House on fire, debts unpaid
Gonna stand at the window, going to ask the maid
Have you seen dignity?
[Verse 9]
Drinking man listens to the voice he hears
In a crowded room full of covered-up mirrors
Looking into the lost forgotten years
For dignity
[Verse 10]
Met Prince Phillip at the home of the blues
Said he’d give me information if his name wasn’t used
He wanted money up front, said he was abused
By dignity
[Verse 11]
Footprints running across the silver sand
Steps going down into tattoo land
I met the sons of darkness and the sons of light
In the border towns of despair
[Verse 12]
Got no place to fade, got no coat
I’m on the rolling river in a jerkin boat
Trying to read a note somebody wrote
About dignity
[Verse 13]
Sick man Looking for the doctor’s cure
Looking at his hands for the lines that were
And into every masterpiece of literature
For dignity
[Verse 14]
Englishman stranded in the black-heart wind
Combing his hair back, his future looks thin
Bites the bullet and he looks within
For dignity
[Verse 15]
Someone showed me a picture and I just laughed
Dignity never been photographed
I went into the red, went into the black
Into the valley of dry bone dreams
[Verse 16]
So many roads, so much at stake
So many dead ends, I’m at the edge of the lake
Sometimes I wonder what it’s going to take
To find dignity

[Verse 1]
If I had wings
Like Noah's Dove
I’d fly the river
To the one I love
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
[Verse 2]
I had a man
Who was long and tall
Moved his body
Like a cannonball
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
[Verse 3]
Remember one evening
Was drizzling rain
And around my heart
I felt an aching pain
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
[Verse 4]
Once I wore
My apron low
Couldn’t keep you
Away from my door
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
[Verse 5]
Now my apron
Is up to my chin
You pass my door
But you never come in
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
[Verse 6]
Oh, mighty river
Runs muddy and wild
Can’t care the bloody
For my unborn child
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
[Verse 7]
Number 9 train
Won’t do no harm
Number 9 train
Take my poor baby home
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well
[Verse 8]
Fastest man
I ever saw
Skipped Missouri
On the way to Arkansas
Fare thee well, my honey
Fare thee well

[Verse 1]
It is no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don’t matter, anyhow
And it is no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don’t know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I’ll be gone
You’re the reason I’m traveling on
Don’t think twice, it’s all right
[Verse 2]
It is no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never know
And it is no use in turning on your light, babe
I’m on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
So don’t think twice, it’s all right
[Verse 3]
It is no use in calling out my name, girl
Like you never did before
It is no use in calling out my name, girl
I can’t hear you anymore
I’m a-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I’m told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don’t think twice, it’s all right
[Verse 4]
I’m walking down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I’m bound, I can’t tell
But goodbye’s too good a word, girl
So I’ll just say fare thee well
I am not saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don’t mind
You just kind of wasted my precious time
But don’t think twice, it’s all right

[Verse 1]
I was riding on the Mayflower
When I thought I spied some land
I yelled for Captain Arab
I have you understand
Who came running to the deck
Said, "Boys, forget the whale
Look on over yonder
Cut the engines
Change the sail
Haul on the bowline"
We sang that melody
Like all tough sailors do
When they are far away at sea
[Verse 2]
"I think I'll call it America"
I said as we hit the land
I took a deep breath
I fell down, I could not stand
Captain Arab he started
Writing up some deeds
He said, "Let's set up a fort
And start buying the place with beads"
Just then this cop comes down the street
Crazy as a loon
He throw us all in jail
For carrying harpoons
[Verse 3]
Ah me I busted out
Don't even ask me how
I went to get some help
I walked by a Guernsey cow
Who directed me down
To the Bowery slums
Where people carried signs around
Saying, "Ban the bums"
I jumped right into line
Saying "I hope that I'm not late"
When I realized I hadn't eaten
For five days straight
[Verse 4]
I went into a restaurant
Looking for the cook
I told him I was the editor
Of a famous etiquette book
The waitress he was handsome
He wore a powder blue cape
I ordered some suzette, I said
"Could you please make that crepe"
Just then the whole kitchen exploded
From boilling fat
Food was flying anywhere
And I left without my hat
[Verse 5]
Now, I didn't mean to be nosy
But I went into a bank
To get some bail for Arab
And all the boys back in the tank
They asked me for some collateral
And I pulled down my pants
They threw me in the alley
When up comes this girl from France
Who invited me to her house
I went, but she had a friend
Who knocked me out
And robbed my boots
And I was on the street again
[Verse 6]
Well, I rapped upon a house
With the US flag upon display
I said, "Could you help me out
I got some friends down the way
"The man says, "Get out of here
I'll tear you limb from limb"
I said, "You know they refused Jesus, too"
He said, "You're not Him
Get out of here before I break your bones
I ain't your pop"
I decided to have him arrested
And I went looking for a cop
[Verse 7]
I ran right outside
And I hopped inside a cab
I went out the other door
This Englishman said, "Fab"
As he saw me leap a hot dog stand
And a chariot that stood
Parked across from a building
Advertising brotherhood
I ran right through the front door
Like a hobo sailor does
But it was just a funeral parlor
And the man asked me who I was
[Verse 8]
I repeated that my friends
Where all in jail, with a sigh
He gave me his card
He said, "Call me if they die"
I shook his hand and said goodbye
Ran out to the street
When a bowling ball came down the road
And knocked me off my feet
A pay phone was ringing
It just about blew my mind
When I picked it up and said hello
This foot came through the line
[Verse 9]
Well, by this time I was fed up
At trying to make a stab
At bringing back any help
For my friends and captain Arab
I decided to flip a coin
Like either heads or tails
Would let me know if I should go
Back to the ship or back to jail
So I hocked my sailor suit
And I got a coin to flip
It came up tails
It rhymed with sails
So I made it back to the ship
[Verse 10]
Well, I got back and took
The parking ticket off the mast
I was ripping it to shreds
When this coastguard boat went past
They asked me my name
And I said, "Captain Kidd"
They believed me but
They wanted to know
What exactly that I did
I said for the 
Pope of Eruke
I was employed
They let me go right away
They were very paranoid
[Verse 11]
Well, the last I heard of Arab
He was stuck on a whale
That was married to the deputy
Sheriff of the jail
But the funniest thing was
When I was leaving the bay
I saw three ships a-sailing
There were all heading my way
I asked the captain what his name was
And how come he didn't drive a truck
He said his name was Columbus
I just said, "Good luck"

[Verse]
It isn't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter, anyhow
And it isn't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right
It isn't no use in turning on your light, babe
That light I never knowed
And it isn't no use in turning on your light, babe
I'm on the dark side of the road
Still I wish there was something you would do or say
To try and make me change my mind and stay
We never did too much talking anyway
So don't think twice, it's all right
It isn't no use in calling out my name, girl
Like you never did before
It isn't no use in calling out my name, girl
I can't hear you any more
I'm a-thinking and a-wondering all the way down the road
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul
But don't think twice, it's all right
I'm walking down that long, lonesome road, babe
Where I'm bound, I can't tell
But goodbye's too good a word, girl
So I'll just say fare thee well
I am not saying you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I don't mind
You just kinda wasted my precious time
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Verse 1]
Well, I’m walking down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand
Yes, I’m walking down the highway
With my suitcase in my hand
Lord, I really miss my baby
She’s in some far-off land
[Verse 2]
Well, your streets are getting empty
Lord, your highway’s getting filled
And your streets are getting empty
And your highway’s getting filled
Well, the way I love that woman
I swear it’s bound to get me killed
[Verse 3]
Well, I been gambling so long
Lord, I haven't got much more to lose
Yes, I been gambling so long
Lord, I haven't got much more to lose
Right now I’m having trouble
Please don’t take away my highway shoes
[Verse 4]
Well, I’m bound to get lucky, baby
Or I’m bound to die trying
Yes, I’m a-bound to get lucky, baby
Lord, Lord I’m a-bound to die trying
Well, meet me in the middle of the ocean
And we’ll leave this old highway behind
[Verse 5]
Well, the ocean took my baby
My baby stole my heart from me
Yes, the ocean took my baby
My baby took my heart from me
She packed it all up in a suitcase
Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy
[Verse 6]
So, I’m a-walking down your highway
Just as far as my poor eyes can see
Yes, I’m a-walking down your highway
Just as far as my eyes can see
From the Golden Gate Bridge
All the way to the Statue of Liberty

[Verse 1]
“Oh, help me in my weakness”
I heard the drifter say
As they carried him from the courtroom
And were taking him away
“My trip hasn’t been a pleasant one
And my time it isn’t long
And I still do not know
What it was that I’ve done wrong”
[Verse 2]
Well, the judge, he cast his robe aside
A tear came to his eye
“You fail to understand,” he said
“Why must you even try?”
Outside, the crowd was stirring
You could hear it from the door
Inside, the judge was stepping down
While the jury cried for more
[Verse 3]
“Oh, stop that cursed jury”
Cried the attendant and the nurse
“The trial was bad enough
But this is ten times worse”
Just then a bolt of lightning
Struck the courthouse out of shape
And while ev’rybody knelt to pray
The drifter did escape

[Verse 1]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gonna sweep my world away
I wanna stop at 
Carbondale
 and keep on going
That Duquesne train gon' 
rock me
 night and day
You say I'm a gambler, you say I'm a pimp
But I ain't neither one
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Sounding like it's on a final run
[Verse 2]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she never blowed before
Blue light blinking, red light glowing
Blowing like she's at my chamber door
You smiling through the fence at me
Just like you always smiled before
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she ain't gon' blow no more
[Verse 3]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing like the sky's gonna blow apart
You're the only thing alive that keeps me going
You're like a time bomb in my heart
I can hear a sweet voice steadily calling
Must be the mother of our Lord
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like my woman's on board
[Verse 4]
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' blow my blues away
You old rascal, I know exactly where you're going
I'll lead you there myself at the break of day
I wake up every morning with that woman in my bed
Everybody telling me she's gone to my head
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like it's gon' kill me dead
[Verse 5]
Can't you hear that Duquesne whistle blowing?
Blowing through another no good town
The lights on 
my native land
 are glowing
I wonder if they'll know me next time 'round
I wonder if that old oak tree's still standing
That old oak tree
, the one we used to climb
Listen to that Duquesne whistle blowing
Blowing like she's blowing right on time

[Verse 1]
All the early Roman kings
In their shark skin suits
Bow ties and buttons
High top boots
[Verse 2]
Drive-in' the spikes in *
Blazing' the rails
Nailed in their coffins
Top hats and tails
Fly away over
Fly away flap your wings
Fly by night
[Verse 3]
Like the early Roman kings
They're peddlers and they're meddlers
They buy and they sell
They destroyed your city
They'll destroy you as well
They're lecherous and treacherous
A-Hell bent for leather *
Each of 'em bigger
Than all men put together
Sluggers and muggers
Wearing fancy gold rings
All the women going crazy
For the early Roman kings

[Verse 1]
In the time of my confession, in the hour of my deepest need
When the pool of tears beneath my feet flood every newborn seed
There’s a dyin’ voice within me reaching out somewhere
Toiling in the danger and in the morals of despair
[Verse 2]
Don’t have the inclination to look back on any mistake
Like Cain, I now behold this chain of events that I must break
In the fury of the moment I can see the Master’s hand
In every leaf that trembles, in every grain of sand
[Verse 3]
Oh, the flowers of indulgence and the weeds of yesteryear
Like criminals, they have choked the breath of conscience and good cheer
The sun beat down upon the steps of time to light the way
To ease the pain of idleness and the memory of decay
[Verse 4]
I gaze into the doorway of temptation’s angry flame
And every time I pass that way I always hear my name
Then onward in my journey I come to understand
That every hair is numbered like every grain of sand
[Verse 5]
I have gone from rags to riches in the sorrow of the night
In the violence of a summer’s dream
, in the chill of a wintry light
In the bitter dance of loneliness fading into space
In the broken mirror of innocence on each forgotten face
[Verse 6]
I hear the ancient footsteps like the motion of the sea
Sometimes I turn, there’s someone there, other times it’s only me
I am hanging in the balance of the reality of man
Like every sparrow falling, like every grain of sand
[Harmonica solo]

[Verse 1]
Oh it’s fare thee well my darling’ true
I’m leaving’ in the first hour of the morn
I’m bound off for the bay of Mexico
Or maybe the coast of Californ
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leavin’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind
[Verse 2]
Oh the weather is against me and the wind blows hard
And the rain she’s a-turnin’ into hail
I still might strike it lucky on a highway going’ west
Though I’m traveling’ on a path beaten trail
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind
[Verse 3]
I will write you a letter from time to time
As I’m rambling’ you can travel with me too
With my head, my heart and my hands, my love
I will send what I learn back home to you
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving’
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind
[Verse 4]
I will tell you of the laughter and of troubles
Be them somebody else’s or my own
With my hands in my pockets and my coat collar high
I will travel unnoticed and unknown
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind
[Verse 5]
I’ve heard tell of a town where I might as well be bound
It’s down around the old Mexican plains
They say that the people are all friendly there
And all they ask of you is your name
So it’s fare thee well my own true love
We’ll meet another day, another time
It ain’t the leaving
That’s a-grievin’ me
But my true love who’s bound to stay behind

[Verse 1]
Farewell
 Angelina, 
the bells on the crown
Are being stolen by bandits, I must follow the 
sound
The triangle tingles, the music plays slow
But farewell Angelina, the night is on fire and I must go
[Verse 2]
There is no use in talking and there's no need for blame
There is nothing to prove, everything still is the same
A table stands empty by the edge of the stream
But farewell Angelina, the sky is changing colors and I must leave
[Verse 3]
The jacks and the queens, they forsake the courtyard
Fifty-two gypsies now file past the guard
In the space where the deuce and the ace once ran wild
Farewell Angelina, the sky is folding, I'll see you after a while
[Verse 4]
See the cross eyed pirates sit perched in the sun
Shooting tin cans with a sawed off shot gun
And the corporals and the neighbors clap and cheer with each blast
But farewell Angelina, the sky is trembling and I must leave fast
[Verse 5]
King Kong, little elves, on the roof-tops they dance
Valentino-type tangos while the heroes clean hands
Shut the eyes of the dead, not to embarrass anyone
Farewell Angelina, the sky is flooding over and I must be gone
[Verse 6]
The camouflaged parrot, he flutters from fear
When something he doesn't know about suddenly appears
What cannot be imitated perfect must die
Farewell Angelina, the sky is flooding over and I must go where it is dry
[Verse 7]
Machine guns are roaring, the puppets heave rocks
At misunderstood visions and at the faces of clocks
Call me any name you like, I will never deny it
But farewell Angelina, the sky is erupting and I must go where it is quiet

[Verse 1]
May God bless and keep you always
May your wishes all come true
May you always do for others
And let others do for you
May you build a ladder to the stars
And climb on every rung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young
[Verse 2]
May you grow up to be righteous
May you grow up to be true
May you always know the truth
And see the lights surrounding you
May you always be courageous
Stand upright and be strong
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever 
young
May you stay forever young
[Verse 3]
May your hands always be busy
May your feet always be swift
May you have a strong foundation
When the winds of changes shift
May your heart always be joyful
May your song always be sung
May you stay forever young
Forever young, forever young
May you stay forever young

[Verse 1]
I got t
his graveyard woman, you know they keep the kids
But my soulful mommy, you know she keeps me hid
She’s a junkyard angel and she always gives me bread
Well, if I go down dying, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed
[Verse 2]
Well, when a pipeline gets lost, you know by the river bridge
And I’m all cracked up by the water’s edge
She comes running down the thruway with 
her dynamite and her thread
Well, if I go down dying, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed
[Verse 3]
Well, she don’t make me nervous, she don’t talk too much
She walks like Bo Diddley and she don’t need no crutch
She keeps a 
four-ten loaded on her with her lead
Well, if I go down dying, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed
[Verse 4]
Well, you don't need a steam shovel to keep away the dead
I need a dump truck mama to unload my head
She brings me everything I want, besides like I said
Well, if I go down dying, you know she bound to put a blanket on my bed

[Verse 1]
Of war and peace the truth just twists
Its curfew gull just glides
Upon four-legged forest clouds
The cowboy angel rides
With his candle lit into the sun
Though its glow is waxed in black
All except when beneath the trees of Eden
[Verse 2]
The lamppost stands with folded arms
Its iron claws attached
To curbs beneath holes where babies wail
Though it shadows metal badge
All and all can only fall
With a crashing but meaningless blow
No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden
[Verse 3]
The savage soldiers sticks his head in sand
And then complains
Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf
But still remains
Upon the beach where hound dogs bay
At ships with tattooed sails
Heading for the Gates of Eden
[Verse 4]
With a time-rusted 
compass blade
Aladdin and his lamp
Sits with Utopian hermit monks
Side saddle on the 
Golden Calf
And on their promises of paradise
You will not hear a laugh
All except inside the Gates of Eden
[Verse 5]
Relationships of ownership
They whisper in the wings
To those condemned to act accordingly
And wait for succeeding kings
And I will try to harmonize with songs
The lonesome sparrow sings
There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden
[Verse 6]
The motorcycle black Madonna
Two-wheeled gypsy queen
And her silver-studded phantom cause
The gray flannel dwarf to scream
As he weeps to wicked birds of prey
Who pick up on his bread crumb sins
And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden
[Verse 7]
The kingdoms of experience
In the precious wind they rot
While paupers change possessions
Each one wishing for what the other has got
And the princess and the prince
Discuss what's real and what is not
It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden
[Verse 8]
The foreign sun, it squints upon
A bed that is never mine
As friends and other strangers
From their fates try to resign
Leaving men wholly totally free
To do anything they wish to do but die
And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden
[Verse 9]
At dawn my lover comes to me
And tells me of her dreams
With no attempts to shovel the glimpse
Into the ditch of what each one means
At times I think there are no words
But these to tell what's true
And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden

[Verse 1]
Well, if you’re traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine
[Verse 2]
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm
When the rivers freeze and summer ends
Please see if she’s wearing a coat so warm
To keep her from the howling winds
[Verse 3]
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
If it rolls and flows all down her breast
Please see for me if her hair hangs long
That’s the way I remember her best
[Verse 4]
I’m a-wondering if she remembers me at all
Many times I’ve often prayed
In the darkness of my night
In the brightness of my day
[Verse 5]
So if you’re traveling in the north country fair
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

[Verse 1]
You may be an ambassador to England or France
You may like to gamble, you might like to dance
You may be the heavyweight champion of the world
You may be a socialite with a long string of pearls
[Chorus]
But you’re going to have to serve somebody, yes indeed
You’re going to have to serve somebody
Well, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord
But you’re going to have to serve somebody
[Verse 2]
You might be a rock ’n’ roll addict prancing on the stage
You might have drugs at your command, women in a cage
You may be a business man or some high-degree thief
They may call you Doctor or they may call you Chief
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
You may be a state trooper, you might be a young Turk
You may be the head of some big TV network
You may be rich or poor, you may be blind or lame
You may be living in another country under another name
[Chorus]
You may be a construction worker working on a home
You may be living in a mansion or you might live in a dome
You might own guns and you might even own tanks
You might be somebody’s landlord, you might even own banks
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
You may be a preacher with your spiritual pride
You may be a city councilman taking bribes on the side
You may be working in a barbershop, you may know how to cut hair
You may be somebody’s mistress, may be somebody’s heir
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Might like to wear cotton, might like to wear silk
Might like to drink whiskey, might like to drink milk
You might like to eat caviar, you might like to eat bread
You may be sleeping on the floor, sleeping in a king-sized bed
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
You may call me Terry, you may call me Timmy
You may call me Bobby, you may call me Zimmy
You may call me R.J., you may call me Ray
You may call me anything but no matter what you say
[Chorus]

Been beat up and battered around
Been sent up
, 
and I've been shot down
You're the best thing that I've ever found
Handle me with care
Reputation's changeable
Situation's tolerable
But baby, you're adorable
Handle me with care
[Pre-Chorus- Roy Orbison]
I'm so tired of being lonely
I still have some love to give
Won't you show me that you really care?
[Chorus- Bob Dylan and Tom Petty]
Everybody's got somebody to lean on
Put your body next to mine, and dream on
I've been fobbed off, and I've been fooled
I've been robbed and ridiculed
In day care centres and night schools
Handle me with care
Been stuck in airports, terrorized
Sent to meetings, hypnotized
Overexposed, commercialized
Handle me with care
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus- Jeff Lynne and Roy Orbison]
I've been uptight and made a mess
But I'll clean it up myself, I guess
Oh, the sweet smell of success
Handle me with care

[Verse 1]
He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I think about him now
Lord I just can't keep from crying
Cause he was a friend of mine
[Verse 2]
He died on the road
He died on the road
He never had enough money
To pay his room or board
And he was a friend of mine
[Verse 3]
I stole away and cried
I stole away and cried
Cause I never had too much money
And I never been quite satisfied
And he was a friend of mine
[Verse 4]
He never done no wrong
He never done no wrong
A thousand miles from home
And he never harmed no one
And he was a friend of mine
[Verse 5]
He was a friend of mine
He was a friend of mine
Every time I hear his name
Lord I just can't keep from crying
Cause he was a friend of mine

[Verse 1]
Oh God said to Abraham, “Kill me a son”
Abe says, “Man, you must be putting me on”
God say, “No.” Abe say, “What?”
God say, “You can do what you want Abe, but
The next time you see me coming you better run”
Well Abe says, “Where do you want this killing done?”
God says, “Out on Highway 61”
[Verse 2]
Well 
Georgia Sam
 he had a bloody nose
Welfare Department they wouldn’t give him no clothes
He asked poor Howard where can I go
Howard said there’s only one place I know
Sam said tell me quick man I got to run
Old Howard just pointed with his gun
And said that way down on Highway 61
[Verse 3]
Well Mack the Finger said to 
Louie the King
I got forty red, white and blue shoestrings
And a thousand telephones that don’t ring
Do you know where I can get rid of these things
And Louie the King said let me think for a minute son
And he said yes I think it can be easily done
Just take everything down to Highway 61
[Verse 4]
Now the fifth daughter on the 
twelfth night
Told the first father that things weren’t right
My complexion she said is much too white
He said come here and step into the light, he says hmm you’re right
Let me tell the second mother this has been done
But the second mother was with
 
the seventh son
And they were both out on Highway 61
[Verse 5]
Now the roving gambler he was very bored
He was trying to create a next world war
He found a promoter who nearly fell off the floor
He said I never engaged in this kind of thing before
But yes I think it can be very easily done
We’ll just put some bleachers out in the sun
And have it on Highway 61

[Verse 1]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I will do anything with you
Well, I’m a-walking down the road
With my head in my hand
I’m looking for a woman
Needs a worried man
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
Low me just-a one more chance
[Verse 2]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your aeroplane
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To ride your passenger train
Well, I’ve been looking all over
For a girl like you
I can’t find nobody
So you’ll have to do
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
Low me just-a one more chance
[Verse 3]
Honey, just allow me one more chance
To get along with you
Honey, just allow me one more chance
I will do anything with you
Well, looking for a woman
That is got no man
Is just looking for a needle
That is lost in the sand
Just-a one kind favor I ask you
Low me just-a one more chance

[Verse 1]
Pistol shots ring out in the barroom night
Enter Patty Valentine from the upper hall
She sees the bartender in a pool of blood
Cries out, “My God, they killed them all!”
Here comes the story of 
the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
[Verse 2]
Three bodies lying there does Patty see
And another man named Bello, moving around mysteriously
“I didn’t do it,” he says, and he throws up his hands
“I was only robbing the register, I hope you understand
I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops
“One of us had better call up the cops”
And so Patty calls the cops
And they arrive on the scene with their red lights flashing
In the hot New Jersey night
[Verse 3]
Meanwhile, far away in another part of town
Rubin Carter
 and a couple of friends are driving around
Number one contender for the middleweight crown
Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down
When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road
Just like the time before and the time before that
In Paterson
 
that’s just the way things go
If you’re black you might as well not show up on the street
Unless you want to draw the heat
[Verse 4]
Alfred Bello
 
had a partner
 
and he had a rap for the cops
Him and 
Arthur Dexter Bradley
 were just out prowling around
He said, “I saw two men running out, they looked like middleweights
They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”
And 
Miss Patty Valentine
 
just nodded her head
Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”
So they took him to the infirmary
And though this man could hardly see
They told him that he could identify the guilty men
[Verse 5]
Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in
Take him to the hospital and they bring him upstairs
The wounded man looks up through his one dying eye
Says, “Why did you bring him in here for? He is not the guy!”
Yes, here’s the story of the Hurricane
The man the authorities came to blame
For something that he never done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world
[Verse 6]
Four months later,
 the ghettos are in flame
Rubin’s in South America, fighting for his name
While Arthur Dexter Bradley’s still in the robbery game
And the cops are putting the screws to him, looking for somebody to blame
“Remember that murder that happened in a bar?”
“Remember you said you saw the getaway car?”
“You think you’d like to play ball with the law?”
“Think it might-a been that fighter that you saw running that night?”
“Don’t forget that you are white”
[Verse 7]
Arthur Dexter Bradley said, “I’m really not sure”
Cops said, “A poor boy like you could use a break
We got you for the motel job and we’re talking to your friend Bello
Now you don’t want to have to go back to jail, 
be a nice fellow
You’ll be doing society a favor
That sonofabitch is brave and getting braver
We want to put his ass in stir
We want to pin this triple murder on him
He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”
[Verse 8]
Rubin could take a man out with just one punch
But he never did like to talk about it all that much
It’s my work, he’d say, and I do it for pay
And when it’s over I’d just as soon go on my way
Up to some paradise
Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice
And ride a horse along a trail
But then they took him to the jailhouse
Where they try to turn a man into a mouse
[Verse 9]
All of Rubin’s cards were marked in advance
The trial was a pig-circus, he never had a chance
The judge made Rubin’s witnesses drunkards from the slums
To the white folks who watched he was a revolutionary bum
And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigger
No one doubted that he pulled the trigger
And though they could not produce the gun
The D.A. said he was the one who did the deed
And the all-white jury agreed
[Verse 10]
Rubin Carter
 was falsely tried
The crime was murder “one,” guess who testified?
Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied
And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride
How can the life of such a man
Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?
To see him obviously framed
Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed to live in a land
Where justice is a game
[Verse 11]
Now all the criminals in their coats and their ties
Are free to drink martinis and watch the sun rise
While Rubin sits like Buddha in a ten-foot cell
An innocent man in a living hell
That’s the story of the Hurricane
But it won’t be over till they clear his name
And give him back the time he’s done
Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been
The champion of the world

[Verse 1]
I am a lonesome hobo
Without family or friends
Where another man’s life might begin
That’s exactly where mine ends
I have tried my hand at bribery
Blackmail and deceit
And I’ve served time for everything
’Cept begging on the street
[Verse 2]
Well, once I was rather prosperous
There was nothing I did lack
I had fourteen-karat gold in my mouth
And silk upon my back
But I did not trust my brother
I carried him to blame
Which led me to my fatal doom
To wander off in shame
[Verse 3]
Kind ladies and kind gentlemen
Soon I will be gone
But let me just warn you all
Before I do pass on
Stay free from petty jealousies
Live by no man’s code
And hold your judgment for yourself
Lest you wind up on this road

[Verse 1]
Someone’s got it in for me, they’re planting stories in the press
Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick, but when they will I can only guess
They say I shot a man named Gray and took his wife to Italy
She inherited a million bucks and when she died it came to me
I can’t help it if I’m lucky
[Verse 2]
People see me all the time and they just can’t remember how to act
Their minds are filled with big ideas, images and distorted facts
Even you, yesterday you had to ask me where it was at
I couldn’t believe after all these years, you didn’t know me better than that
Sweet lady
[Verse 3]
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your mouth
Blowing down the backroads heading south
Idiot wind,
 
blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
[Verse 4]
I ran into the fortune-teller, who said beware of lightning that might strike
I haven’t known peace and quiet for so long I can’t remember what it’s like
There’s a lone soldier on the cross, smoke pouring out of a boxcar door
You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done, in the final end he won the wars
After losing every battle
[Verse 5]
I woke up on the roadside, daydreaming about the way things sometimes are
Visions of your chestnut mare
 shoot through my head and are making me see stars
You hurt the ones that I love best and cover up the truth with lies
One day you’ll be in the ditch, flies buzzing around your eyes
Blood on your saddle
[Verse 6]
Idiot wind, blowing through the flowers on your tomb
Blowing through the curtains in your room
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
[Verse 7]
It was gravity which pulled us down and destiny which broke us apart
You tamed the lion in my cage but it just wasn’t enough to change my heart
Now everything’s a little upside down, as a matter of fact the wheels have stopped
What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good, you’ll find out when you reach the top
You’re on the bottom
[Verse 8]
I noticed at the ceremony, your corrupt ways had finally made you blind
I can’t remember your face anymore, your mouth has changed, your eyes
Don’t look into mine
The priest wore black on the seventh day and sat stone-faced while the
Building burned
I waited for you on the running boards, near the cypress trees, while the
Springtime turned
Slowly into Autumn
[Verse 9]
Idiot wind, blowing like a circle around my skull
From 
the Grand Coulee Dam
 to the Capitol
Idiot wind, blowing every time you move your teeth
You’re an idiot, babe
It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe
[Verse 10]
I can’t feel you anymore, I can’t even touch the books you’ve read
Every time I crawl past your door, I been wishing I was somebody else instead
Down the highway, down the tracks, down the road to ecstasy
I followed you beneath the stars, hounded by your memory
And all your raging glory
[Verse 11]
I been double-crossed now for the very last time and now I’m finally free
I kissed goodbye the howling beast on the borderline which separated you from me
You’ll never know the hurt I suffered nor the pain I rise above
And I’ll never know the same about you, your holiness or your kind of love
And it makes me feel so sorry
[Verse 12]
Idiot wind, blowing through the buttons of our coats
Blowing through the letters that we wrote
Idiot wind, blowing through the dust upon our shelves
We’re idiots, babe
It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves

[Verse 1]
I can't understand
She let go of my hand
And left me here facing the wall
I’d sure like to know
Why she did go
But I can't get close to her at all
Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime
She said she would never forget
But now morning’s clear
It’s like I am not here
She just acts like we never have met
[Verse 2]
It’s all new to me
Like some mystery
It could even be like a myth
Yet it’s hard to think of
That she’s the same one
That last night I was with
From darkness, dreams are deserted
Am I still dreaming yet?
I wish she’d unlock
Her voice once and talk
Instead of acting like we never have met
[Verse 3]
If she is not feeling well
Then why don’t she tell
Instead of turning her back to my face?
Without any doubt
She seems too far out
For me to return to her case
Though the night ran swirling and whirling
I remember her whispering yet
But evidently she don’t
And evidently she won’t
She just acts like we never have met
[Verse 4]
If I didn’t have to guess
I’d gladly confess
To anything I might’ve tried
If I was with her too long
Or have done something wrong
I wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run and hide
Though her skirt it swayed as a guitar played
Her mouth was watery and wet
But now something has changed
For she is not the same
She just acts like we never have met
[Verse 5]
I’m leaving today
I’ll be on my way
Of this I can't say very much
But if you want me to
I can be just like you
And pretend that we never have touched
And if anybody asks me
“Is it easy to forget?”
I’ll say, “It’s easily done
You just pick anyone
And pretend that you never have met!”

[Verse 1]
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive as you or me
Tearing through these quarters
In the utmost misery
With a blanket underneath his arm
And a coat of solid gold
Searching for the very souls
Whom already have been sold
[Verse 2]
“Arise, arise,” he cried so loud
In a voice without restraint
“Come out, ye gifted kings and queens
And hear my sad complaint
No martyr is among ye now
Whom you can call your own
So go on your way accordingly
But know you’re not alone”
[Verse 3]
I dreamed I saw St. Augustine
Alive with fiery breath
And I dreamed I was amongst the ones
That put him out to death
Oh, I awoke in anger
So alone and terrified
I put my fingers against the glass
And bowed my head and cried

[Verse 1]
If dogs run free, then why not we
Across the swooping plain?
My ears hear a symphony
Of two mules, trains and rain
The best is always yet to come
That’s what they explain to me
Just do your thing, you’ll be king
If 
dogs run free
[Verse 2]
If dogs run free, why not me
Across the swamp of time?
My mind weaves a symphony
And tapestry of rhyme
Oh, winds which rush my tale to thee
So it may flow and be
To each his own, it’s all unknown
If dogs run free
[Verse 3]
If dogs run free, then what must be
Must be, and that is all
True love can make a blade of grass
Stand up straight and tall
In harmony with the cosmic sea
True love needs no company
It can cure the soul, it can make it whole
If dogs run free

[Verse 1]
If you see her, say hello, she might be in Tangier
She left here last early Spring, is livin' there, I hear
Say for me that I’m all right though things get kind of slow
She might think that I’ve forgotten her, don’t tell her it isn’t so
[Verse 2]
We had a falling-out, like lovers often will
And to think of how she left that night, it still brings me a chill
And though our separation, it pierced me to the heart
She still lives inside of me, we've never been apart
[Verse 3]
If you get close to her, kiss her once for me
I always have respected her for doing what she did and getting free
Oh, whatever makes her happy, I won't stand in the way
Though the bitter taste still lingers on from the night I tried to make her stay
[Verse 4]
I see a lot of people as I make the rounds
And I hear her name here and there as I go from town to town
And I’ve never gotten used to it, I’ve just learned to turn it off
Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm getting' soft
[Verse 5]
Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past
I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast
If she’s passin’ back this way, I'm not that hard to find
Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time

[Verse 1]
You will search, babe
At any cost
But how long, babe
Can you search for what’s not lost?
Everybody will help you
Some people are very kind
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I’ll keep it with mine
[Verse 2]
I can’t help it
If you might think I’m odd
If I say I’m not loving you for what you are
But for what you’re not
Everybody will help you
Discover what you set out to find
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I’ll keep it with mine
[Verse 3]
The train leaves
At half past ten
But it’ll be back tomorrow
Same time again
The conductor he’s weary
He’s still stuck on the line
But if I can save you any time
Come on, give it to me
I’ll keep it with mine

[Verse 1]
Well, I took me a woman late last night
I’s three-fourths drunk, she looked uptight
She took off her wheel, took off her bell
Took off her wig, said, “How do I smell?"
I hot-footed it bare-naked
Out the window!
[Verse 2]
Well, sometimes I might get drunk
Walk like a duck and stomp like a skunk
Don’t hurt me none, don’t hurt my pride
Because I got my little lady right by my side
(Right there
Proud as can be)
[Verse 3]
I’s out there painting on the old woodshed
When a can a black paint it fell on my head
I went down to scrub and rub
But I had to sit in back of the tub
(Cost a quarter
And I had to get out quick
Someone wanted to come in and take a sauna)
[Verse 4]
Well, my telephone rang it would not stop
It’s President Kennedy calling me up
He said, “My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?”
I said, “My friend, John, Brigitte Bardot
Anita Ekberg
Sophia Loren”
(Put them all in the same room with Ernest Borgnine!)
[Verse 5]
Well, I got a woman sleeps on a cot
She yells and hollers and squeals a lot
Licks my face and tickles my ear
Bends me over and buys me beer
(She’s a honeymooner
A June crooner
A spoon feeder
And a natural leader)
[Verse 6]
Oh, there is no use in me working so heavy
I got a woman who works on the levee
Pumping that water up to her neck
Every week she sends me a monthly check
(She’s a humdinger
Folk singer
Dead ringer
For a thing-a-hum jigger)
[Verse 7]
Late one day in the middle of the week
Eyes were closed I was half asleep
I chased me a woman up the hill
Right in the middle of an air-raid drill
It was Little Bo Peep!
(I jumped a fallout shelter
I jumped a bean stalk
I jumped a Ferris wheel)
[Verse 8]
Now, the man on the stand he wants my vote
He’s a-running for office on the ballot note
He’s out there preaching in front of the steeple
Telling me he loves all kinds-a people
(He’s eating bagels
He’s eating pizza
He’s eating chitlins
He’s eating bullshit!)
[Verse 9]
Oh, set me down on a television floor
I’ll flip the channel to number four
Out of the shower comes a grown-up man
With a bottle of hair oil in his hand
(It’s that greasy kid stuff
What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is
What do you do about Willy Mays and Yul Brynner
Charles de Gaulle
And Robert Louis Stevenson?)
[Verse 10]
Well, the funniest woman I ever seen
Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean
She takes about fifteen baths a day
Wants me to grow a cigar on my face
(She’s a little bit heavy!)
[Verse 11]
Well, ask me why I’m drunk all the time
It levels my head and eases my mind
I just walk along and stroll and sing
I see better days and I do better things
(I catch dinosaurs
I make love to Elizabeth Taylor
Catch hell from Richard Burton!
)

[Verse 1]
I’m just average, common too
I’m just like him, the same as you
I’m everybody’s brother and son
I am not different from anyone
It is no use a-talking to me
It’s just the same as talking to you
[Verse 2]
I was shadow boxing earlier in the day
I figured I was ready for 
Cassius Clay
I said “Fee, fie, fo, fum, Cassius Clay, here I come
26, 27, 28, 29, I’m going to make your face look just like mine
Five, four, three, two, one, Cassius Clay you’d better run
99, 100, 101, 102, your ma won’t even recognize you
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, going to knock him clean right out of his spleen”
[Verse 3]
Well, I don’t know, but I’ve been told
The streets in heaven are lined with gold
I ask you how things could get much worse
If the Russians happen to get up there first
Wowee! pretty scary!
[Verse 4]
Now, I’m liberal, but to a degree
I want everybody to be free
But if you think that I’ll let Barry Goldwater
Move in next door and marry my daughter
You must think I’m crazy!
I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba
[Verse 5]
Well, I set my monkey on the log
And ordered him to do the Dog
He wagged his tail and shook his head
And he went and did the Cat instead
He’s a weird monkey, very funky
[Verse 6]
I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on
Waiting to play tennis in the noonday sun
I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist
And my wig-hat was falling in my face
But they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court
[Verse 7]
I got a woman, she’s so mean
She sticks my boots in the washing machine
Sticks me with buckshot when I’m nude
Puts bubblegum in my food
She’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”
[Verse 8]
Now I got a friend who spends his life
Stabbing my picture with a bowie knife
Dreams of strangling me with a scarf
When my name comes up he pretends to barf
I’ve got a million friends!
[Verse 9]
Now they asked me to read a poem
At the sorority sisters home
I got knocked down and my head was swimming
I wound up with the Dean of Women
Yippee! I’m a poet, and I know it
Hope I don’t blow it
[Verse 10]
I’m going to grow my hair down to my feet so strange
So I look like a walking mountain range
And I’m going to ride into Omaha on a horse
Out to the country club and the golf course
Carry The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds
[Verse 11]
Now you’re probably wondering by now
Just what this song is all about
What’s probably got you baffled more
Is what this thing here is for
It’s nothing
It’s something I learned over in England

[Verse 1]
They say everything can be replaced
Yet every distance
 is not 
near
So I remember every face
Of every man
 
who put me here
[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
[Verse 2]
They say every man needs protection
They say every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Some place so high above this wall
[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
[Verse 3]
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd
Is a man who swears he’s not to blame
All day long I hear him shout so loud
Crying out that he was framed
[Chorus]
I see my light come shining
From the west unto the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released
 

[Verse 1]
I married Isis on the fifth day of May
But I could not hold on to her very long
So I cut off my hair and I rode straight away
For the wild unknown country where I could not go wrong
[Verse 2]
I came to a high place of darkness and light
The dividing line ran through the center of town
I hitched up my pony to a post on the right
Went in to a laundry to wash my clothes down
[Verse 3]
A man in the corner approached me for a match
I knew right away he was not ordinary
He said, “Are you looking for something easy to catch?”
I said, “I got no money.” He said, “That is not necessary”
[Verse 4]
We set out that night for the cold in the North
I gave him my blanket, he gave me his word
I said, “Where are we going?” He said we’d be back by the fourth
I said, “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”
[Verse 5]
I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold
I was thinking about diamonds and the world’s biggest necklace
As we rode through the canyons, through the devilish cold
I was thinking about Isis, how she thought I was so reckless
[Verse 6]
How she told me that one day we would meet up again
And things would be different the next time we wed
If I only could hang on and just be her friend
I still can’t remember all the best things she said
[Verse 7]
We came to the pyramids all embedded in ice
He said, “There’s a body I’m trying to find
If I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”
It was then that I knew what he had on his mind
[Verse 8]
The wind it was howling and the snow was outrageous
We chopped through the night and we chopped through the dawn
When he died I was hoping that it wasn’t contagious
But I made up my mind that I had to go on
[Verse 9]
I broke into the tomb, but the casket was empty
There was no jewels, no nothing, I felt I’d been had
When I saw that my partner was just being friendly
When I took up his offer I must-a been mad
[Verse 10]
I picked up his body and I dragged him inside
Threw him down in the hole and I put back the cover
I said a quick prayer and I felt satisfied
Then I rode back to find Isis just to tell her I love her
[Verse 11]
She was there in the meadow where the creek used to rise
Blinded by sleep and in need of a bed
I came in from the East with the sun in my eyes
I cursed her one time then I rode on ahead
[Verse 12]
She said, “Where you been?” I said, “No place special”
She said, “You look different.” I said, “
Well, not quite
”
She said, “You been gone.” I said, “That’s only natural”
She said, “You going to stay?” I said, “
Yeah, I guess might
”
[Verse 13]
Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child
What drives me to you is what drives me insane
I still can remember the way that you smiled
On the fifth day of May in the drizzling rain

[Verse 1]
Do you love me, or are you just extending goodwill?
Do you need me half as bad as you say, or are you just feeling guilt?
I’ve been burned before and I know the score
So you won’t hear me complain
Will I be able to count on you
Or is your love in vain?
[Verse 2]
Are you so fast that you cannot see that I must have solitude?
When I am in the darkness, why do you intrude?
Do you know my world, do you know my kind
Or must I explain?
Will you let me be myself
Or is your love in vain?
[Verse 3]
Well I’ve been to the mountain and I’ve been in the wind
I’ve been in and out of happiness
I have dined with kings, I’ve been offered wings
And I’ve never been too impressed
[Verse 4]
All right, I’ll take a chance, I will fall in love with you
If I’m a fool you can have the night, you can have the morning too
Can you cook and sew, make flowers grow
Do you understand my pain?
Are you willing to risk it all
Or is your love in vain?

[Verse 1]
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'm not the one you need
You say you're looking for someone
Who's never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
[Chorus]
But it isn't me, babe
No, no, no, it isn't me, babe
It isn't me you're looking for, babe
[Verse 2]
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I'm not the one you want, babe
I'll only let you down
You say you're looking for someone
Who'll promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes to you
Someone to close his heart
Someone to die for you and more
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
You say you're looking for someone
To pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
And will love you for your life
And nothing more
[Chorus]

[Chorus 1: George Harrison]
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
Well it's all right, doing the best you can
Well it's all right, as long as you lend a hand
[Verse 1: Tom Petty]
You can sit around and wait for the phone to ring
Waiting for someone to tell you everything
Sit around and wonder what tomorrow will bring
Maybe a diamond ring
[Chorus 2: Jeff Lynne]
Well it's all right, even if they say you're wrong
Well it's all right, sometimes you gotta be strong
Well it's all right, as long as you got somewhere to lay
Well it's all right, everyday is Judgement Day
[Verse 2: Tom Petty]
Maybe somewhere down the road away
You'll think of me, and wonder where I am these days
Maybe somewhere down the road when somebody plays
Purple haze
[Chorus 3: Roy Orbison]
Well it's all right, even when push comes to shove
Well it's all right, if you got someone to love
Well it's all right, everything'll work out fine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line
[Verse 3: Tom Petty]
Don't have to be ashamed of the car I drive
I'm just glad to be here, happy to be alive
It don't matter if you're by my side
I'm satisfied
[Chorus 4: George Harrison]
Well it's all right, even if you're old and grey
Well it's all right, you still got something to say
[Jeff Lynne]
Well it's all right, remember to live and let live
Well it's all right, the best you can do is forgive
Well it's all right, riding around in the breeze
Well it's all right, if you live the life you please
[George Harrison]
Well it's all right, even if the sun don't shine
Well it's all right, we're going to the end of the line

[Verse 1]
I once held her in my arms
She said she would always stay
But I was cruel
I treated her like a fool
I threw it all away
[Verse 2]
Once I had mountains in the palm of my hand
And rivers that ran through ev’ry day
I must have been mad
I never knew what I had
Until I threw it all away
[Verse 3]
Love is all there is, it makes the world go ’round
Love and only love, it can’t be denied
No matter what you think about it
You just won’t be able to do without it
Take a tip from one who’s tried
[Verse 4]
So if you find someone that gives you all of her love
Take it to your heart, don’t let it stray
For one thing that’s certain
You will surely be a-hurtin
If you throw it all away

[Verse 1]
You must leave now, take what you need, you think will last
But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast
Yonder stands your orphan with his gun
Crying like a fire in the sun
Look out the saints are coming through
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
[Verse 2]
The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense
Take what you have gathered from coincidence
The empty handed painter from your streets
Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets
This sky, too, is folding under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
[Verse 3]
All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home
Your empty handed armies, are all going home
Your lover who just walked out the door
Has taken all his blankets from the floor
The carpet, too, is moving under you
And it's all over now, Baby Blue
[Verse 4]
Leave your stepping stones behind, something calls for you
Forget the dead you've left, they will not follow you
The vagabond who's rapping at your door
Is standing in the clothes that you once wore
Strike another match, go start anew
And it's all over now, Baby Blue

[Verse 1]
Darkness at the break of noon
Shadows even the silver spoon
The handmade blade, the child's balloon
Eclipses both the sun and moon
To understand you know too soon
There is no sense in trying
[Verse 2]
Pointed threats, they bluff with scorn
Suicide remarks are torn
From the fools gold mouthpiece
The hollow horn plays wasted words
Proved to warn
That he not busy being born
Is busy dying
[Verse 3]
Temptation's page flies out the door
You follow, find yourself at war
Watch waterfalls of pity roar
You feel to moan but unlike before
You discover
That you'd just be
One more person crying
So don't fear if you hear
A foreign sound to you ear
It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing
[Verse 4]
As some warn victory, some downfall
Private reasons great or small
Can be seen in the eyes of those that call
To make all that should be killed to crawl
While others say don't hate nothing at all
Except hatred
[Verse 5]
Disillusioned words like bullets bark
As human gods aim for their marks
Make everything from toy guns that sparks
To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark
It's easy to see without looking too far
That not much
Is really sacred
[Verse 6]
While preachers preach of evil fates
Teachers teach that knowledge waits
Can lead to hundred-dollar plates
Goodness hides behind its gates
But even the President of the United States
Sometimes must have
To stand naked
An' though the rules of the road have been lodged
It's only people's games that you got to dodge
And it's alright, Ma, I can make it
[Verse 7]
Advertising signs that con you
Into thinking you're the one
That can do what's never been done
That can win what's never been won
Meantime life outside goes on
All around you
[Verse 8]
You lose yourself, you reappear
You suddenly find you got nothing to fear
Alone you stand without nobody near
When a trembling distant voice, unclear
Startles your sleeping ears to hear
That somebody thinks
They really found you
[Verse 9]
A question in your nerves is lit
Yet you know there is no answer fit to satisfy
Insure you not to quit
To keep it in your mind and not forget
That it is not he or she or them or it
That you belong to
Although the masters make the rules
For the wise men and the fools
I got nothing, Ma, to live up to
[Verse 10]
For them that must obey authority
That they do not respect in any degree
Who despise their jobs, their destinies
Speak jealously of them that are free
Cultivate their flowers to be
Nothing more than something
They invest in
[Verse 11]
While some on principles baptized
To strict party platforms ties
Social clubs in drag disguise
Outsiders they can freely criticize
Tell nothing except who to idolize
And then say "God bless him"
[Verse 12]
While one who sings with his tongue on fire
Gargles in the rat race choir
Bent out of shape from society's pliers
Cares not to come up any higher
But rather get you down in the hole
That he's in
But I mean no harm nor put fault
On anyone that lives in a vault
But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him
[Verse 13]
Old lady judges, watch people in pairs
Limited in sex, they dare
To push fake morals, insult and stare
While money doesn't talk, it swears
Obscenity,
 
who really cares
Propaganda, all is phony
[Verse 14]
While them that defend what they cannot see
With a killer's pride, security
It blows the minds most bitterly
For them that think death's honesty
Won't fall upon them naturally
Life sometimes
Must get lonely
[Verse 15]
My eyes collide head-on with stuffed graveyards
False gods, I scuff
At pettiness which plays so rough
Walk upside-down inside handcuffs
Kick my legs to crash it off
Say okay, I have had enough
What else can you show me?
And if my thought-dreams could be seen
They'd probably put my head in a guillotine
But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only

[Verse 1]
Well, I ride on a mail train, baby
Can’t buy a thrill
Well, I’ve been up all night, baby
Leaning on the windowsill
Well, if I die
On top of the hill
And if I don’t make it
You know my baby will
[Verse 2]
Don’t the moon look good, mama
Shining through the trees?
Don’t the brakeman look good, mama
Flagging down the “Double E?”
Don’t the sun look good
Going down over the sea?
Don’t my gal look fine
When she’s coming after me?
[Verse 3]
Now the wintertime is coming
The windows are filled with frost
I went to tell everybody
But I could not get across
Well, I want to be your lover, baby
I don’t want to be your boss
Don’t say I never warned you
When your train gets lost

[Verse 1]
The guilty undertaker sighs
The lonesome organ grinder cries
The silver saxophones say I should refuse you
The cracked bells and washed-out horns
Blow into my face with scorn
But it’s not that way
I wasn’t born to lose you
[Chorus]
I want you, I want you
I want you so bad
Honey, I want you
[Verse 2]
The drunken politician leaps
Upon the street where mothers weep
And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you
And I wait for them to interrupt
Me drinking from my broken cup
And ask me to
Open up the gate for you
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
How all my fathers, they’ve gone down
True love they’ve been without it
But all their daughters put me down
Because I don’t think about it
[Verse 4]
Well, I return to the Queen of Spades
And talk with my chambermaid
She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her
She is good to me
And there’s nothing she doesn’t see
She knows where I’d like to be
But it doesn’t matter
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit
He spoke to me, I took his flute
No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?
But I did it, though, because he lied
Because he took you for a ride
And because time was on his side
And because I
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
John Wesley Harding
Was a friend to the poor
He traveled with a gun in ev’ry hand
All along this countryside
He opened many a door
But he was never known
To hurt an honest man
[Verse 2]
’Twas down in Chaynee County
A time they talk about
With his lady by his side
He took a stand
And soon the situation there
Was all but straightened out
For he was always known
To lend a helping hand
[Verse 3]
All across the telegraph
His name it did resound
But no charge held against him
Could they prove
And there was no man around
Who could track or chain him down
He was never known
To make a foolish move

[Verse 1]
Standing on the waters
 
casting your bread
While the eyes of the idol with the iron head are glowing
Distant ships sailing into the mist
You
 were 
born with a snake in both of your fists while a hurricane was blowing
Freedom just around the corner for you
But with the truth so far off, what good will it do?
[Chorus]
Jokerman dance to the nightingale tune
Bird fly high by the light of the moon
Oh, oh, oh, Jokerman
[Verse 2]
So swiftly the sun sets in the sky
You rise up and say goodbye to no one
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Both of their futures, so full of dread, you don’t show one
Shedding off one more layer of skin
Keeping one step ahead of the persecutor within
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
You’re a man of the mountains
, you can walk on the clouds
Manipulator of crowds, you’re a dream twister
You’re going to Sodom and Gomorrah
But what do you care? Is nobody there would want to marry your sister
Friend to the martyr, a friend to the 
woman of shame
You look into the fiery furnace, see the rich man without any name
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Well, the Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy
The law of the jungle and the sea are your only teachers
In the smoke of the twilight on a milk-white steed
Michelangelo indeed could’ve carved out your features
Resting in the fields, far from the turbulent space
Half asleep near the stars with a small dog licking your face
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Well, the rifleman’s stalking the sick and the lame
Preacherman seeks the same, who’ll get there first is uncertain
Nightsticks and water cannons, tear gas, padlocks
Molotov cocktails and rocks behind every curtain
False-hearted judges dying in the webs that they spin
Only a matter of time till night comes Stepping in
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
It’s a shadowy world, skies are slippery grey
A woman just gave birth to a prince today and dressed him in scarlet
He’ll put the priest in his pocket, put the blade to the heat
Take the motherless children off the street
And place them at the feet of a harlot
Oh, Jokerman, you know what he wants
Oh, Jokerman, you don’t show any response
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Well you're coming down High Street, walking in the sun
You make the dead man rise, and holler she's the one
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
[Verse 2]
Well it's a long old highway, don't ever end
I've got a Saturday night special, I'm back again
I'll sleep by your door, lay my life on the line
You probably don't know, but I'm going to make you mine
Jolene, Jolene
Baby, I am the king and you're the queen
[Verse 3]
I keep my hands in my pocket, I'm moving along
People think they know, but they're all wrong
You're something nice, I'm going to grab my dice
I can't say I haven't paid the price
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen
[Verse 4]
Well I found out the hard way, I've had my fill
You can't find somebody with his back to a hill
Those big brown eyes, they set off a spark
When you hold me in your arms things don't look so dark
Jolene, Jolene
Baby I am the king and you're the queen

[Verse 1]
Nobody feels any pain
Tonight
 as 
I stand inside the rain
Everybody knows
That Baby’s got new clothes
But lately
 
I see
 
her ribbons and her bows
Have fallen from her curls
She takes 
just like a woman
, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
[Verse 2]
Queen Mary
, 
she’s my friend
Yes, I believe I’ll go see her again
Nobody has to guess
That Baby can’t be blessed
Till she sees finally that she’s like all the rest
With her fog,
 
her amphetamine
 
and her pearls
She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
[Middle Eight]
It was raining from the first
And I was dying here of thirst
So I came in here
And your long-time curse hurts
But what’s worse
Is this pain in here
I can’t stay in here
Ain’t it clear that
[Verse 4]
I just can’t fit
Yes, I believe it’s time for us to quit
When we meet again
Introduced as friends
Please don’t let on that you knew me when
I was hungry and it was your world
Ah, you fake just like a woman, yes, you do
You make love just like a woman, yes, you do
Then you ache just like a woman
But you break just like a little girl
{Instrumental}

[Verse 1]
When you're lost in the rain in Juarez
And it's Eastertime too
And your gravity fails
And negativity don't pull you through
Don't put on any airs
When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue
They got some hungry women there
And they really make a mess outa you
[Verse 2]
Now if you see Saint Annie
Please tell her thanks a lot
I cannot move
My fingers are all in a knot
I don't have the strength
To get up and take another shot
And my best friend, my doctor
Won't even say what it is I've got
[Verse 3]
Sweet Melinda
The peasants call her the goddess of gloom
She speaks good English
And she invites you up into her room
And you're so kind
And careful not to go to her too soon
And she takes your voice
And leaves you howling at the moon
[Verse 4]
Up on Housing Project Hill
It's either fortune or fame
You must pick up one or the other
Though neither of them are to be what they claim
If you're looking to get silly
You better go back to from where you came
Because the cops don't need you
And man they expect the same
Now all the authorities
They just stand around and boast
How they blackmailed the sergeant-at-arms
Into leaving his post
And picking up Angel who
Just arrived here from the coast
Who looked so fine at first
But left looking just like a ghost
[Verse 5]
I started out on burgundy
But soon hit the harder stuff
Everybody said they'd stand behind me
When the game got rough
But the joke was on me
There was nobody even there to bluff
I'm going back to New York City
I do believe I've had enough

[Verse 1]
Mama, take this badge off of me
I can’t use it anymore
It’s getting dark, too dark 
for me to see
I feel like I’m knocking on heaven’s door
[Chorus]
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
Knock, knock, knocking on heaven’s door
[Verse 2]
Mama, put my guns in the ground
I can’t shoot them anymore
That 
long black cloud
 is coming down
I feel like I’m knocking on heaven’s door
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Whatever colors you have in your mind
I’ll show them to you and you’ll see them shine
[Verse 2]
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Until the break of day, let me see you make him smile
His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean
And you’re the best thing that he’s ever seen
[Verse 3]
Stay, lady, stay, stay with your man awhile
Why wait any longer for the world to begin
You can have your cake and eat it too
Why wait any longer for the one you love
When he’s standing in front of you
[Verse 4]
Lay, lady, lay, lay across my big brass bed
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead
I long to see you in the morning light
I long to reach for you in the night
Stay, lady, stay, stay while the night is still ahead

[Verse 1]
Lenny Bruce is dead
 but his ghost lives on and on
Never did get any Golden Globe award, never made it to Synanon
He was an outlaw, that’s for sure
More of an outlaw than you ever were
Lenny Bruce is gone but his spirit’s livin’ on and on
[Verse 2]
Maybe he had some problems, maybe some things that he couldn’t work out
But he sure was funny and he sure told the truth and he knew what he was talkin’ about
Never robbed any churches nor cut off any babies’ heads
He just took the folks in high places and he shined a light in their beds
He’s on some other shore, he didn’t wanna live anymore
[Verse 3]
Lenny Bruce is dead but he didn’t commit any crime
He just had the insight to rip off the lid before its time
I rode with him in a taxi once
Only for a mile and a half, seemed like it took a couple of months
Lenny Bruce moved on and like the ones that killed him, gone
[Verse 4]
They said that he was sick ’cause he didn’t play by the rules
He just showed the wise men of his day to be nothing more than fools
They stamped him and they labeled him like they do with pants and shirts
He fought a war on a battlefield where every victory hurts
Lenny Bruce was bad, he was the brother that you never had

[Intro]
Well, I see you got your brand new 
leopard-skin pillbox hat
Yes, I see you got your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
Well, you must tell me, baby
How your head feels under something like that
Under your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 1]
Well, you look so pretty in it
Honey, can I jump on it sometime?
Yes, I just want to see
If it’s really that expensive kind
You know it balances on your head
Just like a mattress balances
On a bottle of wine
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 2]
Well, if you want to see the sun rise
Honey, I know where
We’ll go out and see it sometime
We’ll both just sit there and stare
Me with my belt
Wrapped around my head
And you just sitting there
In your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 3]
Well, I asked the doctor if I could see you
It’s bad for your health, he said
Yes, I disobeyed his orders
I came to see you
But I found him there instead
You know, I don’t mind him cheating on me
But I sure wish he’d take that off his head
Your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat
[Verse 4]
Well, I see you got a new boyfriend
You know, I never seen him before
Well, I saw you making love with him
You forgot to close the garage door
You might think he loves you for your money
But I know what he really loves you for
It’s your brand new leopard-skin pillbox hat

[Verse 1]
I bless the day I found you
I want my arms around you
And so I beg you: Let it be me
[Verse 2]
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever, let it be me
[Verse 3]
Each time we meet, love
I find complete love
Without your sweet love, what would life be ?
[Verse 4]
So never leave me lonely
Tell me that you love me only
And say you'll always let it be me

[Verse 1]
Man thinks because he rules the earth he can do with it as he please
And if things don’t change soon, he will
Oh, man has invented his doom
First step was touching the moon
[Verse 2]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?
[Verse 3]
Now, they take him and they teach him and they groom him for life
And they set him on a path where he’s bound to get ill
Then they bury him with stars
Sell his body like they do used cars
[Verse 4]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sits there facing the hill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?
[Verse 5]
Now, he’s hell-bent for destruction, he’s afraid and confused
And his brain has been mismanaged with great skill
All he believes are his eyes
And his eyes, they just tell him lies
[Verse 6]
But there’s a woman on my block
Sitting there in a cold chill
She say who going to take away his license to kill?
[Verse 7]
You may be a noisemaker, spirit maker
Heartbreaker, backbreaker
Leave no stone unturned
May be an actor in a plot
That might be all that you got
Till your error you clearly learn
[Verse 8]
Now he worships at an altar of a stagnant pool
And when he sees his reflection, he’s fulfilled
Oh, man is opposed to fair play
He wants it all and he wants it his way
[Verse 9]
Now, there’s a woman on my block
She just sit there as the night grows still
She say who going to take away his license to kill?

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say, "Beware doll, you're bound to fall,"
You thought they were all a’kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
[Chorus 1]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be without a home?
Like a complete unknown?
Like a rolling stone?
[Verse 2]
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But you know you only used to get juiced in it
And nobody has ever taught you how to live on the street
And now you find out you’re gonna have to get used to it
You said you never compromise
With a mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"
[Chorus 2]
How does it feel?
How does it feel?
To be on your own?
With no direction home?
A complete unknown
Like a rolling stone
[Verse 3]
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns
When they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?
[Chorus 2]
[Verse 4]
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking, thinking that they’ve got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him now, he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you’ve got nothing to lose
You're invisible now, you got no secrets to conceal
[Chorus 2]

[Verse 1]
The festival was over, the boys were all planning for a fall
The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall
The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down
Anyone with any sense had already left town
He was standing in the doorway looking like 
the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 2]
He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said
Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads
Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin
“Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”
Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 3]
Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs
Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair
Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide
A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside
Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 4]
Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine
He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine
With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place
He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste
But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 5]
Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town
She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown
She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear
“Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear
He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 6]
“I know I’ve seen that face before,” Big Jim was thinking to himself
“Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”
But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim
And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him
Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 7]
Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child
She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled
She’d come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs
With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere
But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 8]
The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined
The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind
It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring
And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king
No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 9]
Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife
She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife
She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide
Was looking to do just one good deed before she died
She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 10]
Lily washed her face, took her dress off and buried it away
“Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must
Have known it would someday
Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint
I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”
Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 11]
The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair
“There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”
He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk
As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk
There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 12]
Lily’s arms were locked around the man that she dearly loved to touch
She forgot all about the man she couldn't stand who hounded her so much
“I’ve missed you so,” she said to him, and he felt she was sincere
But just beyond the door he felt jealousy and fear
Just another night in the life of the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 13]
No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick
The door to the dressing room burst open and a cold revolver clicked
And Big Jim was standing there, ya couldn't say surprised
Rosemary right beside him, steady in her eyes
She was with Big Jim but she was leaning to the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 14]
Two doors down the boys finally made it through the wall
And cleaned out the bank safe, it’s said that they got off with quite a haul
In the darkness by the riverbed they waited on the ground
For one more member who had business back in town
But they couldn't go no further without the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 15]
The next day was hanging day, the sky was overcast and black
Big Jim lay covered up, killed by a penknife in the back
And Rosemary on the gallows, she didn't even blink
The hanging judge was sober, he hadn't had a drink
The only person on the scene missing was the Jack of Hearts
[Verse 16]
The cabaret was empty now, a sign said, “Closed for repair”
Lily had already taken all of the dye out of her hair
She was thinking ’bout her father, who she very rarely saw
Thinking ’bout Rosemary and thinking about the law
But most of all she was thinking ’bout the Jack of Hearts

[Verse 1]
It's been such a long long time
Since we loved each other when our hearts were true
One time, for one brief day, I was the man for you
Last night I heard you talking in your sleep
Saying things you shouldn't say, oh baby
You just may have to go to jail someday
[Verse 2]
Is there a place we can go?
Is there anybody we can see?
Maybe it's the same for you as it is for me
I ain't seen my family in twenty years
That ain't easy to understand, they may be dead by now
I lost track of em after they lost their land
[Verse 3]
Shake it up baby, 
twist
 and shout
You know what it's all about
What are you doing out there in the sun anyway?
Don't you know, the sun can burn your brains right out
[Verse 4]
My enemy crashed into the dust
Stopped dead in his tracks and he lost his lust
He was run down hard and he broke apart
He died in shame, he had an iron heart
[Verse 5]
I wear dark glasses to cover my eyes
There are secrets in em that I can't disguise
Come back baby
If I hurt your feelings, I apologize
[Verse 6]
Two trains running side by side, forty miles wide
Down the eastern line
You don't have to go
I just came to you because you're a friend of mine
[Verse 7]
I think that when my back was turned
The whole world behind me burned
It's been a while
Since we walked down that long, long aisle
[Verse 8]
We cried on a cold and frosty morn
We cried because our souls were torn
So much for tears
So much for these long and wasted years

[Verse 1]
My parents raised me tenderly
I was their only son
My mind got mixed with rambling
When I was all so young
And I left my home the first time
When I was twelve and one
I’m a long time a-comin’, Maw
An’ I’ll be a long time gone
[Verse 2]
On the western side of Texas
On the Texas plains
I tried to find a job o’ work
But they said l’s young of age
My eyes they burned when I heard
“Go home where you belong!”
I’m a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone
[Verse 3]
I remember when I’s rambling
Around with the carnival trains
Different towns, different people
Somehow they’re all the same
I remember children’s faces best
I remember traveling on
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone
[Verse 4]
I once loved a fair young maid
An’ I ain’t too big to tell
If she broke my heart a single time
She broke it ten or twelve
I walked and talked all by myself
I did not tell no one
I’m a long time a-comin’, babe
An’ I’ll be a long time gone
[Verse 5]
Many times by the highwayside
I tried to flag a ride
With bloodshot eyes and gritting teeth
I’d watch the cars roll by
The empty air hung in my head
I’s thinkin’ all day long
I’m a long time a-comin’
I’ll be a long time gone
[Verse 6]
You might see me on your crossroads
When I’m a-passin’ through
Remember me how you wished to
As I’m a-Driftin’ from your view
I ain’t got the time to think about it
I got too much to get done
Well, I’m a long time coming
An’ I’ll be a long time gone
[Verse 7]
If I can’t help somebody
With a word or song
If I can’t show somebody
They are traveling’ wrong
But I know I ain’t no prophet
An’ I ain’t no prophet’s son
I’m just a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone
[Verse 8]
So you can have your beauty
It’s skin deep and it only lies
And you can have your youth
It’ll rot before your eyes
Just give to me my gravestone
With it clearly carved upon:
“I’s a long time a-comin’
An’ I’ll be a long time gone”

[Verse 1]
My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire
[Verse 2]
People carry roses
Make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her
[Verse 3]
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall
[Verse 4]
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all
[Verse 5]
The cloak and dagger will dangle
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even a pawn must hold a grudge
Statues made of match sticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge
[Verse 6]
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring
[Verse 7]
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows cold and rainy
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing

[Verse 1]
I am not going to work on Maggie's farm no more
No, I am not going to work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I wake up in the morning
Fold my hands and pray for rain
I got a head full of ideas
That are driving me insane
It's a shame the way she makes me scrub the floor
I am not going to work on Maggie's farm no more
[Verse 2]
I am not going to work for Maggie's brother no more
No, I am not going to work for Maggie's brother no more
Well, he hands you a nickel
He hands you a dime
He asks you with a grin
If you're having a good time
Then he fines you every time you slam the door
I am not going to work for Maggie's brother more
[Verse 3]
I am not going to work for Maggie's pa no more
No, I am not going t work for Maggie's pa no more
Well, he puts his cigar
Out in your face just for kicks
His bedroom window
It is made out of bricks
The National Guard stands around his door
Ah, I am not going to work for Maggie's pa no more
[Verse 4]
I am not going to work for Maggie's ma no more
No, am not going to work for Maggie's ma no more
Well, when she talks to all the servants
About man and God and law
Everybody says
She's the brains behind pa
She's sixty-eight, but she says she's fifty-four
I am not going to work for Maggie's ma no more
[Verse 5]
I am not going to work on Maggie's farm no more
I am not going to work on Maggie's farm no more
Well, I try my best
To be just like I am
But everybody wants you
To be just like them
They say sing while you slave and I just get bored
I am not going to work on Maggie's farm no more

[Verse 1]
Go away from my window
Leave at your own chosen speed
I’m not the one you want, babe
I’m not the one you need
You say you’re looking for someone
Never weak but always strong
To protect you and defend you
Whether you are right or wrong
Someone to open each and every door
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe
[Verse 2]
Go lightly from the ledge, babe
Go lightly on the ground
I’m not the one you want, babe
I will only let you down
You say you’re looking for someone
Who will promise never to part
Someone to close his eyes for you
Someone to close his heart
Someone who will die for you and more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe
[Verse 3]
Go melt back into the night, babe
Everything inside is made of stone
There’s nothing in here moving
And anyway I’m not alone
You say you’re looking for someone
Who’ll pick you up each time you fall
To gather flowers constantly
And to come each time you call
A lover in your life and nothing more
But it ain't me, babe
No, no, no, it ain't me, babe
It ain't me you’re looking for, babe

[Verse 1]
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
[Verse 2]
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
[Verse 3]
I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
But I would never do you 
wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
[Verse 4]
I’d go hungry, I’d go black and blue
I’d go crawling down the avenue
There’s nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love
[Verse 5]
The storms are raging on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You haven't seen nothing like me yet
[Verse 6]
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn’t do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love

[Verse]
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
I won't be next to you you know I won't be near
I'd be curious to know if your reflection is as clear
As the one that I've got on my mind mama you been on my mind
Well perhaps it's the wind and the dark dark night that's covering
The crossroads that I'm at
And maybe it's the weather something like that
But mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind
Well I don't need trouble please don't put me down or get upset
I am not pleading I won't say I'll forget
And I won't pace a floor bout down and bent but yet
Mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind
Even though my mind is hazy and my thoughts are kinda narrow
Where you been don't bother me or bring me down with sorrow
It don't matter to me where you'll be waking up tomorrow
But mama you been on my mind mama you been on my mind

[Chorus]
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, in the beginning
Man gave names to all the animals
In the beginning, long time ago
[Verse 1]
He saw an animal that liked to growl
Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Great big furry back and furry hair
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bear”
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
He saw an animal up on a hill
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
He saw milk coming out but he didn’t know how
“Ah, think I’ll call it a cow”
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
He saw an animal that liked to snort
Horns on his head and they weren’t too short
It looked like there wasn’t nothing that he couldn’t pull
“Ah, think I’ll call it a bull”
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
Real dirty face and a curly tail
He wasn’t too small and he wasn’t too big
“Ah, think I’ll call it a pig”
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Next animal that he did meet
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
“Ah, think I’ll call it a sheep”
[Chorus]
[Outro]
He saw an animal as smooth as glass
Slithering his way through the grass
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake

[Verse 1]
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
[Verse 2]
You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
[Verse 3]
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
[Verse 4]
You fasten the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
[Verse 5]
You’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You are not worth the blood
That runs in your veins
[Verse 5]
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
[Verse 7]
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
[Verse 8]
And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch while you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand on your grave
Till I’m sure that you’re dead

[Verse 1]
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Meet me in the morning, 56th and Wabasha
Honey, we could be in Kansas
By time the snow begins to thaw
[Verse 2]
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
They say the darkest hour is right before the dawn
But you wouldn’t know it by me
Every day’s been darkness since you been gone
[Verse 3]
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Little rooster crowing, there must be something on his mind
Well, I feel just like that rooster
Honey, ya treat me so unkind
[Verse 5]
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, I struggled through barbed wire, felt the hail fall from above
Well, you know I even outran the hound dogs
Honey, you know I’ve earned your love
[Verse 6]
Look at the sun sinking like a ship
Look at the sun sinking like a ship
Ain’t that just like my heart, babe
When you kissed my lips?

[Verse 1]
Every step of the way we walk the line
Your days are numbered, so are mine
Time is piling’ up, we struggle and we scrape
We’re all boxed in, nowhere to escape
[Verse 2]
City’s just a jungle; more games to play
Trapped in the heart of it, trying' to get away
I was raised in the country, I been working’ in the town
I been in trouble ever since I set my suitcase down
[Verse 3]
Got nothing' for you, I had nothing' before
Don’t even have anything for myself anymore
Sky full of fire, pain pouring’ down
Nothing you can sell me, I’ll see you around
[Verse 4]
All my powers of expression and thoughts so sublime
Could never do you justice in reason or rhyme
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
[Verse 5]
Well, the devil’s in the alley, mule’s in the stall
Say anything you wanna, I have heard it all
I was thinking’ 'bout the things that Rosie said
I was dreaming I was sleeping' in Rosie’s bed
[Verse 6]
Walking through the leaves, falling from the trees
Feeling like a stranger nobody sees
So many things that we never will undo
I know you’re sorry, I’m sorry too
[Verse 7]
Some people will offer you their hand and some won’t
Last night I knew you, tonight I don’t
I need something strong to distract my mind
I’m gonna look at you ’til my eyes go blind
[Verse 8]
Well I got here following' the southern star
I crossed that river just to be where you are
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long
[Verse 9]
Well my ship’s been split to splinters and it’s sinking' fast
I’m drowning in the poison, got no future, got no past
But my heart is not weary, it’s light and it’s free
I’ve got nothing but affection for all those who’ve sailed with me
[Verse 10]
Everybody moving if they ain’t already there
Everybody got to move somewhere
Stick with me baby, stick with me anyhow
Things should start to get interesting' right about now
[Verse 11]
My clothes are wet, tight on my skin
Not as tight as the corner that I painted myself in
I know that fortune is waiting’ to be kind
So give me your hand and say you’ll be mine
[Verse 12]
Well, the emptiness is endless, cold as the clay
You can always come back, but you can’t come back all the way
Only one thing I did wrong
Stayed in Mississippi a day too long

[Verse 1]
I've been a moonshiner
For seventeen long years
I've spent all my money
On whiskey and beer
I go to some hollow
And sit at my still
And if whiskey dont kill me
Then I dont know what will
[Verse 2]
I go to some bar room
And drink with my friends
Where the women can't follow
And see what I spend
God bless them pretty women
I wish they was mine
Their breath is as sweet
The dew on the vine
[Verse 3]
Let me eat when I am hungry
Let me drink when I am dry
A dollar when I am hard up
Religion when I die
The whole world's a bottle
And life's but a dram
When the bottle gets empty
It sure ain't worth a damn

[Verse 1]
You say you love me
And you’re thinking of me
But you know you could be wrong
You say you told me
That you want to hold me
But you know you’re not that strong
I just can’t do what I done before
I just can’t beg you anymore
I’m going to let you pass
And I’ll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who’s been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
[Verse 2]
You say you disturb me
And you don’t deserve me
But you know sometimes you lie
You say you’re shaking
And you’re always aching
But you know how hard you try
Sometimes it gets so hard to care
It can’t be this way everywhere
And I’m going to let you pass
Yes, and I’ll go last
Then time will tell just who fell
And who’s been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine
[Verse 3]
The judge, he holds a grudge
He’s going to call on you
But he’s badly built
And he walks on stilts
Watch out he don’t fall on you
[Verse 4]
You say you’re sorry
For telling’ stories
That you know I believe are true
You say ya got some
Other kinda lover
And yes, I believe you do
You say my kisses are not like his
But this time I’m not going to tell you why that is
I’m just going to let you pass
Yes, and I’ll go last
Then time will tell who fell
And who’s been left behind
When you go your way and I go mine

[Verse 1]
Most of the time
I’m clear focused all around
Most of the time
I can keep both feet on the ground
I can follow the path, I can read the signs
Stay right with it when the road unwinds
I can handle whatever I stumble upon
I don’t even notice she’s gone
Most of the time
[Verse 2]
Most of the time
It’s well understood
Most of the time
I wouldn’t change it if I could
I can make it all match up, I can hold my own
I can deal with the situation right down to the bone
I can survive, I can endure
And I don’t even think about her
Most of the time
[Verse 3]
Most of the time
My head is on straight
Most of the time
I’m strong enough not to hate
I don’t build up illusion ’till it makes me sick
I ain’t afraid of confusion no matter how thick
I can smile in the face of mankind
Don’t even remember what her lips felt like on mine
Most of the time
[Verse 4]
Most of the time
She ain’t even in my mind
I wouldn’t know her if I saw her
She’s that far behind
Most of the time
I can’t even be sure
If she was ever with me
Or if I was with her
[Verse 5]
Most of the time
I’m halfway content
Most of the time
I know exactly where it went
I don’t cheat on myself, I don’t run and hide
Hide from the feelings that are buried inside
I don’t compromise and I don’t pretend
I don’t even care if I ever see her again
Most of the time

[Verse 1]
I pounded on a farmhouse
Looking for a place to stay
I was mighty, mighty tired
I had come a long, long way
I said, “Hey, hey, in there
Is there anybody home?”
I was standing on the steps
Feeling most alone
Well, out comes a farmer
He must have thought that I was nuts
He immediately looked at me
And stuck a gun into my guts
[Verse 2]
I fell down
To my bended knees
Saying, “I dig farmers
Don’t shoot me, please!”
He cocked his rifle
And began to shout
“You’re that traveling salesman
That I have heard about”
I said, “No! No! No!
I’m a doctor and it’s true
I’m a clean-cut kid
And I been to college, too”
[Verse 3]
Then in comes his daughter
Whose name was Rita
She looked like she stepped out of
La Dolce Vita
I immediately tried to cool it
With her dad
And told him what a
Nice, pretty farm he had
He said, “What do 
doctors
Know about farms, pray tell?”
I said, 
“I was born
At the bottom of a wishing well”
[Verse 4]
Well, by the dirt beneath my nails
I guess he knew I wouldn’t lie
“I guess you’re tired”
He said, kind of sly
I said, “Yes, ten thousand miles
Today I drove”
He said, “I got a bed for you
Underneath the stove
Just one condition
And you go to sleep right now
That you don’t touch my daughter
And in the morning, milk the cow”
[Verse 5]
I was sleeping like a rat
When I heard something jerkin’
There stood Rita
Looking just like Tony Perkins
She said, “Would you like to take a shower?
I’ll show you up to the door”
I said, “Oh, no! no!
I’ve been through this movie before”
I knew I had to split
But I didn’t know how
When she said
“Would you like to take that shower, now?”
[Verse 6]
Well, I couldn’t leave
Unless the old man chased me out
Because I’d already promised
That I’d milk his cows
I had to say something
To strike him very weird
So I yelled out
“I like Fidel Castro and his beard”
Rita looked offended
But she got out of the way
As he came charging down the stairs
Saying, “What’s that I heard you say?”
[Verse 7]
I said, “I like Fidel Castro
I think you heard me right”
And ducked as he swung
At me with all his might
Rita mumbled something
About her mother on the hill
As his fist hit the icebox
He said he’s going to kill me
If I don’t get out the door
In two seconds flat
“You unpatriotic
Rotten doctor Commie rat”
[Verse 8]
Well, he threw a Reader’s Digest
At my head and I did run
I did a somersault
As I seen him get his gun
And crashed through the window
At a hundred miles an hour
And landed fully blast
In his garden flowers
Rita said, “Come back!”
As he started to load
The sun was coming up
And I was running down the road
[Verse 9]
Well, I don’t figure I’ll be back
There for a spell
Even though Rita moved away
And got a job in a motel
He still waits for me
Constant, on the sly
He wants to turn me in
To the F.B.I
Me, I romp and stomp
Thankful as I romp
Without freedom of speech
I might be in the swamp

[Verse 1]
I like to spend some time in Mozambique
The sunny sky is aqua blue
And all the couples dancing cheek to 
cheek
It’s very nice to stay a week or two
[Verse 2]
There’s lot of pretty girls in Mozambique
And plenty time for good romance
And everybody likes to stop and speak
To give the special one you seek a chance
Or maybe say hello with just a glance
[Verse 3]
Lying next to her by the ocean
Reaching out and touching her hand
Whispering your secret emotion
Magic in a magical land
[Verse 4]
And when it’s time for leaving Mozambique
To say goodbye to sand and sea
You turn around to take a final peek
And you see why it’s so unique to be
Among the lovely people living free
Upon the beach of sunny Mozambique

[Chorus]
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey ! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
[Verse 1]
Though I know that evening's empire has returned into sand
Vanished from my hand
Left me blindly here to stand but still not sleeping
My weariness amazes me, I'm branded on my feet
I have no one to meet
And the ancient empty street's too dead for dreaming
[Chorus]
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
I'm not sleepy and there is no place I'm going to
Hey! Mr Tambourine Man, play a song for me
In the jingle jangle morning I'll come following you
[Verse 2]
Take me on a trip upon your magic swirling ship
My senses have been stripped, my hands can't feel to grip
My toes too numb to step, wait only for my boot heels
To be wandering
I'm ready to go anywhere, I'm ready for to fade
Into my own parade, cast your dancing spell my way
I promise to go under it
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Though you might hear laughing, spinning swinging madly across the sun
It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run
And but for the sky there are no fences facing
And if you hear vague traces of skipping reels of rhyme
To your tambourine in time, it's just a ragged clown behind
I wouldn't pay it any mind, it's just a shadow you're
Seeing that he's chasing
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Then take me disappearing through the smoke rings of my mind
Down the foggy ruins of time, far past the frozen leaves
The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach
Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow
Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free
Silhouetted by the sea,
 circled by the circus sands
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves
Let me forget about today until tomorrow
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Crimson flames tied through my ears
Rolling high and mighty traps
Pounced with fire on flaming roads
Using ideas as my maps
“We’ll meet on edges, soon,” said I
Proud beneath heated brow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
[Verse 2]
Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth
“Rip down all hate,” I screamed
Lies that life is black and white
Spoke from my skull. I dreamed
Romantic facts of musketeers
Foundation ed deep, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
[Verse 3]
Girls’ faces formed the forward path
From phony jealousy
To memorizing politics
Of ancient history
Flung down by corpse evangelists
Un thought of, though, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
[Verse 4]
A self-ordained professor’s tongue
Too serious to fool
Spouted out that liberty
Is just equality in school
“Equality,” I spoke the word
As if a wedding vow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
[Verse 5]
In a soldier’s stance, I aimed my hand
At the mongrel dogs who teach
Fearing not that I’d become my enemy
In the instant that I preach
My existence led by confusion boats
Mutiny from stern to bow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now
[Verse 6]
Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats
Too noble to neglect
Deceived me into thinking
I had something to protect
Good and bad, I define these terms
Quite clear, no doubt, somehow
Ah, but I was so much older then
I’m younger than that now

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna walk across the desert
 
'til I'm in my right mind
I won't even think about what I left behind
Nothing back there anyway that I can call my own
Go back home, leave me alone
It's a long road, 
it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 2]
Ever since the British burned the White House down
There's a bleeding wound in the heart of town
I saw you drinking from an empty cup
I saw you buried and I saw you dug up
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 3]
Look down angel from the skies
Help my weary soul to rise
I kissed her cheek I dragged your plow
You broke my heart, I was your friend 'til now
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 4]
In the courtyard of the golden sun
You stand and fight or you break and run
You went and lost your lovely head
For a drink of wine and a crust of bread
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 5]
We looted and we plundered on distant shores
Why is my share not equal to yours
Your father left you, your mother too
Even death has washed it's hands of you
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 6]
This is hard country to stay alive in
Blades are everywhere and they're breaking my skin
I'm armed to the hilt and I'm struggling hard
You won't get out of here unscarred
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 7]
You got too many lovers waiting at the wall
About a thousand tons, I couldn't count them all
Yesterday I could've thrown them all in the sea
Today, even one, may be too much for me
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 8]
Can't walk them, baby, you could do no wrong
Put your arms around me, where they belong
I won't take you on a roller-coaster ride
Lay my hands all over you, tie you to my side
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 9]
I've got a heavy stacked woman with a smile on her face
And she has crowned my soul with grace
Im still hurting from an arrow that pierced my chest
I'm gonna have to take my head and bury it between your breasts
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 10]
Been dark all night but now it's dawn
The moving finger is moving on
You can guard me while I sleep
Kiss
 
away the tears I weep
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday
[Verse 11]
I love women and she loves men
We've been to the west and we going back again
I heard a voice at the dusk of day
Saying, "Be gentle brother, be gentle and pray."
It's a long road, it's a long and narrow way
If I can't work up to you, you'll surely have to work down to me someday

[Verse 1]
Well, the neighborhood bully, he’s just one man
His enemies say he’s on their land
They got him outnumbered about a million to one
He got no place to escape to, no place to run
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 2]
The neighborhood bully just lives to survive
He’s criticized and condemned for being alive
He’s not supposed to fight back, he’s supposed to have thick skin
He’s supposed to lay down and die when his door is kicked in
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 3]
The neighborhood bully been driven out of every land
He’s wandered the earth an exiled man
Seen his family scattered, his people hounded and torn
He’s always on trial for just being born
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 4]
Well, he knocked out a lynch mob, he was criticized
Old women condemned him, said he should apologize
Then he destroyed a bomb factory
, nobody was glad
The bombs were meant for him. He was supposed to feel bad
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 5]
Well, the chances are against it and the odds are slim
That he’ll live by the rules that the world makes for him
Because there’s a noose at his neck and a gun at his back
And a license to kill him is given out to every maniac
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 6]
He got no allies to really speak of
What he gets he must pay for, he don’t get it out of love
He buys obsolete weapons and he won’t be denied
But no one sends flesh and blood to fight by his side
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 7]
Well, he’s surrounded by pacifists who all want peace
They pray for it nightly that the bloodshed must cease
Now, they wouldn’t hurt a fly. To hurt one they would weep
They lay and they wait for this bully to fall asleep
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 8]
Every empire that’s enslaved him is gone
Egypt and Rome, even the great Babylon
He’s made a garden of paradise in the desert sand
In bed with nobody, under no one’s command
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 9]
Now his holiest books have been trampled upon
No contract he signed was worth what it was written on
He took the crumbs of the world and he turned it into wealth
Took sickness and disease and he turned it into health
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 10]
What’s anybody indebted to him for?
Nothing, they say. 
He just likes to cause war
Pride and prejudice and superstition indeed
They wait for this bully like a dog waits to feed
He’s the neighborhood bully
[Verse 11]
What has he done to wear so many scars?
Does he change the course of rivers? Does he pollute the moon and stars?
Neighborhood bully, standing on the hill
Running out the clock, time standing still
Neighborhood bully

[Verse 1]
Lost John
 
sitting on a railroad track
Something's out of whack
Blues this morning falling down like hail
Gonna leave a greasy trail
[Verse 2]
Gonna travel the world is what I'm gonna do
Then come back and see you
All I ever do is struggle and strive
If I don't do anybody any harm, I might make it back home alive
[Verse 3]
I'm the oldest son of a crazy man
I'm in a cowboy band
Got a pile of sins to pay for and I ain't got time to hide
I'd walk through a blazing fire, baby, if I knew you was on the other side
[Chorus]
Oh, I miss you Nettie Moore
And my happiness is o'er
Winter's gone, the river's on the rise
I loved you then and ever shall
But there's no one here left to tell
The world has gone black before my eyes
[Verse 4]
The world of research has gone berserk
Too much paperwork
Albert's in the graveyard, Frankie's raising hell
I'm beginning to believe what the scriptures tell
[Verse 5]
I'm going where the Southern crosses the Yellow Dog
Get away from these demagogues
And these bad luck women stick like glue
It's either one or the other or neither of the two
[Verse 6]
She says, "look out daddy, don't want you to tear your pants
You can get wrecked in this dance."
They say whiskey will kill ya, but I don't think it will
I'm riding with you to the top of the hill
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
Don't know why my baby never looked so good before
I don't have to wonder no more
She been cooking all day and it's gonna take me all night
I can't eat all that stuff in a single bite
[Verse 8]
The Judge is coming in, everybody rise
Lift up your eyes
You can do what you please, you don't need my advice
Before you call me any dirty names you better think twice
[Verse 9]
Getting light outside, the temperature dropped
I think the rain has stopped
I'm going to make you come to grips with fate
When I'm through with you, you'll learn to keep your business straight
[Chorus]
[Verse 10]
The bright spark of the steady lights
Has dimmed my sights
When you're around all my grief gives 'way
A lifetime with you is like some heavenly day
[Verse 11]
Everything I've ever known to be right has been proven wrong
I'll be drifting along
The woman I'm a-loving, she rules my heart
No knife could ever cut our love apart
[Verse 12]
Today I'll stand in faith and raise
The voice of praise
The sun is strong, I'm standing in the light
I wish to God that it were night
[Chorus]
   

[Verse 1]
Once I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
I had a pony, her name was Lucifer
She broke her leg and she needed shooting
I swear it hurt me more than it could ever have hurted her
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder what’s going on in the mind of Miss X
Sometimes I wonder what’s going on in the mind of Miss X
You know she got such a sweet disposition
I never know what the poor girl’s gonna do to me next
[Verse 3]
I got a new pony
, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
Well, I got a new pony, she knows how to fox-trot, lope and pace
She got great big hind legs
And long black shaggy hair above her face
[Verse 4]
Well now, it was early in the morning’, I have seen your shadow in the door
It was early in the morning’, I seen your shadow in the door
Now, I don’t have to ask nobody
I know what you come here for
[Verse 5]
They say you’re using’ voodoo, your feet walk by themselves
They say you’re using’ voodoo, I seen your feet walk by themselves
Oh, baby, that god you been prayin’ to
Has gonna given you back what you’re wishing’ on someone else
[Verse 6]
Come over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you
Come over here pony, I, I wanna climb up one time on you
Well, you’re so bad and nasty
But I love you, yes I do

[Verse 1]
Come gather around friends
And I'll tell you a tale
Of when the red iron pits ran empty
But the cardboard filled windows
And old men on the benches
Tell you now that the whole town is empty
[Verse 2]
In the north end of town
My own children are grown
But I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth
May mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother
[Verse 3]
The iron ore poured
As the years passed the door
The drag lines and the shovels they was a-humming
Till one day my brother
Failed to come home
The same as my father before him
[Verse 4]
Well a long winter's wait
From the window I watched
My friends they couldn't have been kinder
And my schooling was cut
As I quit in the spring
To marry John Thomas, a miner
[Verse 5]
Oh the years passed again
And the giving was good
With the lunch bucket filled every season
What with three babies born
The work was cut down
To a half a day's shift with no reason
Then the shaft was soon shut
And more work was cut
And the fire in the air, it felt frozen
Till a man come to speak
And he said in one week
That number eleven was closing
[Verse 6]
They complained in the East
They are playing too high
They say that your ore is not worth digging
That it's much cheaper down
In the South American towns
Where the miners work almost for nothing
[Verse 7]
So the mining gates locked
And the red iron rotted
And the room smelled heavy from drinking
Where the sad silent song
Made the hour twice as long
As I waited for the sun to go sinking
[Verse 8]
I lived by the window
As he talked to himself
This silence of tongues it was building
Then one morning's wake
The bed it was bare
And I's left alone with three children
[Verse 9]
The summer is gone
The ground's turning cold
The stores one by one they're a-folding
My children will go
As soon they grow
Well there is nothing here now to hold them

[Verse 1]
In death, you face life with a child and a wife
Who sleep-walks through your dreams into walls
You’re a soldier of mercy, you’re cold and you curse
“He who cannot be trusted must fall”
[Verse 2]
Loneliness, tenderness, high society, notoriety
You fight for the throne and you travel alone
Unknown as you slowly sink
And there’s no time to think
[Verse 3]
In the Federal City you been blown and shown pity
In secret, for pieces of change
The empress attracts you but oppression distracts you
And it makes you feel violent and strange
[Verse 4]
Memory, ecstasy, tyranny, hypocrisy
Betrayed by a kiss on a cool night of bliss
In the valley of the missing link
And you have no time to think
[Verse 5]
Judges will haunt you, the country priestess will want you
Her worst is better than best
I’ve seen all these decoys through a set of deep turquoise eyes
And I feel so depressed
[Verse 6]
China doll, alcohol, duality, mortality
Mercury rules you and destiny fools you
Like the plague, with a dangerous wink
And there’s no time to think
[Verse 7]
Your conscience betrayed you when some tyrant waylaid you
Where the lion lies down with the lamb
I’d have paid off the traitor and killed him much later
But that’s just the way that I am
[Verse 8]
Paradise, sacrifice, mortality, reality
But the magician is quicker and his game
Is much thicker than blood and blacker than ink
And there’s no time to think
[Verse 9]
Anger and jealousy’s all that he sells us
He’s content when you’re under his thumb
Madmen oppose him, but your kindness throws him
To survive it you play deaf and dumb
[Verse 10]
Equality, liberty, humility, simplicity
You glance through the mirror and there’s eyes staring clear
At the back of your head as you drink
And there’s no time to think
[Verse 11]
Warlords of sorrow and queens of tomorrow
Will offer their heads for a prayer
You can’t find no salvation, you have no expectations
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere
[Verse 12]
Mercury, gravity, nobility, humility
You know you can’t keep her and the water gets deeper
That is leading you onto the brink
But there’s no time to think
[Verse 13]
You’ve murdered your vanity, buried your sanity
For pleasure you must now resist
Lovers obey you but they cannot sway you
They’re not even sure you exist
[Verse 14]
Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism
Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws
And the sound of the keys as they clink
But there’s no time to think
[Verse 15]
The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl
With the rose in her hair
Starlight in the East and you’re finally released
You’re stranded but with nothing to share
[Verse 16]
Loyalty, unity, epitome, rigidity
You turn around for one real last glimpse of Camille
’Neath the moon shining’ bloody and pink
And there’s no time to think
[Verse 17]
Bullets can harm you and death can disarm you
But no, you will not be deceived
Stripped of all virtue as you crawl through the dirt
You can give but you cannot receive
[Verse 18]
No time to choose when the truth must die
No time to lose or say goodbye
No time to prepare for the victim that’s there
No time to suffer or blink
And no time to think

[Verse 1]
Oh, sister, when I come to lie in your arms
You should not treat me like a stranger
Our Father would not like the way that you act
And you must realize the danger
[Verse 2]
Oh, sister, am I not a brother to you
And one deserving of affection?
And is our purpose not the same on this earth
To love and follow His direction?
[Verse 3]
We grew up together
From the cradle to the grave
We died and were reborn
And then mysteriously saved
[Verse 4]
Oh, sister, when I come to knock on your door
Don’t turn away, 
you’ll
 create sorrow
Time is an ocean but it ends at the shore
You may not see me tomorrow

[Verse 1]
Your breath is sweet
Your eyes are like two jewels in the sky
Your back is straight, your hair is smooth
On the pillow where you 
lie
But I don’t sense affection
No gratitude or love
Your loyalty is not to me
But to the stars above
[Chorus]
One more cup of coffee for the road
One more cup of coffee before I go
To the valley below
[Verse 2]
Your daddy he’s an outlaw
And a wanderer by trade
He’ll teach you how to pick and choose
And how to throw the blade
He oversees his kingdom
So no stranger does intrude
His voice it trembles as he calls out
For another plate of food
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Your sister sees the future
Like your mama and yourself
You’ve never learned to read or write
There’s no books upon your shelf
And your pleasure knows no limits
Your voice is like a meadowlark
But your heart is like an ocean
Mysterious and dark
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Down the street the dogs are barking
And the day is a-getting dark
As the night comes in a-falling
The dogs will lose their bark
And the silent night will shatter
From the sounds inside my mind
For I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
[Verse 2]
From the crossroads of my doorstep
My eyes they start to fade
As I turn my head back to the room
Where my love and I have laid
And I gaze back to the street
The sidewalk and the sign
And I’m one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind
[Verse 3]
It’s a restless hungry feeling
That don’t mean no one no good
When everything I’m a-saying
You can say it just as good
You’re right from your side
I’m right from mine
We’re both just one too many mornings
And a thousand miles behind

[Verse 1]
Perhaps it's the color of the sun cut flat and covering
The crossroads I'm standing at
Or maybe it's the weather or something like that
But mama you been on my mind
[Verse 2]
I don't mean trouble please don't put me down or get upset I am not pleading
Or saying I can't forget you
I do not pace the floor bowed down and bent but yet
Mama you been on my mind
[Verse 3]
Even though my eyes are hazy and my thoughts they might be narrow where you been don't bother me
Or bring me down with sorrow
I don't even mind who you'll be waking with tomorrow
Mama you're just on my mind
[Verse 4]
I'm not asking you to say words like yes or no please, understand me
I have no place I'm calling you to go
I'm just whispering to myself so I can't pretend that I don't know
Mama you been on my mind
[Verse 5]
When you wake up in the morning baby look inside your mirror
You know I won't be next to you, you know I won't be near
I'd just be curious to know if you can see yourself as clear
As someone who has had you on his mind

[Verse 1]
A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood
A finger fired the trigger to his name
A handle hid out in the dark
A hand set the spark
Two eyes took the aim
Behind a man’s brain
But he can’t be blamed
He’s only a pawn in their game
[Verse 2]
A South politician preaches to the poor white man
“You got more than the blacks, don’t complain
You’re better than them, you been born with white skin,” they explain
And the Negro’s name
Is used it is plain
For the politician’s gain
As he rises to fame
And the poor white remains
On the caboose of the train
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
[Verse 3]
The deputy sheriffs, the soldiers, the governors get paid
And the marshals and cops get the same
But the poor white man’s used in the hands of them all like a tool
He’s taught in his school
From the start by the rule
That the laws are with him
To protect his white skin
To keep up his hate
So he never thinks straight
About the shape that he’s in
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
[Verse 4]
From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks
And the hoof beats pound in his brain
And he’s taught how to walk in a pack
Shoot in the back, with his fist in a clinch
To hang and to lynch
To hide beneath the hood
To kill with no pain
Like a dog on a chain
He has got no name
But it ain't him to blame
He’s only a pawn in their game
[Verse 5]
Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught
They lowered him down as a king
But when the shadowy sun sets on the one
That fired the gun
He’ll see by his grave
On the stone that remains
Carved next to his name
His epitaph plain
Only a pawn in their game

[Verse 1]
Well, I wake up in the morning
There's frogs inside my socks
Your mama, she's a-hiding
Inside the icebox
Your daddy walks in wearing
A Napoleon Bonarparte mask
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, do you have to ask?
[Verse 2]
Well, I got to pet your monkey
I get a face full of claws
I ask who's in the fireplace
And you tell me Santa Claus
The milkman comes in
He's wearing a derby hat
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you have to ask me that?
[Verse 3]
Well, I asked for something to eat
I'm hungry as a hog
So I get brown rice, seaweed
And a dirty hot dog
I've got a hole
Where my stomach disappeared
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I got to think you're really weird
[Verse 4]
Your grandpa's cane
It turns into a sword
Your grandma prays to pictures
That are pasted on a board
Everything inside my pockets
Your uncle steals
And you ask why I don't live here
Honey, I can't believe that you're for real
[Verse 5]
Well, there's fist fight in the kitchen
They're enough to make me cry
The mailman comes in
Even he's got to take a side
Even the butler
He's got something to prove
Then you ask why I don't live here
Honey, how come you don't move?

[Verse 1]
Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some funny lagoon?
Ain't it hard to stumble
And land in some muddy lagoon?
Especially when it's nine below zero
And three o'clock in the afternoon
[Verse 2]
They're gonna hang no picture
They're gonna hang no picture frame
They're gonna hang no picture
Oh, they're gonna hang no picture frame
Well, I might look like Robert Ford
But I feel just like a Jesse James
[Verse 3]
Well, I wish I was on some
Australian mountain range
Oh, I wish I was on some
Australian mountain range
I got no reason to be there, but I
Imagine it would be some kind of change
[Verse 4]
I got my dark sunglasses
I got for good luck my black tooth
I got my dark sunglasses
I'm carrying for good luck my black tooth
Don't ask me nothing about nothing
I just might tell you the truth
[Verse 5]
I got a woman in Jackson
Oh, I ain't gonna say her name
I got a woman in Jackson
I ain't gonna say her name
She's a brown-skin woman, but I
Love her just the same

[Verse 1]
Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground
I am a-going down to 
Oxford Town
[Verse 2]
He went down to Oxford Town
Guns and clubs followed him down
All because his face was brown
Better get away from Oxford Town
[Verse 3]
Oxford Town around the bend
He come in to the door, he couldn’t get in
All because of the color of his skin
What do you think about that, my friend?
[Verse 4]
Me and my girl, my girl’s son
We got met with a tear gas bomb
I don’t even know why we come
Going back where we come from
[Verse 5]
Oxford Town in the afternoon
Everybody singing a sorrowful tune
Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon
Somebody better investigate soon
[Verse 6]
Oxford Town, Oxford Town
Everybody’s got their heads bowed down
The sun don’t shine above the ground
I am not a-going down to Oxford Town

[Verse 1]
Man comes to the door—I say, “For whom are you looking?”
He says, “Your wife,” I say, “She’s busy in the kitchen cooking”
Poor boy—where you been?
I already told you—won’t tell you again
[Verse 2]
I say, “How much you want for that?” I go into the store
The man says, “Three dollars.” “All right,” I say, “Will you take four?”
Poor boy—never say die
Things will be all right by and by
[Verse 3]
Been working on the mainline—working like the devil
The game is the same—it’s just on a different level
Poor boy—dressed in black
Police at your back
[Verse 4]
Poor boy in a red hot town
Out beyond the twinkling stars
Riding first-class trains—making the rounds
Trying to keep from falling between the cars
[Verse 5]
Othello told Desdemona, “I’m cold, cover me with a blanket
By the way, what happened to that poison wine?”
She says, “I gave it to you, you drank it”
Poor boy, laying them straight—picking up the cherries falling off the plate
[Verse 6]
Time and love has branded me with its claws
Had to go to Florida, dodging them Georgia laws
Poor boy, in the hotel called the Palace of Gloom
Calls down to room service, says send up a room
[Verse 7]
My mother was a daughter of a wealthy farmer
My father was a traveling salesman, I never met him
When my mother died, my uncle took me in—he ran a funeral parlor
He did a lot of nice things for me and I won’t forget him
[Verse 8]
All I know is that I’m thrilled by your kiss
I don’t know any more than this
Poor boy, picking up sticks
Build you a house out of mortar and bricks
[Verse 9]
Knocking on the door, I say, “Who is it and where are you from?”
Man says, “Freddy!” I say, “Freddy who?” He says, “Freddy or not here I come”
Poor boy beneath the stars that shine
Washing them dishes, feeding them swine

[Verse 1]
You got a lotta nerve
To say you are my friend
When I was down
You just stood there grinning
You got a lotta nerve
To say you got a helping hand to lend
You just want to be on
The side that’s winning
[Verse 2]
You say I let you down
You know it’s not like that
If you’re so hurt
Why then don’t you show it
You say you lost your faith
But that’s not where it’s at
You had no faith to lose
And you know it
[Verse 3]
I know the reason
That you talk behind my back
I used to be among the crowd
You’re in with
Do you take me for such a fool
To think I’d make contact
With the one who tries to hide
What he don’t know to begin with
[Verse 4]
You see me on the street
You always act surprised
You say, “How are you?” “Good luck”
But you don’t mean it
When you know as well as me
You’d rather see me paralyzed
Why don’t you just come out once
And scream it
[Verse 5]
No, I do not feel that good
When I see the heartbreaks you embrace
If I was a master thief
Perhaps I’d rob them
And now I know you’re dissatisfied
With your position and your place
Don’t you understand
It’s not my problem
[Verse 6]
I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
And just for that one moment
I could be you
Yes, I wish that for just one time
You could stand inside my shoes
You’d know what a drag it is
To see you

[Verse 1]
When your mother sends back all your invitations
And your father to your sister he explains
That you’re tired of yourself and all of your creations
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
[Verse 2]
Now when all of the flower ladies want back what they have lent you
And the smell of their roses does not remain
And all of your children start to resent you
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
[Verse 3]
Now when all the clowns that you have commissioned
Have died in battle or in vain
And you’re sick of all this repetition
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
[Verse 4]
When all of your advisers heave their plastic
At your feet to convince you of your pain
Trying to prove that your conclusions should be more drastic
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
[Verse 5]
Now when all the bandits that you 
turned your other cheek
 to
All lay down their bandanas and complain
And you want somebody you don’t have to speak to
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?
Won’t you come see me, Queen Jane?

[Verse 1]
Well, they'll stone you when you're trying to be so good
They'll stone you just like they said they would
They'll stone you when you're tryna go 
home
Then they'll stone you when you're there all alone
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
[Verse 2]
Well, they'll stone you when you're walking along the streets
They'll stone you when you're tryna keep your seat
They'll stone you when you're walking on the floor
They'll stone you when you're walking to the door
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
[Verse 3]
They'll stone you when you're at the breakfast table
They'll stone you when you are young and able
They'll stone you when you're tryna make a buck
They'll stone you and then they'll say, "Good luck"
Tell ya what, I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned
[Verse 4]
Well, they'll stone you and say that it's the end
Then they'll stone you and then they'll come back again
They'll stone you when you're riding in your car
They'll stone you when you're playing your guitar
Yes but I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned, alright
[Verse 5]
Well, they'll stone you when you walk all alone
They'll stone you when you are walking home
They'll stone you and then say they all are brave
They'll stone you when you're set down in your grave
But I would not feel so all alone
Everybody must get stoned

[Verse 1]
Doctor, doctor tell me the time of day
Another 
bottle's
 
empty, another penny spent
He turned around and he slowly walked away
They 
shot him in the back and down he went
[Chorus]
Shine your light
Movin' on
You 
burned so bright
Roll on, John
[Verse 2]
From the Liverpool docks to the red-light Hamburg streets
Down in the quarry with the quarrymen
Playing to the big crowds, playing to the cheap seats
Another day in the life
 on your way to your 
journey's end
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Sailin' through the trade winds bound for the South
Rags on your back
 
just like any other slave
They tied your hands and they clamped your mouth
Wasn't no way out of that deep dark cave
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
I read the news today, oh boy
They hauled your ship up on the shore
Now the city gone dark, there is no more joy
They tore the heart right out and cut him to the core
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Put on your bags
 and get 
'em packed
Leave right now, you won't be far from wrong
The sooner you go the quicker you'll be back
You've been cooped up on an island far too long
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
Slow down you're moving way too fast
Come together right now over me
Your bones are weary, you're about to breathe your last
Lord, you know how hard that it can be
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
Roll on, John,
 
roll through the rain and snow
Take the right-hand road
 and go 
where the buffalo roam
They'll trap you in an ambush before you know
Too late now to sail back home
[Chorus]
[Verse 8]
Tyger, tyger burning bright
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
In the forests of the night
Cover 'em over and 
let him sleep
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Hot chili peppers in the blistering sun
Dust on my face and my cape
Me and Magdalena on the run
I think this time we shall escape
Sold my guitar to the baker’s son
For a few crumbs and a place to hide
But I can get another one
And I’ll play for Magdalena as we ride
[Chorus]
No Ilores, mi querida
Dios nos vigila
Soon the horse will take us to Durango
Agarrame, mi vida
Soon the desert will be gone
Soon you will be dancing the fandango
[Verse 2]
Past the Aztec ruins and the ghosts of our people
Hoof beats like castanets on stone
At night I dream of bells in the village steeple
Then I see the bloody face of Ramon
Was it me that shot him down in the Cantina
Was it my hand that held the gun?
Come, let us fly, my Magdalena
The dogs are barking and what’s done is done
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
In the corridor we’ll sit in the shade
And watch the young torero stand alone
We’ll drink tequila where our grandfathers stayed
When they rode with Villa into Torreón
Then the padre will recite the prayers of old
In the little church this side of town
I will wear new boots and an earring of gold
You’ll shine with diamonds in your wedding gown
The way is long but the end is near
Already the fiesta has begun
The face of God will appear
With His serpent eyes of obsidian
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Was that the thunder that I heard?
My head is vibrating, I feel a sharp pain
Come sit by me, don’t say a word
Oh, can it be that I am slain?
Quick, Magdalena, take my gun
Look up in the hills, that flash of light
Aim well my little one
We may not make it through the night
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
With your mercury mouth in the missionary times
And your eyes like smoke and your prayers like rhymes
And your silver cross, and your voice like chimes
Oh, who among them do they think could bury you?
With your pockets well protected at last
And your streetcar visions which you place on the grass
And your flesh like silk, and your face like glass
Who among them do they think could carry you?
[Hook]
Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands
Where the sad-eyed prophet says that no man comes
My warehouse eyes, my Arabian drums
Should I leave them by your gate
Or, sad-eyed lady, should I wait?
[Verse 2]
With your sheets like metal and your belt like lace
And your deck of cards missing the jack and the ace
And your basement clothes and your hollow face
Who among them can think he could outguess you?
With your silhouette when the sunlight dims
Into your eyes where the moonlight swims
And your matchbook songs and your gypsy hymns
Who among them would try to impress you?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The kings of Tyrus with their convict list
Are waiting in line for their geranium kiss
And you wouldn’t know it would happen like this
But who among them really wants just to kiss you?
With your childhood flames on your midnight rug
And your Spanish manners and your mother’s drugs
And your cowboy mouth and your curfew plugs
Who among them do you think could resist you?
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
Oh, the farmers and the businessmen, they all did decide
To show you the dead angels that they used to hide
But why did they pick you to sympathize with their side?
Oh, how could they ever mistake you?
They wished you’d accepted the blame for the farm
But with the sea at your feet and the phony false alarm
And with the child of a hoodlum wrapped up in your arms
How could they ever, ever persuade you?
[Hook]
[Verse 5]
With your sheet-metal memory of Cannery Row
And your magazine-husband who one day just had to go
And your gentleness now, which you just can’t help but show
Who among them do you think would employ you?
Now you stand with your thief, you’re on his parole
With your holy medallion which your fingertips fold
And your saintlike face and your ghostlike soul
Oh, who among them do you think could destroy you?
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I laid on a dune, I looked at the sky
When the children were babies and played on the beach
You came up behind me, I saw you go by
You were always so close and still within reach
[Verse 2]
Sara, Sara
Whatever made you want to change your mind?
Sara, Sara
So easy to look at, so hard to define
[Verse 3]
I can still see them playing with their pails in the sand
They run to the water their buckets to fill
I can still see the shells falling out of their hands
As they follow each other back up the hill
[Verse 4]
Sara, Sara
Sweet virgin angel, sweet love of my life
Sara, Sara
Radiant jewel, mystical wife
[Verse 5]
Sleeping in the woods by a fire in the night
Drinking white rum in a Portugal bar
Them playing leapfrog and hearing about Snow White
You in the marketplace in Savanna-la-Mar
[Verse 6]
Sara, Sara
It’s all so clear, I could never forget
Sara, Sara
Loving you is the one thing I’ll never regret
[Verse 7]
I can still hear the sounds of those Methodist bells
I’d taken the cure and had just gotten through
Staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel
Writing “Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands” for you
[Verse 8]
Sara, Sara
Wherever we travel we’re never apart
Sara, oh Sara
Beautiful lady, so dear to my heart
[Verse 9]
How did I meet you? I don’t know
A messenger sent me in a tropical storm
You were there in the winter, moonlight on the snow
And on Lily Pond Lane when the weather was warm
[Verse 10]
Sara, oh Sara
Scorpio Sphinx in a calico dress
Sara, Sara
You must forgive me my unworthiness
[Vere 11]
Now the beach is deserted except for some kelp
And a piece of an old ship that lies on the shore
You always responded when I needed your help
You give me a map and a key to your door
[Verse 12]
Sara, oh Sara
Glamorous nymph with an arrow and bow
Sara, oh Sara
Don’t ever leave me, don’t ever go

[Verse 1]
In Scarlet Town, where I was born
There’s ivy leaf and silver thorn
The streets have names that you can’t pronounce
Gold is down to a quarter of an ounce
The music starts and the people sway
Everybody says, “Are you going my way?"
Uncle Tom still working' for Uncle Bill
Scarlet Town is under the hill
[Verse 2]
Scarlet Town in the month of May
Sweet William Holme on his deathbed lay
Mistress Mary by the side of the bed
Kissing' his face and putting' prayers on his head
So brave and true, so gentle is he
I’ll weep for him as he would weep for me
Little Boy Blue come blow your horn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born
[Verse 3]
Scarlet Town, in the hot noon hours
There’s palm-leaf shadows and scattered flowers
Beggars crouching at the gate
Help comes, but it comes too late
By marble slabs and in fields of stone
You make your humble wishes known
I touched the garment, but the hem was torn
In Scarlet Town, where I was born
[Verse 4]
In Scarlet Town, the end is near
The Seven Wonders of the World are here
The evil and the good living' side by side
All human forms seem glorified
Put your heart on a platter and see who will bite
See who will hold you and kiss you good night
There’s walnut groves and maplewood
In Scarlet Town crying' won’t do no good
[Verse 5]
In Scarlet Town, you fight your father’s foes
Up on the hill, a chilly wind blows
You fight ‘em on high and you fight 'em down in
You fight 'em with whiskey, morphine and gin
You’ve got legs that can drive men mad
A lot of things we didn’t do that I wish we had
In Scarlet Town, the sky is clear
You’ll wish to God that you stayed right here
[Verse 6]
Set ‘em Joe, play “Walking the Floor"
Play it for my flat-chested junkie whore
I’m staying up late, I’m making amends
While we smile, all heaven descends
If love is a sin, then beauty is a crime
All things are beautiful in their time
The black and the white, the yellow and the brown
It’s all right there in front of you in Scarlet Town

[Chorus]
Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask for you
Well there's one kind of favor I'll ask for you
There's just one kind of favor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean
[Verse 1]
And there's two white horses following me
And there's two white horses following me
I got two white horses following me
Waiting on my burying ground
[Verse 2]
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Did you ever hear that coffin sound
Means another poor boy is under the ground
[Verse 3]
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Did you ever hear them church bells toll
Means another poor boy is dead and gone
[Verse 4]
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold
And I believe what the father told
[Chorus]
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And there's one last favor I'll ask for you
And just one last flavor I'll ask for you
You can see that my grave is kept clean

[Verse 1]
Old Reilly stole a stallion
But they caught him and they brought him back
And they laid him down on the Jailhouse ground
With an iron chain around his neck
[Verse 2]
Old Reilly’s daughter got a message
That her father was going’ to hang
She rode by night and came by morning
With gold and silver in her hand
[Verse 3]
When the judge he saw Reilly’s daughter
His old eyes deepened in his head
Saying, “Gold will never free your father
The price, my dear, is you instead”
[Verse 4]
“Oh I’m as good as dead,” cried Reilly
“It’s only you that he does crave
And my skin will surely crawl if he touches you at all
Get on your horse and ride away”
[Verse 5]
“Oh father you will surely die
If I don’t take the chance to try
And pay the price and not take your advice
For that reason I will have to stay”
[Verse 6]
The gallows shadows shook the evening
In the night a hound dog bayed
In the night the grounds were groaning
In the night the price was paid
[Verse 7]
The next morning she had awoken
To know that the judge had never spoken
She saw that hangin’ branch a-bendin’
She saw her father’s body broken
[Verse 8]
These be seven curses on a judge so cruel:
That one doctor will not save him
That two healers will not heal him
That three eyes will not see him
[Verse 9]
That four ears will not hear him
That five walls will not hide him
That six diggers will not bury him
And that seven deaths shall never kill him

[Verse 1]
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She's got everything she needs
She's an artist, she don't look back
She can take the dark out of nighttime
And paint the daytime black
[Verse 2]
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
You will start out standing
Proud to steal her anything she sees
But you will wind up peeking through her keyhole
Down upon your knees
[Verse 3]
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She never stumbles
She's got no place to fall
She's nobody's child
The Law can't touch her at all
[Verse 4]
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She wears an Egyptian ring
That sparkles before she speaks
She's a hypnotist collector
You are a walking antique
[Verse 5]
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
Bow down to her on Sunday
Salute her when her birthday comes
For Halloween buy her a trumpet
And for Christmas, give it a drum

[Verse 1]
I was in another lifetime one of toil and blood
When blackness was a virtue and the road was full of mud
I came in from the wilderness a creature void of form
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 2]
And if I pass this way again you can rest assured
I'll always do my best for her on that I give my word
In a world of steel-eyed death and men who are fighting to be warm
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 3]
Not a word was spoke between us there was little risk involved
Everything up to that point had been left unresolved
Try imagining a place where it's always safe and warm
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 4]
I was burned out from exhaustion buried in the hail
Poisoned in the bushes and blown out on the trail
Hunted like a crocodile ravaged in the corn
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 5]
Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
She walked up to me so gracefully
 and took my 
crown of thorns
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 6]
Now there's a wall between us something there's been lost
I took too much for granted got my signals crossed
Just to think that it all began on a long-forgotten morn
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 7]
Well the deputy walks on hard nails and the preacher rides a mount
But nothing really matters much it's doom alone that counts
And the one-eyed undertaker he blows a futile horn
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 8]
I've heard newborn babies wailing like a mourning dove
And old men with broken teeth stranded without love
Do I understand your question man is it hopeless and forlorn
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 9]
In a little hilltop village they gambled for my clothes
I bargained for salvation and 
they gave me a lethal dose
I offered up my innocence and got repaid with scorn
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"
[Verse 10]
Well I'm living in a foreign country but I'm bound to cross the line
Beauty walks a razor's edge someday I'll make it mine
If I could only turn back the clock to when God and her were born
"Come in" she said, "I'll give you shelter from the storm"

[Verse 1]
Oh, Shenandoah
, I long to hear you
Look away, you rolling river
Oh, Shenandoah, I long to hear you
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
[Verse 2]
Now the Missouri is a mighty river
Look away, you rolling river
Indians camp along her border
Look away. We're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
[Verse 3]
Well a white man loved an Indian maiden
Look away, you rolling river
With notions his canoe was laden
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
[Verse 4]
Oh Shenandoah, I love your daughter
Look away, you rolling river
It was for her I'd cross the water
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
[Verse 5]
For seven long years I courted Sally
Look away, you rolling river
Seven more years I longed to have her
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri
[Verse 6]
Well, it's fare-thee-well, my dear
I'm bound to leave you
Look away you rolling river
Shenandoah, I will not deceive you
Look away, we're bound away
Across the wide Missouri

[Verse 1]
They sat together in the park
As the evening sky grew dark
She looked at him and he felt a spark tingle to his bones
It was then he felt alone and wished that he'd gone straight
And watched out for a simple twist of fate
[Verse 2]
They walked alone by the old canal
A little confused I remember well
And stopped into a strange hotel with a neon burning bright
He felt the heat of the night hit him like a freight train
Moving with a simple twist of fate
[Verse 3]
A saxophone someplace far off played
As she was walking on by the arcade
As the light bust through a-beat-up shade where he was waking up
She dropped a coin into the cup of a blind man at the gate
And forgot about a simple twist of fate
[Verse 4]
He woke up the room was bare
He didn't see her anywhere
He told himself he didn't care pushed the window open wide
Felt an emptiness inside to which he just could not relate
Brought on by a simple twist of fate
[Verse 5]
He hears the ticking of the clocks
And walks along with 
a parrot that talks
Hunts her down by the waterfront docks where the sailers all come in
Maybe she'll pick him out again how long must he wait
One more time for a simple twist of fate
[Verse 6]
People tell me it's a sin
To know and feel too much within
I still believe she was my twin but I lost the ring
She was born in spring but I was born too late
Blame it on a simple twist of fate

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel so low-down and disgusted
Can’t help but wonder what’s happening to my companions
Are they lost or are they found
Have they counted the cost it’ll take to bring down
All their earthly principles they’re going to have to abandon?
There’s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
[Verse 2]
I had a woman down in Alabama
She was a backwoods girl, but she sure was realistic
She said, “Boy, without a doubt
Have to quit your mess and straighten out
You could die down here, be just another accident statistic”
There’s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
[Verse 3]
All that foreign oil controlling American soil
Look around you, it’s just bound to make you embarrassed
Sheiks walking around like kings
Wearing fancy jewels and nose rings
Deciding America’s future from Amsterdam and to Paris
And there’s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
[Verse 4]
Man’s ego is inflated, his laws are outdated, they don’t apply no more
You can’t rely no more to be standing around waiting
In the home of the brave
Jefferson turning over in his grave
Fools glorifying themselves, trying to manipulate Satan
And there’s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
[Verse 5]
Big-time negotiators, false healers and woman haters
Masters of the bluff and masters of the proposition
But the enemy I see
Wears a cloak of decency
All nonbelievers and men stealers talking in the name of religion
And there’s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
[Verse 6]
People starving and thirsting, grain elevators are bursting
Oh, you know it costs more to store the food than it do to give it
They say lose your inhibitions
Follow your own ambitions
They talk about a life of brotherly love show me someone who knows how to live it
There’s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend
[Verse 7]
Well, my baby went to Illinois with some bad-talking boy she could destroy
A real suicide case, but there was nothing I could do to stop it
I don’t care about the economy
I don’t care about astronomy
But it sure do bother me to see my loved ones turning into puppets
There’s a slow, slow train coming up around the bend

[Verse 1]
I’m out here a thousand miles from my home
Walking a road other men have gone down
I’m seeing your world of people and things
Your paupers and peasants and princes and kings
[Verse 2]
Hey, hey, 
Woody Guthrie,
 I wrote you a song
About a funny old world that’s a-coming along
Seems sick and it’s hungry, it’s tired and it’s torn
It looks like it’s a-dying and it’s hardly been born
[Verse 3]
Hey, Woody Guthrie, but I know that you know
All the things that I’m a-saying an a-many times more
I’m a-singing you the song, but I can’t sing enough
Because there’s not many men that done the things that you’ve done
[Verse 4]
Here’s to Cisco and Sonny and Leadbelly too
And to all the good people that traveled with you
Here’s to the hearts and the hands of the men
That come with the dust
 and are 
gone with the wind
[Verse 5]
I’m a-leaving tomorrow, but I could leave today
Somewhere down the road someday
The very last thing that I’d want to do
Is to say I’ve been hitting some hard traveling too

[Verse 1]
I'm searching for phrases
To sing your praises
I need to tell someone
It's soon after midnight
And my day has just begun
[Verse 2]
A gal named Honey
Took my money
She was passing by
It's soon after midnight
And the moon is in my eye
[Verse 3]
My heart is cheerful
It's never fearful
I've been down on the 
killing floors
I'm in no great hurry
I'm not afraid of your fury
I've faced stronger walls than yours
[Verse 4]
Charlotte's a harlot
Dresses in scarlet
Mary dresses in mink
It's soon after midnight
And I've got a date with the
 
fairy queen
[Verse 5]
They chirp and they chatter
What does it matter?
They lie and dine in their blood
Two-timing slim
Who's ever heard of him?
I'll drag his corpse through the mud
[Verse 6]
It's now or never
More than ever
When I met you 
I didn't think you do
It's soon after midnight
And I 
don't want nobody but you

[Verse 1]
Spirit on the water
Darkness on the face of the deep
I keep thinking about you baby
I can't hardly sleep
[Verse 2]
I'm traveling by land
Traveling through the dawn of day
You're always on my mind
I can't stay away
[Verse 3]
I'd forgotten about you
Then you turned up again
I always knew
That we were meant to be more than friends
[Verse 4]
When you are near
It's just as plain as it can be
I'm wild about you, gal
You ought to be a fool about me
[Verse 5]
Can't explain
The sources of this hidden pain
You burned your way into my heart
You got the key to my brain
[Verse 6]
I've been trampling through mud
Praying to the powers above
I'm sweating blood
You got a face that begs for love
[Verse 7]
Life without you
Doesn't mean a thing to me
If I can't have you
I'll throw my love into the deep blue sea
[Verse 8]
Sometimes I wonder
Why you can't treat me right
You do good all day
Then you do wrong all night
[Verse 9]
When you're with me
I'm a thousand times happier than I could ever say
What does it matter
What price I pay
[Verse 10]
They brag about your sugar
Brag about it all over town
Put some sugar in my bowl
I feel like laying down
[Verse 11]
I'm pale as a ghost
Holding a blossom on a stem
You ever seen a ghost? No
But you have heard of them
[Verse 12]
I see you there
I'm blinded by the colors I see
I take good care
Of what belongs to me
[Verse 13]
I hear your name
Ringing up and down the line
I'm saying it plain
These ties are strong enough to bind
[Verse 14]
Your sweet voice
Calls out from some old familiar shrine
I got no choice
Can't believe these things would ever fade from your mind
[Verse 15]
I could live forever
With you perfectly
You don't ever
Have to make a fuss over me
[Verse 16]
From East to West
Ever since the world began
I only mean it for the best
I want to be with you any way I can
[Verse 17]
I been in a brawl
Now I'm feeling the wall
I'm going away baby
I won't be back ‘till fall
[Verse 18]
High on the hill
You can carry all my thoughts with you
You've numbed my will
This love could tear me in two
[Verse 19]
I wanna be with you in paradise
And it seems so unfair
I can't go to paradise no more
I killed a man back there
[Verse 20]
You think I'm over the hill
You think I'm past my prime
Let me see what you got
We can have a whoppin' good time

[Verse 1]
I'm walking through the
 
summer nights
The jukebox playing low
Yesterday everything was going too fast
Today it's moving too slow
I got no place left to turn
I got nothing left to burn
Don't know if I saw you if I would kiss you or kill you
It probably wouldn't matter to you anyhow
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
I got nothing to go back to now
[Verse 2]
The light in this place is so bad
Making me sick in the head
All the laughter is just making me sad
The stars have turned cherry red
I'm strumming on my gay guitar
Smoking a cheap cigar
The ghost of our old love has not gone away
Don't look it like it will anytime soon
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Under the midnight moon
[Verse 3]
Maybe they'll get me and maybe they won't
But not tonight and it won't be here
There are things I could say, but I don't
I know the mercy of God must be near
I've been riding a midnight train
Got ice water in my veins
I would be crazy if I took you back
It would go up against every rule
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Suffering like a fool
[Verse 4]
When the last rays of daylight go down
Buddy, you're old no more
I can hear the church bells ringing in the yard
I wonder who they're ringing for
I know I can't win
But my heart just won't give in
Last night I danced with a stranger
But she just reminded me you were the one
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
In the dark land of the sun
[Verse 5]
I eat when I'm hungry, drink when I'm dry
And live my life on the square
And even if the flesh falls off of my face
I know someone will be there to care
It always means so much
Even the softest touch
I see nothing to be gained by any explanation
There's no words that need to be said
You left me standing in the doorway, crying
Blues wrapped around my head

[Verse 1]
Oh, the ragman draws circles
Up and down the block
I’d ask him what the matter was
But I know that he don’t talk
And the ladies treat me kindly
And furnish me with tape
But deep inside my heart
I know I can't escape
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 2]
Well, Shakespeare, he’s in the alley
With his pointed shoes and his bells
Speaking to some French girl
Who says she knows me well
And I would send a message
To find out if she’s talked
But the post office has been stolen
And the mailbox is locked
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 3]
Mona tried to tell me
To stay away from the train line
She said that all the railroad men
Just drink up your blood like wine
And I said, “Oh, I didn’t know that
But then again, there’s only one I’ve met
And he just smoked my eyelids
And punched my cigarette”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 4]
Grandpa died last week
And now he’s buried in the rocks
But everybody still talks about
How badly they were shocked
But me, I expected it to happen
I knew he’d lost control
When he built a fire on Main Street
And shot it full of holes
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 5]
Now the senator came down here
Showing everyone his gun
Handing out free tickets
To the wedding of his son
And me, I nearly got busted
And wouldn’t it be my luck
To get caught without a ticket
And be discovered beneath a truck
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 6]
Now the preacher looked so baffled
When I asked him why he dressed
With twenty pounds of headlines
Stapled to his chest
But he cursed me when I proved it to him
Then I whispered, “Not even you can hide
You see, you’re just like me
I hope you’re satisfied”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 7]
Now the rainman gave me two cures
Then he said, “Jump right in”
The one was 
Texas medicine
The other was just railroad gin
And like a fool I mixed them
And it strangled up my mind
And now people just get uglier
And I have no sense of time
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 8]
When Ruthie says come see her
In her honky-tonk lagoon
Where I can watch her waltz for free
’Neath her Panamanian moon
And I say, “Aw come on now
You must know about my debutante”
And she says, “Your debutante just knows what you need
But I know what you want”
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again
[Verse 9]
Now the bricks lay on Grand Street
Where the neon madmen climb
They all fall there so perfectly
It all seems so well timed
And here I sit so patiently
Waiting to find out what price
You have to pay to get out of
Going through all these things twice
Oh, Mama, can this really be the end
To be stuck inside of Mobile
With the Memphis blues again

[Verse 1]
Johnny's in the basement, mixing up the medicine
I'm on the pavement, thinking about the government
The man in the trench coat, badge out, laid off
Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off
Look out kid, it's something you did
God knows when, but you're doing it again
You better duck down the alleyway looking for a new friend
The man in the coon-skin cap in the pig pen
Wants 11 dollar bills - you only got 10
[Verse 2]
Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot
Talking that the heat put plants in the bet book
Phone's tapped anyway
Maggie says "The Man, he say"
They must bust in early May, "Orders from the D.A."
Look out kid, don't matter what you did
Walk on your tip toes,
 
don’t tie no Bows
Better stay away from those that carry around a fire hose
Keep a clean nose, watch the plainclothes
You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows
[Verse 3]
Get sick, get well, hang around a ink well
Write braille, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell
Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail
Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail
Look out kid you're going to get hit
By losers, cheaters, 6-time users
Hanging round the theaters
Girl by the whirlpool looking for a new fool
Don't follow leaders, watch the parking meters
[Verse 4]
Oh, get born, keep warm
Short pants, romance
Learn to dance, get dressed
Get blessed, try to be a success
Please her, please him, buy gifts
Don't steal, don't lift
20 years of schooling and they put you on the day shift
Look out kid, they keep it all hid
Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle
Don't wear sandals - you can't afford the scandal
Don't want to be a bum: you better chew gum
The pump don't work because the vandals took the handle

[Verse 1]
Well I'm grinding my life out, steady and sure
Nothing more wretched than what I must endure
I'm drenched in the light that shines from the sun
I could stone you to death for the wrongs that you done
Sooner or later you make a mistake
I'll put you in a chain that you never will break
Legs and arms and body and bone
I pay in blood, but not my own
[Verse 2]
Night after night, day after day
They strip your useless hopes away
The more I take the more I give
The more I die the more I live
I got something in my pocket make your eyeballs swim
I got dogs could tear you limb from limb
I'm circling around the Southern Zone
I pay in blood, but not my own
[Verse 3]
Low cards are what I've got
But I'll play this hand whether I like it or not
I'm sworn to uphold the laws of God
You could put me out in front of a firing squad
I've been out and around with the rowdy men
Just like you, my handsome friend
My head's so hard, must be made of stone
I pay in blood, but not my own
[Verse 4]
Another politician pumping out the piss
Another angry beggar blowing you a kiss
You got the same eyes that your mother does
If only you could prove who your father was
Someone must have slipped a drug in your wine
You gulped it down and you cross the line
Man can't live by bread alone
I pay in blood, but not my own
[Verse 5]
How I made it back home, nobody knows
Or how I survived so many blows
I've been through hell, what good did it do?
You bastard! I'm suppose to respect you?
I'll give you justice, I'll fatten your purse
Show me your moral virtues first
Hear me holler and hear me moan
I pay in blood but not my own
You pet your lover in the bed
Come here, I'll break your lousy head
Our nation must be saved and freed
You've been accused of murder, how do you plead?
This is how I spend my days
I came to bury, not to praise
I'll drink my fill and sleep alone
I pay in blood, but not my own

[Verse 1]
I saw it advertised one day
Bear mountain picnic was coming my way
"come along 'n' take a trip
We'll bring you up there on a ship
Bring the wife and kids
Bring the whole family"
Yippee
!
[Verse 2]
Well, I run right down 'n' bought a ticket
To this bear mountain picnic
But little did I realize
I was in for a picnic surprise
Had nothing to do with mountains
I didn't even come close to a bear
[Verse 3]
Took the wife 'n' kids down to the pier
Six thousand people there
Everybody had ticket for the trip
"oh well." I said, "it's a pretty big ship
Besides, anyway, the more the merrier"
[Verse 4]
Well, we all got on 'n' what do you think
That big old boat started to sink
More people kept a-piling on
That old ship was a-slowly going down
Funny way to start a picnic
[Verse 5]
Well, I soon lost track of my kids 'n' wife
So many people there I never saw in my life
That old ship sinking down in the water
Six thousand people trying to kill each other
Dogs a-barking, cats a-meowing
Women screaming, fists a-flying, babies crying
Cops a-coming, me a-running
Maybe we just better call off the picnic
[Verse 6]
I got shoved down 'n' pushed around
All I could hear there was a screaming sound
Don't remember one thing more
Just remember walking up on a little shore
Head busted, stomach cracked
Feet splintered, I was bald, naked
Quite lucky to be alive though
[Verse 7]
Feeling like I climbed out of my casket
I grabbed back hold of my picnic basket
Took the wife 'n' kids 'n' started home
Wishing I'd never got up that morn
[Verse 8]
Now, I don't care just what you do
If you want a have a picnic, that's up to you
But don't tell me about it, I don't want a hear it
Because, see, I just lost all my picnic spirit
Stay in my kitchen, have my own picnic
In the bathroom
[Verse 9]
Now, it don't seem to me quite so funny
What some people are going to do for money
There's a brand new gimmick every day
Just to take somebody's money away
I think we ought to take some of these people
And put them on a boat, send them up to bear mountain
For a picnic
   

[Verse 1]
Well, I was feeling sad and feeling’ blue
I didn’t know what in the world I woos gonna do
Them Communists they woos coming around
They woos in the air
They woos on the ground
They wouldn’t give me no peace
[Verse 2]
So I run down most hurriedly
And joined up with the John Birch Society
I got me a secret membership card
And started off a-walking down the road
Yee-hoo, I’m a real John Bircher now!
Look out you Commies!
[Verse 3]
Now we all agree with Hitler’s views
Although he killed six million Jews
It don’t matter too much that he was a Fascist
At least you can’t say he was a Communist!
That’s to say like if you got a cold you take a shot of malaria
[Verse 4]
Well, I woos looking everywhere for them gol-darned Reds
I got up in the morning and looked under my bed
Looked in the sink, behind the door
Looked in the glove compartment of my car
Couldn’t find them
[Verse 5]
I woos looking high and low for them Reds everywhere
I woos looking in the sink and underneath the chair
I looked way up my chimney hole
I even looked deep down inside my toilet bowl
They got away
[Verse 6]
Well, I woos sitting home alone and started to sweat
Figured they woos in my T.V. set
Peeked behind the picture frame
Got a shock from my feet, hitting right up in the brain
Them Reds caused it!
I know they did them hard-core ones
[Verse 7]
Well, I quit my job so I could work all alone
Then I changed my name to Sherlock Holmes
Followed some clues from my detective bag
And discovered they woos red stripes on the American flag!
That old Betsy Ross
[Verse 8]
Well, I investigated all the books in the library
Ninety percent of them gotta be burned away
I investigated all the people that I know
Ninety-eight percent of them gotta go
The other two percent are fellow Birchers just like me
[Verse 9]
Now Eisenhower, he’s a Russian spy
Lincoln, Jefferson and that Roosevelt guy
To my knowledge there’s just one man
That’s really a true American: George Lincoln Rockwell
I know for a fact he hates Commies because he picketed the movie Exodus
[Verse 10]
Well, I finally started thinking straight
When I run out of things to investigate
Couldn’t imagine doing anything else
So now I’m sitting home investigating myself!
Hope I don’t find out anything hmm, great God!

[Verse 1]
Rambling out to the wild West
Leaving the towns I love the best
Thought I’d seen some ups and downs
Till I come into New York town
People going down to the ground
Buildings going up to the sky
[Verse 2]
Wintertime in New York town
The wind blowing snow around
Walk around with nowhere to go
Somebody could freeze right to the bone
I froze right to the bone
New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years
I didn’t feel so cold then
[Verse 3]
I swung on to my old guitar
Grabbed hold of a subway car
And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride
I landed up on the downtown side
Greenwich Village
[Verse 4]
I walked down there and ended up
In one of them coffee-houses on the block
Got on the stage to sing and play
Man there said, “Come back some other day
You sound like a hillbilly
We want folk singers here”
[Verse 5]
Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play
Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day
I blowed inside out and upside down
The man there said he loved them sound
He was raving about how he loved them sound
Dollar a day’s worth
[Verse 6]
And after weeks and weeks of hanging around
I finally got a job in New York town
In a bigger place, bigger money too
Even joined the union and paid their dues
[Verse 7]
Now, a very great man once said
That some people rob you with a fountain pen
It didn’t take too long to find out
Just what he was talkin’ about
A lot of people don’t have much food on their table
But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives
And they got to cut something
[Verse 8]
So one morning when the sun was warm
I rambled out of New York town
Pulled my cap down over my eyes
And headed out for the western skies
So long, New York
Howdy, East Orange

[Verse 1]
Some time ago a crazy dream came to me
I dreamed I was walking into World War Three
I went to the doctor the very next day
To see what kind of words he could say
He said it was a bad dream
I wouldn’t worry about it none, though
They were my own dreams and they’re only in my head
[Verse 2]
I said, “Hold it, Doc, a World War passed through my brain”
He said, “Nurse, get your pad, this boy’s insane”
He grabbed my arm, I said, “Ouch!”
As I landed on the psychiatric couch
He said, “Tell me about it”
[Verse 3]
Well, the whole thing started at 
3 o’clock
 fast
It was all over by quarter past
I was down in the sewer with some little lover
When I peeked out from a manhole cover
Wondering who turned the lights on
[Verse 4]
Well, I got up and walked around
And up and down the lonesome town
I stood a-wondering which way to go
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
 and walked on down the road
It was a normal day
[Verse 4]
Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell
And I leaned my head and I gave a yell
“Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”
A shotgun fired and away I ran
I don’t blame them too much though, I know I look funny
[Verse 5]
Down at the corner by a hot-dog stand
I seen a man
I said, “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”
He screamed a bit and away he flew
Thought I was a Communist
[Verse 6]
Well, I spied a girl and before she could leave
“Let’s go and play Adam and Eve”
I took her by the hand and my heart it was thumping
When she said, “Hey man, you crazy or thumping
You see what happened last time they started”
[Verse 7]
Well, I seen a Cadillac window uptown
And there was nobody around
I got into the driver’s seat
And I drove down 42nd Street
In my Cadillac
Good car to drive after a war
[Verse 8]
Well, I remember seeing some ad
So I turned on my 
Conelrad
But I didn’t pay my Con Ed bill
So the radio didn’t work so well
Turned on my record player—
It was
 
Rock-a-day Johnny
 
singing, “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa
Our Love’s A-going to Grow Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”
[Verse 9]
I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue
I needed somebody to talk to
So I called up the operator of time
Just to hear a voice of some kind
“When you hear the beep it will be three o’clock”
She said that for over an hour
And I hung up
[Verse 10]
Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then
Saying, “Hey I’ve been having the same old dreams
But mine was a little different you see
I dreamed that the only person left after the war was me
I didn’t see you around
”
[Verse 11]
Well, now time passed and now it seems
Everybody’s having them dreams
Everybody sees themselves
Walking around with no one else
Half of the people can be part right all of the time
Some of the people can be all right part of the time
But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time
I think Abraham Lincoln said that
“I’ll let you be in my dreams if I can be in yours”
I said that

[Verse 1]
Early one morning the sun was shining
I was laying in bed
Wondering if she'd changed at all
If her hair was still red
Her folks they said our lives together
Sure was going to be rough
They never did like Mama's homemade dress
Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough
And I was standing on the side of the road
Rain falling on my shoes
Heading out for the East Coast
Lord knows I've paid some dues getting through
Tangled up in blue
[Verse 2]
She was married when we first met
Soon to be divorced
I helped her out of a jam, I guess
But I used a little too much force
We drove that car as far as we could
Abandoned it out West
Split up on a dark sad night
Both agreeing it was best
She turned around to look at me
As I was walking away
I heard her say over my shoulder
"We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"
Tangled up in blue
[Verse 3]
I had a job in the great north woods
Working as a cook for a spell
But I never did like it all that much
And one day the ax just fell
So I drifted down to New Orleans
Where I happened to be employed
Working for a while on a fishing boat
Right outside of Delacroix
But all the while I was alone
The past was close behind
I seen a lot of women
But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew
Tangled up in blue
[Verse 4]
She was working in a topless place
And I stopped in for a beer
I just kept looking at the side of her face
In the spotlight so clear
And later on as the crowd thinned out
I was just about to do the same
She was standing there in back of my chair
Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"
I muttered something underneath my breath
She studied the lines on my face
I must admit I felt a little uneasy
When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe
Tangled up in blue
[Verse 5]
She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe
"I thought you'd never say hello," she said
"You look like the silent type"
Then she opened up a book of poems
And handed it to me
Written by an Italian poet
From the thirteenth century
And every one of them words rang true
And glowed like 
burning coal
Pouring off of every page
Like it was written in my soul from me to you
Tangled up in blue
[Verse 6]
I lived with them on Montague Street
In a basement down the stairs
There was music in the cafes at night
And revolution in the air
Then he started into dealing with slaves
And something inside of him died
She had to sell everything she owned
And froze up inside
And when finally the bottom fell out
I became withdrawn
The only thing I knew how to do
Was to keep on keeping on like a bird that flew
Tangled up in blue
[Verse 7]
So now I'm going back again
I got to get to her somehow
All the people we used to know
They're an illusion to me now
Some are mathematicians
Some are carpenter's wives
Don't know how it all got started
I don't know what they're doing with their lives
But me, I'm still on the road
Heading for another joint
We always did feel the same
We just saw it from a different point of view
Tangled up in blue

[Verse 1]
We carried you in our arms on Independence Day
But now you'd throw us all aside and put us all away
What dear daughter 'neath the sun could love a father so
To wait upon him hand and foot and always tell him no?
[Verse 2]
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so low
And life is brief
[Verse 3]
It was all so very painless for you to run and receive
All of that false instruction we never could believe
And now the heart is filled with gold as if it was a purse
Oh, but what kind of love is this that goes from bad to worse?
[Verse 4]
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so low
And life is brief
[Verse 5]
We pointed you the way to go and scratched your name in sand
But you thought it was nothing more than a place for you to stand
I want you to know that while we watched, you discovered no one would be true
And I myself was among the ones who thought
It was just a childish thing to do
[Verse 6]
Tears of rage, tears of grief
Why must I always be the thief?
Come to me now, you know we're so low
And life is brief

[Verse 1]
The pale moon rose in its glory
Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down
[Verse 2]
T'was the 
fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold
[Verse 3]
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near
[Verse 4]
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home
[Verse 5]
The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love
[Verse 6]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
As the ballroom dancers twirled
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the underworld
[Verse 7]
Leo took his sketchbook
He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind
[Verse 8]
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap
[Verse 9]
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long
[Verse 10]
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
[Verse 11]
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around
[Verse 12]
The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside
[Verse 13]
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull
[Verse 14]
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart
[Verse 15]
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last
[Verse 16]
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done
[Verse 17]
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees
[Verse 18]
Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside
[Verse 19]
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?
[Verse 20]
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene
[Verse 21]
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere
[Verse 22]
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side
[Verse 23]
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers
[Verse 24]
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life
[Verse 25]
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark
[Verse 26]
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance
[Verse 27]
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks
[Verse 28]
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, "The poor are yours to feed"
[Verse 29]
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world
[Verse 30]
Jim Backus
 smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him
[Verse 31]
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace
[Verse 32]
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold
[Verse 33]
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had
[Verse 34]
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm
[Verse 35]
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on
[Verse 36]
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go
[Verse 37]
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before
[Verse 38]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone
[Verse 39]
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel
[Verse 40]
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race
[Verse 41]
In the 
dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears
[Verse 42]
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best
[Verse 43]
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand
[Verse 44]
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course
[Verse 45]
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea

[Verse 1]
Standing on your window, honey
Yes, I’ve been here before
Feeling so harmless
I’m looking at your second door
How come you don’t send me no regards?
You know I want your loving
Honey, why are you so hard?
[Verse 2]
Kneeling ’neath your ceiling
Yes, I guess I’ll be here for a while
I’m trying to read your portrait, but
I’m helpless, like a rich man’s child
How come you send someone out to have me barred?
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, why are you so hard?
[Bridge]
Like a poor fool in his prime
Yes, I know you can hear me walk
But is your heart made out of stone, or is it lime
Or is it just solid rock?
[Verse 3]
Well, I rush into your hallway
Lean against your velvet door
I watch upon your scorpion
Who crawls across your circus floor
Just what do you think you have to guard?
You know I want your lovin’
Honey, but you’re so hard
[Verse 4]
Achilles is in your alleyway
He don’t want me here, he does brag
He’s pointing to the sky
And he’s hungry, like a man in drag
How come you get someone like him to be your guard?
You know I want your loving
Honey, but you’re so hard

[Verse 1]
Well, Frankie Lee and 
Judas Priest
They were the best of friends
So when Frankie Lee needed money one day
Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens
And placed them on a footstool
Just above the plotted plain
Saying, “Take your pick, Frankie Boy
My loss will be your gain”
[Verse 2]
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down
And put his fingers to his chin
But with the cold eyes of Judas on him
His head began to spin
“Would ya please not stare at me like that,” he said
“It’s just my foolish pride
But sometimes a man must be alone
And this is no place to hide”
[Verse 3]
Well, Judas, he just winked and said
“All right, I’ll leave you here
But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want
Before they all disappear”
“I’m gonna start my picking right now
Just tell me where you’ll be”
Judas pointed down the road
And said, “Eternity!”
[Verse 4]
“Eternity?” said Frankie Lee
With a voice as cold as ice
“That’s right,” said Judas Priest, “Eternity
Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”
“I don’t call it anything”
Said Frankie Lee with a smile
“All right,” said Judas Priest
“I’ll see you after a while”
[Verse 5]
Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down
Feeling low and mean
When just then a passing stranger
Burst upon the scene
Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler
Whose father is deceased?
Well, if you are, there’s a fellow calling you down the road
And they say his name is Priest”
[Verse 6]
“Oh, yes, he is my friend”
Said Frankie Lee in fright
“I do recall him very well
In fact, he just left my sight”
“Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger
As quiet as a mouse
“Well, my message is, he’s down the road
Stranded in a house”
[Verse 7]
Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked
He dropped everything and ran
Until he came up to the spot
Where Judas Priest did stand
“What kind of house is this,” he said
“Where I have come to roam?”
“It’s not a house,” said Judas Priest
“It’s not a house, it’s a home”
[Verse 8]
Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled
He soon lost all control
Over ev’rything which he had made
While the mission bells did toll
He just stood there staring
At that big house as bright as any sun
With four and twenty windows
And a woman’s face in ev’ry one
[Verse 9]
Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee
With a soulful, bounding leap
And, foaming at the mouth
He began to make his midnight creep
For sixteen nights and days he raved
But on the seventeenth he burst
Into the arms of Judas Priest
Which is where he died of thirst
[Verse 10]
No one tried to say a thing
When they took him out in jest
Except, of course, the little neighbor boy
Who carried him to rest
And he just walked along, alone
With his guilt so well concealed
And muttered underneath his breath
“Nothing is revealed”
[Verse 11]
Well, the moral of the story
The moral of this song
Is simply that one should never be
Where one does not belong
So when you see your neighbor carrying something
Help him with his load
And don’t go mistaking Paradise
For that home across the road

[Verse 1]
'Twas down in Mississippi no so long ago
When a young boy from Chicago town stepped through a Southern door
This boy's dreadful tragedy I can still remember well
The color of his skin was black and his name was Emmett Till
[Verse 2]
Some men they dragged him to a barn and there they beat him up
They said they had a reason, but I can't remember what
They tortured him and did some things too evil to repeat
There was screaming sounds inside the barn, there was laughing sounds out on the street
[Verse 3]
Then they rolled his body down a gulf amidst a bloody red rain
And they threw him in the waters wide to cease his screaming pain
The reason that they killed him there, and I'm sure it ain't no lie
Was just for the fun of killing' him and to watch him slowly die
[Verse 4]
And then to stop, the United States of yelling for a trial
Two brothers they confessed that they had killed poor Emmett Till
But on the jury there were men who helped the brothers commit this awful crime
And so this trial was a mockery, but nobody there seemed to mind
[Verse 5]
I saw the morning papers but I could not bear, to see
The smiling brothers walking' down the courthouse stairs
For the jury found them innocent and the brothers they went free
While Emmett's body floats the foam of a Jim Crow southern sea
[Verse 6]
If you can't speak out against this kind of thing, a crime that's so unjust
Your eyes are filled with dead men's dirt, your 
mind is filled with dust
Your arms and legs they must
 be in shackles and chains, and your blood it must refuse to flow
For you to let this human race fall down so God-awful low!
[Verse 7]
This song's just a reminder to remind your fellow man
That this kind of thing still lives today in that ghost-robed Ku Klux Klan
But if all of us folks that thinks alike, if we gave all we could give
We could make this great land of ours a greater place to live

[Intro]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Everybody saying this is a day only the Lord could make
[Verse 1]
Well I worked on the levee Mama, both night and day
Well I worked on the levee Mama, both night and day
I got to the river and I threw my clothes away
I paid my time and now I'm as good as new
I paid my time and now I'm as good as new
They can't take me back, not unless I want them to
[Verse 2]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some of these people gonna strip you of all they can take
I can't stop here, I ain't ready to unload
I can't stop here, I ain't ready to unload
Riches and salvation can be waiting behind the next bend in the road
[Verse 3]
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get
I picked you up from the gutter and this is the thanks I get
You say you want me to quit ya, I told you no, not just yet
I look in your eyes, I see nobody else but me
I look in your eyes, I see nobody other than me
I see all that I am and all I hope to be
[Verse 4]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some of these people don't know which road to take
When I'm with you I forget I was ever blue
When I'm with you I forget I was ever blue
Without you there's no meaning in anything I do
[Verse 5]
Some people on the road carrying everything that they own
Some people on the road carrying everything that they own
Some people got barely enough skin to cover their bones
Put on your cat clothes, Mama, put on your evening dress
Put on your cat clothes, Mama, put on your evening dress
A few more years of hard work then there'll be a thousand years of happiness
[Verse 6]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
I tried to get you to love me, but I won't repeat that mistake
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Plenty of cheap stuff out there still around that you take
[Verse 7]
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I woke up this morning, butter and eggs in my bed
I ain't got enough room to even raise my head
Come back, baby, say we never more will part
Come back, baby, say we never more will part
Don't be a stranger without a brain or heart
[outro]
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
If it keeps on raining' the levee gonna break
Some people still sleeping', some people are wide awake

[Verse 1]
William Zanzinger killed poor Hattie Carroll
With a cane that he twirled around his diamond ring finger
At a Baltimore hotel society gathering
And the cops were called in and his weapon took from him
As they rode him in custody down to the station
And booked William Zanzinger for first-degree murder
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now is not the time for your tears
[Verse 2]
William Zanzinger, who at twenty-four years
Owns a tobacco farm of six hundred acres
With rich wealthy parents who provide and protect him
And high office relations in the politics of Maryland
Reacted to his deed with a shrug of his shoulders
And swear words and sneering, and his tongue it was snarling
In a matter of minutes on bail was out walking
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now is not the time for your tears
[Verse 3]
Hattie Carroll was a maid of the kitchen
She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children
Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage
And never sat once at the head of the table
And didn’t even talk to the people at the table
Who just cleaned up all the food from the table
And emptied the ashtrays on a whole other level
Got killed by a blow, lay slain by a cane
That sailed through the air and came down through the room
Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle
And she never done nothing to William Zanzinger
But you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Take the rag away from your face
Now is not the time for your tears
[Verse 4]
In the courtroom of honor, the judge pounded his gavel
To show that all’s equal and that the courts are on the level
And that the strings in the books ain’t pulled and persuaded
And that even the nobles get properly handled
Once that the cops have chased after and caught ’em
And that the ladder of law has no top and no bottom
Stared at the person who killed for no reason
Who just happened to be feeling that way without warning
And he spoke through his cloak, most deep and distinguished
And handed out strongly, for penalty and repentance
William Zanzinger with a six-month sentence
Oh, but you who philosophize disgrace and criticize all fears
Bury the rag deep in your face
For now’s the time for your tears

[Verse 1]
The man in me will do nearly any task
And as for compensation, there’s little he would ask
Take a woman like you
To get through to the man in me
[Verse 2]
Storm clouds are raging all around my door
I think to myself I might not take it anymore
Take a woman like your kind
To find the man in me
[Verse 3]
But, oh, what a wonderful feeling
Just to know that you are near
Sets my heart a
-
reeling
From my toes up to my ears
[Verse 4]
The man in me will hide sometimes to keep from bein’ seen
But that’s just because he doesn’t want to turn into some machine
Took a woman like you
To get through to the man in me

[Verse 1]
Come gather around people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimming or you’ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changing
[Verse 2]
Come writers and critics
Who prophesier with your pen
And keep your eyes wide
The chance won’t come again
And don’t speak too soon
For the wheel’s still in spin
And there’s no telling who that it’s naming
For the loser now will be later to win
[Verse 3]
Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don’t stand in the doorway
Don’t block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There’s a battle outside and it is raging
It’ll soon shake your windows and rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changing
[Verse 4]
Come mothers and fathers
Throughout the land
And don’t criticize
What you can’t understand
Your sons and your daughters
Are beyond your command
Your old road is rapidly aging
Please get out of the new one if you can’t lend your hand
[Verse 5]
The line it is drawn
The curse it is cast
The slow one now
Will later be fast
As the present now
Will later be past
The order is rapidly fading
And the first one now will later be last

[Verse 1]
Come gather around people
Wherever you roam
And admit that the waters
Around you have grown
And accept it that soon
You’ll be drenched to the bone
If your time to you is worth saving
Then you better start swimming or you’ll sink like a stone
For the times they are a-changing
[Verse 2]
Come writers and critics
Who prophesier with your pen
And keep your eyes wide

[Verse 1]
There was a wicked messenger
From Eli he did come
With a mind that multiplied the smallest matter
When questioned who had sent for him
He answered with his thumb
For his tongue it could not speak, but only flatter
[Verse 2]
He stayed behind the assembly hall
It was there he made his bed
Oftentimes he could be seen returning
Until one day he just appeared
With a note in his hand which read
“The soles of my feet, I swear they’re burning”
[Verse 3]
Oh, the leaves began to falling
And the seas began to part
And the people that confronted him were many
And he was told but these few words
Which opened up his heart
“If ye cannot bring good news, then don’t bring any”

[Verse 1]
A worried man with a worried mind
No one in front of me and nothing behind
There’s a woman on my lap and she’s drinking champagne
Got white skin, got assassin’s eyes
I’m looking up into the sapphire-tinted skies
I’m well dressed, waiting on the last train
Standing on the gallows with my head in a noose
Any minute now I’m expecting all hell to break loose
[Chorus]
People are crazy and times are strange
I’m locked in tight, I’m out of range
I used to care, but things have changed
[Verse 2]
This place ain’t doing me any good
I’m in the wrong town, I should be in Hollywood
Just for a second there I thought I saw something move
Gonna take dancing lessons, do the jitterbug rag
Ain’t no shortcuts, gonna dress in drag
Only a fool in here would think he’s got anything to prove
Lot of water under the bridge, lot of other stuff too
Don’t get up gentlemen, I’m only passing through
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I’ve been walking forty miles of bad road
If the Bible is right, the world will explode
I’ve been trying to get as far away from myself as I can
Some things are too hot to touch
The human mind can only stand so much
You can’t win with a losing hand
Feel like falling in love with the first woman I meet
Putting her in a wheelbarrow and wheeling her down the street
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
I 
hurt easy, I just don’t show it
You can hurt someone and not even know it
The next sixty seconds could be like an eternity
Gonna get low down, gonna fly high
All the truth in the world adds up to one big lie
I’m in love with a woman who don’t even appeal to me
Mr. Jinx and Miss Lucy, they jumped in the lake
I’m not that eager to make a mistake
[Chorus]

[Chorus] [x2]
This land is your land, this land is my land
From California, to the New York Island
From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters
This land was made for you and me
As I was walking a ribbon of highway
I saw above me an endless Skyway
I saw below me a golden valley
This land was made for you and me
[Verse 1]
I've roamed and rambled and I've followed my footsteps
To the sparkling sands of her diamond deserts
And all around me a voice was sounding
This land was made for you and me
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
The sun comes shining as I was strolling
The wheat fields waving and the dust clouds rolling
The fog was lifting a voice come chanting
This land was made for you and me
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
As I was walking - I saw a sign there
And that sign said - no tress passing
But on the other side. It didn't say nothing!
Now that side was made for you and me!
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple
Near the relief office - I see my people
And some are grumbling and some are wondering
If this land's still made for you and me
[Chorus] [x2]

[Verse 1]
If your memory serves you well
We were going to meet again and wait
So I’m going to unpack all my things
And sit before it gets too late
No man alive will come to you
With another tale to tell
But you know that we shall meet again
If your memory serves you well
[Chorus]
This wheel’s on fire
Rolling down the road
Best notify my next of kin
This wheel shall explode!
[Verse 2]
If your memory serves you well
I was going to confiscate your lace
And wrap it up in a sailor’s knot
And hide it in your case
If I knew for sure that it was yours
But it was oh so hard to tell
But you knew that we would meet again
If your memory serves you well
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
If your memory serves you well
You’ll remember you’re the one
That called on me to call on them
To get you your favors done
And after ev’ry plan had failed
And there was nothing more to tell
You knew that we would meet again
If your memory served you well
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Thunder on the mountain, fires on the moon
There's a ruckus in the alley and the sun will be here soon
Today's the day, gonna grab my trombone and blow
Well, there's hot stuff here and it's everywhere I go
[Verse 2]
I was thinking' 'bout Alicia Keys, couldn't keep from crying
When she was born in Hell's Kitchen, I was living down the line
I'm wondering where in the world Alicia Keys could be
I have been looking for her even clear through Tennessee
[Verse 3]
Feel like my soul is beginning to expand
Look into my heart and you will sort of understand
You brought me here, now you're trying to run me away
The writing's on the wall, come read it, come see what it say
[Verse 4]
Thunder on the mountain, rolling like a drum
Gonna sleep over there, that's where the music coming from
I don't need any guide, I already know the way
Remember this, I'm your servant both night and day
[Verse 5]
The pistols are poppin' and the power is down
I'd like to try something' but I'm so far from town
The sun keeps shining' and the North Wind keeps picking up speed
Gonna forget about myself for a while, gonna go out and see what others need
[Verse 6]
I've been sitting down studying the art of love
I think it will fit me like a glove
I want some real good woman to do just what I say
Everybody got to wonder what's the matter with this cruel world today
[Verse 7]
Thunder on the mountain rolling to the ground
Gonna get up in the morning walk the hard road down
Some sweet day I'll stand beside my king
I wouldn't betray your love or any other thing
[Verse 8]
Gonna raise me an army, some tough sons of bitches
I'll recruit my army from the orphanages
I been to St. Herman's church and I've said my religious vows
I've sucked the milk out of a thousand cows
[Verse 9]
I got the porkchops, she got the pie
She ain't no angel and neither am I
Shame on your greed, shame on your wicked schemes
I'll say this, I don't give a damn about your dreams
[Verse 10]
Thunder on the mountain heavy as can be
Mean old twister bearing down on me
All the ladies of Washington scrambling to get out of town
Looks like something bad gonna happen, better roll your airplane down
[Verse 11]
Everybody's going and I want to go too
Don't wanna take a chance with somebody new
I did all I could and I did it right there and then
I've already confessed – no need to confess again
[Verse 12]
Gonna make a lot of money, gonna go up north
I'll plant and I'll harvest what the earth brings forth
The hammer's on the table, the pitchfork's on the shelf
For the love of God, you ought to take pity on yourself

[Verse set 1]
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days and the summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs out in the mud
I got a house on a hill, I got hogs all out in the mud
Got a long-haired woman, she got royal Indian blood
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Everybody get ready to lift up your glasses and sing
Well, I’m standing on the table, I’m proposing a toast to the king
[Chorus]
Well I’m driving in the flats in a Cadillac car
The girls all say, “You’re a worn-out star”
My pockets are loaded and I’m spending every dime
How can you say you love someone else when you know it’s me all the time?
[Verse 2]
Well, the fog’s so thick you can’t spy the land
The fog is so thick that you can’t even spy the land
What good are you anyway, if you can’t stand up to some old businessman?
Wedding bells are ringing, the choir is beginning to sing
Yes, the wedding bells are ringing and the choir's beginning to sing
What looked good in the day, at night is another thing
She’s looking into my eyes, she’s-a holding my hand
She looking into my eyes, she’s holding my hand
She said, “You can’t repeat the past,” I said, “You can’t? What do you mean
You can’t? Of course you can.”
[Chorus]
Where do you come from? Where do you go?
Sorry that’s nothing you would need to know
Well, my back has been to the wall for so long, it seems like it’s stuck
Why don’t you break my heart one more time just for good luck?
[Verse 3]
I got eight carburetors, boys I’m using ’em all
Well, I got eight carburetors and boys, I’m using ’em all
I’m short on gas, my motor’s starting to stall
My dogs are barking, there must be someone around
My dogs are barking, 
there's
 must be someone around
I got my hammer ringing, pretty baby, but the nails ain’t going down
You got something to say, speak or hold your peace
Well, you got something to say, speak now or hold your peace
If it’s information you want you can go get it from the police
[Chorus]
Politician's got on his jogging shoes
He must be running for office, got no time to lose
He's sucking the blood out of the genius of generosity
You been rolling your eyes—you been teasing me
[Verse 4]
Standing by God’s river, 
my soul is beginning to shake
Standing by God’s river, my soul is beginning to shake
I’m counting on you love, to give me a break
Well, I’m leaving in the morning as soon as the dark clouds lift
Yes, I’m leaving in the morning just as soon as the dark clouds lift
Gonn' break the roof in—set fire to the place as a parting gift
Summer days, summer nights are gone
Summer days, summer nights are gone
I know a place where there’s still something going on

[Verse 1]
The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course
The city fathers they’re trying to endorse
The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse
But the town has no need to be nervous
The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits
To Jezebel the nun she violently knits
A bald wig for
 
Jack the Ripper who sits
At the head of the chamber of commerce
[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She has got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s looking for food
I’m in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues
[Verse 2]
The hysterical bride in the penny arcade
Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”
Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade
Says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”
Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside
He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride
“Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride
You will not die, it’s not poison”
[Chorus]
Mama’s in the factory
She has got no shoes
Daddy’s in the alley
He’s looking for food
I’m in the kitchen
With the tombstone blues
[Verse 3]
Well, John the Baptist after torturing a thief
Looks up at his hero, the 
Commander
-in-Chief
Saying, “
Tell me great hero, but please make it brief
Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”
The Commander-in-Chief answers him while chasing a fly
Saying, "Death to all those who would whimper and cry"
And dropping a barbell he points to the sky
Saying, “The sun’s not yellow, it’s chicken”
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save
Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves
Puts the pied pipers in prison
 
and fattens the slaves
Then sends them out to the jungle
Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps
With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps
With a fantastic collection of stamps
To win friends and influence his uncle
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
The geometry of innocence, flesh on the bone
Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown
At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone
But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter
Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill
I would set him in chains at the top of the hill
Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille
He could die happily ever after
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll
Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole
And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul
To the old folks home and the college
Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain
That could hold you dear lady from going insane
That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain
Of your useless and pointless knowledge
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
If today was not an endless highway
If tonight was not a crooked trail
If tomorrow wasn’t such a long time
Then lonesome would mean nothing to you at all
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again
[Verse 2]
I can’t see my reflection in the waters
I can’t speak the sounds that show no pain
I can’t hear the echo of my footsteps
Or can’t remember the sound of my own name
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once 
again
[Verse 3]
There’s beauty in the silver, singing river
There’s beauty in the sunrise in the sky
But none of these and nothing else can touch the beauty
That I remember in my true love’s eyes
Yes, and only if my own true love was waiting
Yes, and if I could hear her heart a-softly pounding
Only if she was lying by me
Then I’d lie in my bed once again

[Verse 1]
Ramona
Come closer
Shut softly your watery eyes
The pangs of your sadness
Shall pass as your senses will rise
The flowers of the city
Though breath like
Get deathlike at times
And there’s no use in trying
To deal with the dying
Though I cannot explain that in lines
[Verse 2]
Your cracked country lips
I still wish to kiss
As to be by the strength of your skin
Your magnetic movements
Still capture the minutes I’m in
But it grieves my heart, love
To see you trying to be a part of
A world that just don’t exist
It’s all just a dream, babe
A vacuum, a scheme, babe
That sucks you into feeling like this
[Verse 3]
I can see that your head
Has been twisted and fed
By worthless foam from the mouth
I can tell you are torn
Between staying and returning
On back to the South
You’ve been fooled into thinking
That the finishing end is at hand
Yet there’s no one to beat you
No one to defeat you
Except the thoughts of yourself feeling bad
[Verse 4]
I’ve heard you say many times
That you’re better than no one
And no one is better than you
If you really believe that
You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose
From fixtures and forces and friends
Your sorrow does stem
That hype you and type you
Making you feel
That you got to be just like them
[Verse 5]
I’d forever talk to you
But soon my words
Would turn into a meaningless ring
For deep in my heart
I know there is no help I can bring
Everything passes
Everything changes
Just do what you think you should do
And someday maybe
Who knows, baby
I’ll come and be crying to you

[Verse 1]
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do the things that only you know best
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to do what’s right and not be second-guessed
Don’t trust me to show you beauty
When beauty may only turn to rust
If you need somebody you can trust, trust yourself
[Verse 2]
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to know the way that will prove true in the end
Trust yourself
Trust yourself to find the path where there is no if and when
Don’t trust me to show you the truth
When the truth may only be ashes and dust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself
[Verse 3]
Well, you’re on your own, you always were
In a land of wolves and thieves
Don’t put your hope in ungodly man
Or be a slave to what somebody else believes
[Verse 4]
Trust yourself
And you won’t be disappointed when vain people let you down
Trust yourself
And look not for answers where no answers can be found
Don’t trust me to show you love
When my love may be only lust
If you want somebody you can trust, trust yourself

[Verse 1]
The air is getting hotter
There’s a rumbling in the skies
I’ve been wading through the high muddy water
With the heat rising in my eyes
Every day your memory grows dimmer
It doesn’t haunt me like it did before
I’ve been walking through the middle of nowhere
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
[Verse 2]
When I was in Missouri
They would not let me be
I had to leave there in a hurry
I only saw what they let me see
You broke a heart that loved you
Now you can seal up the book and not write anymore
I’ve been walking that lonesome valley
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
[Verse 3]
People on the platforms
Waiting for the trains
I can hear their hearts a-beatin’
Like pendulums swinging on chains
I tried to give you everything
That your heart was longing for
I’m just going down the road feeling bad
Trying to get to heaven before they close the door
[Verse 4]
I’m going down the river
Down to New Orleans
They tell me everything is gonna be all right
But I don’t know what “all right” even means
I was riding in a buggy with Miss Mary-Jane
Miss Mary-Jane got a house in Baltimore
I been all around the world, boys
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door
[Verse 5]
Gonna sleep down in the parlor
And relive my dreams
I’ll close my eyes and I wonder
If everything is as hollow as it seems
Some trains don't pull no gamblers
No midnight ramblers like they did before
I been to Sugar Town, I shook the sugar down
Now I’m trying to get to heaven before they close the door

Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They’re throwing knives into the tree
Two big bags of dead man’s bones
Got their noses to the grindstones
Living in the Land of Nod
Trustin’ their fate to the Hands of God
They pass by so silently
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well, they’re going to the country, they’re gonna retire
They’re taking a street car named Desire
Looking in the window at the pecan pie
Lot of things they’d like they would never buy
Neither one gonna turn and run
They’re making a voyage to the sun
“His Master’s voice is calling me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
Tweedle-dee Dee and Tweedle-dee Dum
All that and more and then some
They walk among the stately trees
They know the secrets of the breeze
Tweedle-dee Dum said to Tweedle-dee Dee
“Your presence is obnoxious to me”
They’re like babies sittin’ on a woman’s knee
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well, the rain beating down on my window pane
I got love for you and it’s all in vain
Brains in the pot, they’re beginning to boil
They’re dripping with garlic and olive oil
Tweedle-dee Dee—he’s on his hands and his knees
Saying, “Throw me somethin’, Mister, please”
“What’s good for you is good for me”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee
Well, they’re living in a happy harmony
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
They’re one day older and a dollar short
They’ve got a parade permit and a police escort
They’re lying low and they’re makin’ hay
They seem determined to go all the way
They run a brick-and-tile company
Tweedle-dee Dum and Tweedle-dee Dee
Well a childish dream is a deathless need
And a noble truth is a sacred dream
My pretty baby, she’s lookin’ around
She’s wearin’ a multi-thousand dollar gown
Tweedle-dee Dee is a lowdown, sorry old man
Tweedle-dee Dum, he’ll stab you where you stand
“I’ve had too much of your company,”
Says Tweedle-dee Dum to Tweedle-dee Dee

[Verse 1]
Ain't it just like the night to play tricks when you're trying to be so quiet ?
We sit here stranded, though we're all doing our best to deny it
And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it
Lights flicker from the opposite loft
In this room the 
heat pipes just cough
The country music station plays soft
But there's 
nothing really nothing to turn off
Just 
Louise
 and 
her lover
 so entwined
And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind
[Verse 2]
In the empty lot
 where the ladies play 
blind man's bluff
 
with the key chain
And the all-night girls they whisper of escapades
 out on 
the D-train
We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight
Ask himself if it's him or them that's really insane
Louise she's all right she's just near
She's delicate and seems like veneer
But she just makes it all too concise and too clear
That Johanna's not here
The ghost of electricity howls in the bones of her face
Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place
[Verse 3]
Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously
He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously
And when bringing 
her
 name up
He speaks of a farewell kiss to me
He's sure got a lot of gall to be so useless and all
Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall
Oh, how can I explain ?
It's so 
hard to get on
And these visions of Johanna they kept me up past the dawn
[Verse 4]
Inside the museums, 
Infinity goes up on trial
Voices echo, "this is what salvation must be like after a while"
But 
Mona Lisa must have had the highway blues
You can tell by the way she smiles
See the 
primitive wallflower freeze
When the jelly-faced women all sneeze
Hear the one with the mustache say, "Jeez
I can't find my knees"
Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule
But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel
[Verse 5]
The peddler now speaks to the countess who's pretending to care for him
Saying, 
"Name me someone that's not a parasite
And I'll go out and say a prayer for him"
But like Louise always says
"You can't look at much, can yo man "
As she, herself prepares for him
And Madonna, she still has not showed
We see this empty cage now corrode
Where her cape of the stage once had flowed
The fiddler, he now steps to the road
He writes everything's been returned which was owed
On the back of the fish truck that loads
While my conscience explodes
The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain
And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain

There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need
[Chorus]
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and 
me
Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stones to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand
[Chorus]
When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Let us realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as one
[Chorus: x2]
Thank you

[Verse 1]
What good am I if I’m like all the rest
If I just turn away, when I see how you’re dressed
If I shut myself off so I can’t hear you cry
What good am I?
[Verse 2]
What good am I if I know and don’t do
If I see and don’t say, if I look right through you
If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky
What good am I?
[Verse 3]
What good am I while you softly weep
And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep
And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don’t try
What good am I?
[Verse 4]
What good am I then to others and me
If I’ve had every chance and yet still fail to see
If my hands are tied must I not wonder within
Who tied them and why and where must I have been?
[Verse 5]
What good am I if I say foolish things
And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings
And I just turn my back while you silently die
What good am I?

[Verse 1]
Oh, the streets of Rome are filled with rubble
Ancient footprints are everywhere
You can almost think that you’re seeing double
On a cold, dark night on the Spanish Stairs
Got to hurry on back to my hotel room
Where I’ve got me a date with Botticelli’s niece
She promised that she’d be right there with me
When I paint my masterpiece
[Verse 2]
Oh, the hours I’ve spent inside the Coliseum
Dodging lions and wasting time
Oh, those mighty kings of the jungle, I could hardly stand to see them
Yes, it sure has been a long, hard climb
Train wheels running through the back of my memory
When I ran on the hilltop following a pack of wild geese
Someday, everything is going to be smooth like a rhapsody
When I paint my masterpiece
Sailing round the world in a dirty gondola
Oh, to be back in the land of Coca-Cola!
[Verse 3]
I left Rome and landed in Brussels
On a plane ride so bumpy that I almost cried
Clergymen in 
uniform
 and young girls pulling muscles
Everyone was there to greet me when I stepped inside
Newspapermen eating candy
Had to be held down by big police
Someday, everything is going to be different
When I paint my masterpiece

[Verse 1]
Look out across the fields, see me returning
Smoke is in your eye, you draw a smile
From the fireplace where my letters to you are burning
You’ve had time to think about it for a while
[Verse 2]
Well, I’ve walked two hundred miles, now look me over
It’s the end of the chase and the moon is high
It won’t matter who loves who
You’ll love me or I’ll love you
When the night comes falling from the sky
[Verse 3]
I can see through your walls and I know you’re hurting
Sorrow covers you up like a cape
Only yesterday I know that you’ve been flirting
With disaster that you managed to escape
[Verse 4]
I can’t provide for you no easy answers
Who are you that I should have to lie?
You’ll know all about it, love
It’ll fit you like a glove
When the night comes falling from the sky
[Verse 5]
I can hear your trembling heart beat like a river
You must have been protecting someone last time I called
I’ve never asked you for nothing you couldn’t deliver
I’ve never asked you to set yourself up for a fall
[Verse 6]
I saw thousands who could have overcome the darkness
For the love of a lousy buck, I’ve watched them die
Stick around, baby, we’re not through
Don’t look for me, I’ll see you
When the night comes falling from the sky
[Verse 7]
In your teardrops, I can see my own reflection
It was on the northern border of Texas where I crossed the line
I don’t want to be a fool starving for affection
I don’t want to drown in someone else’s wine
[Verse 8]
For all eternity I think I will remember
That icy wind that’s howling in your eye
You will seek me and you’ll find me
In the wasteland of your mind
When the night comes falling from the sky
[Verse 9]
Well, I sent you my feelings in a letter
But you were gambling for support
This time tomorrow I’ll know you better
When my memory is not so short
[Verse 10]
This time I’m asking for freedom
Freedom from a world which you deny
And you’ll give it to me now
I’ll take it anyhow
When the night comes falling from the sky

[Verse 1]
Oh the time will come up
When the winds will stop
And the breeze will cease to be breathing
Like the stillness in the wind
Before the hurricane begins
The hour when the ship comes in
[Verse 2]
Oh the seas will split
And the ship will hit
And the sands on the shoreline will be shaking
Then the tide will sound
And the wind will pound
And the morning will be breaking
[Verse 3]
Oh the fishes will laugh
As they swim out of the path
And the seagulls they’ll be smiling
And the rocks on the sand
Will proudly stand
The hour that the ship comes in
[Verse 4]
And the words that are used
For to get the ship confused
Will not be understood as they’re spoken
For the chains of the sea
Will have busted in the night
And will be buried at the bottom of the ocean
[Verse 5]
A song will lift
As the mainsail shifts
And the boat drifts on to the shoreline
And the sun will respect
Every face on the deck
The hour that the ship comes in
[Verse 6]
Then the sands will roll
Out a carpet of gold
For your weary toes to be a-touching
And the ship’s wise men
Will remind you once again
That the whole wide world is watching
[Verse 7]
Oh the foes will rise
With the sleep still in their eyes
And they’ll jerk from their beds and think they’re dreaming
But they’ll pinch themselves and squeal
And know that it’s for real
The hour when the ship comes in
[Verse 8]
Then they’ll raise their hands
Saying we’ll meet all your demands
But we’ll shout from the bow your days are numbered
And like Pharoah’s tribe
They’ll be drowned in the tide
And like Goliath, they’ll be conquered

[Chorus]
Who killed Davey Moore
Why and what’s the reason for?
[Verse 1]
“Not I,” says the referee
“Don’t point your finger at me
I could’ve stopped it in the eighth
And maybe kept him from his fate
But the crowd would’ve booed, I’m sure
At not getting their money’s worth
It’s too bad he had to go
But there was a pressure on me too, you know
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
“Not us,” says the angry crowd
Whose screams filled the arena loud
“It’s too bad he died that night
But we just like to see a fight
We didn’t mean for him to meet his death
We just meant to see some sweat
There is nothing wrong in that
It wasn’t us that made him fall
No, you can’t blame us at all”
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
“Not me,” says his manager
Puffing on a big cigar
“It’s hard to say, it’s hard to tell
I always thought that he was well
It’s too bad for his wife an’ kids he’s dead
But if he was sick, he should’ve said
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
“Not me,” says the gambling man
With his ticket stub still in his hand
“It wasn’t me that knocked him down
My hands never touched him none
I didn’t commit no ugly sin
Anyway, I put money on him to win
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
“Not me,” says the boxing writer
Pounding print on his old typewriter
Saying, “Boxing is not to blame
There’s just as much danger in a football game”
Saying, “Fist fighting is here to stay
It’s just the old American way
It wasn’t me that made him fall
No, you can’t blame me at all”
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
“Not me,” says the man whose fists
Laid him low in a cloud of mist
Who came here from Cuba’s door
Where boxing is not allowed no more
“I hit him, yes, it’s true
But that’s what I am paid to do
Don’t say ‘murder,’ don’t say ‘kill’
It was destiny, it was God’s will”
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Oh my name it is nothing
My age it means less
The country I come from
Is called the Midwest
I’s taught and brought up there
The laws to abide
And that the land that I live in
Has God on its side
[Verse 2]
Oh the history books tell it
They tell it so well
The cavalries charged
The Indians fell
The cavalries charged
The Indians died
Oh the country was young
With God on its side
[Verse 3]
Oh the Spanish-American
War had its day
And the Civil War too
Was soon laid away
And the names of the heroes
I’s made to memorize
With guns in their hands
And God on their side
[Verse 4]
Oh the First World War, boys
It closed out its fate
The reason for fighting
I never got straight
But I learned to accept it
Accept it with pride
For you don’t count the dead
When God’s on your side
[Verse 5]
When the Second World War
Came to an end
We forgave the Germans
And we were friends
Though they murdered six million
In the ovens they fried
The Germans now too
Have God on their side
[Verse 6]
I’ve learned to hate Russians
All through my whole life
If another war starts
It’s them we must fight
To hate them and fear them
To run and to hide
And accept it all bravely
With God on my side
[Verse 7]
But now we got weapons
Of the chemical dust
If fire them we’re forced to
Then fire them we must
One push of the button
And a shot the world wide
And you never ask questions
When God’s on your side
[Verse 8]
Through many dark hour
I’ve been thinking about this
That Jesus Christ
Was betrayed by a kiss
But I can’t think for you
You’ll have to decide
Whether Judas Iscariot
Had God on his side
[Verse 9]
So now as I’m leaving
I’m weary as Hell
The confusion I’m feeling
I am no tongue can tell
The words fill my head
And fall to the floor
If God’s on our side
He’ll stop the next war

[Verse 1]
There's an evening' haze settlin' over the town
Starlight by the edge of the creek
The buyin' power of the proletariat's gone down
Money's gettin' shallow and weak
The place I love best is a sweet memory
It's a new path that we trod
They say low wages are a reality
If we want to compete abroad
[Verse 2]
My cruel weapons have been put on the shelf
Come sit down on my knee
You are dearer to me than myself
As you yourself can see
I'm listening' to the steel rails hum
Got both eyes tight shut
Just sitting here trying to keep the hunger from
Creeping it's way into my gut
[Chorus]
Meet me at the bottom, don't lag behind
Bring me my boots and shoes
You can hang back or fight your best on the front line
Sing a little bit of these workingman's blues
[Verse 3]
Now, I'm sailing' on back, ready for the long haul
Tossed by the winds and the seas
I'll drag them all down to hell and I'll stand them at the wall
I'll sell them to their enemies
I'm trying' to feed my soul with thought
Gonna sleep off the rest of the day
Sometimes no one wants what we got
Sometimes you can't give it away
[Verse 4]
Now the place is ringed with countless foes
Some of them may be deaf and dumb
No man, no woman knows
The hour that sorrow will come
In the dark I hear the night birds call
I can hear a lover's breath
I sleep in the kitchen with my feet in the hall
Sleep is like a temporary death
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Well, they burned my barn, they stole my horse
I can't save a dime
I got to be careful, I don't want to be forced
Into a life of continual crime
I can see for myself that the sun is sinking
How I wish you were here to see
Tell me now, am I wrong in thinking
That you have forgotten me?
[Verse 6]
Now they worry and they hurry and they fuss and they fret
They waste your nights and days
Them I will forget
But you I'll remember always
Old memories of you to me have clung
You've wounded me with words
Gonna have to straighten out your tongue
It's all true, everything you have heard
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
In you, my friend, I find no blame
Wanna look in my eyes, please do
No one can ever claim
That I took up arms against you
All across the peaceful sacred fields
They will lay you low
They'll break your horns and slash you with steel
I say it so it must be so
[Verse 8]
Now I'm down on my luck and I'm black and blue
Gonna give you another chance
I'm all alone and I'm expecting you
To lead me off in a cheerful dance
Got a brand new suit and a brand new wife
I can live on rice and beans
Some people never worked a day in their life
Don't know what work even means
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Clouds so swift
Rain won’t lift
Gate won’t close
Railings froze
Get your mind off wintertime
You ain’t going nowhere
[Chorus]
Whoo-ee! Ride me high
Tomorrow’s the day
My bride’s going to come
Oh, oh, are we going to fly
Down in the easy chair!
[Verse 2]
I don’t care
How many letters they sent
Morning came and morning went
Pick up your money
And pack up your tent
You ain’t going nowhere
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Buy me a flute
And a gun that shoots
Tailgates and substitutes
Strap yourself
To the tree with roots
You ain’t going nowhere
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Genghis Khan
He could not keep
All his kings
Supplied with sleep
We’ll climb that hill no matter how steep
When we get up to it
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Our conversation was short and sweet
It nearly swept me off-a my feet
And I'm back in the rain, oh, oh
And you are on dry land
You made it there somehow
You're a big girl now
[Verse 2]
Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence
He's singing his song for me at his own expense
And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh
Singing just for you
I hope that you can hear
Hear me singing through these tears
[Verse 3]
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast
Oh, but what a shame if all we've shared can't last
I can change, I swear, oh, oh
See what you can do
I can make it through
You can make it too
[Verse 4]
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase
You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days
Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh
In somebody's room
It's a price I have to pay
You're a big girl all the way
[Verse 5]
A change in the weather is known to be extreme
But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?
I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh
With a pain that stops and starts
Like a corkscrew to my heart
Ever since we've been apart

[Verse 1]
I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
[Verse 2]
Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It’s always hit me from below
This time around it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
[Verse 3]
Purple clover, Queen Anne’s Lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go
[Verse 4]
Flowers on the hillside, blooming crazy
Crickets talkin’ back and forth in rhyme
Blue river runnin’ slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time
[Verse 5]
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go
[Verse 6]
Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m doing
Staying’ far behind without you
Yer gonna make me wonder what I’m saying
Yer gonna make me give myself a good talking to
[Verse 7]
I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco, Ashtabula
Yer gonna have to leave me now, I know
But I’ll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
Yer gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Intro]
Ten thousand men on a hill
Ten thousand men on a hill
Some of ’m going’ down, some of ’m gonna get killed
[Verse 1]
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Ten thousand men dressed in Oxford blue
Drumming in the morning, in the evening they’ll be coming for you
[Verse 2]
Ten thousand men on the move
Ten thousand men on the move
None of them doing nothin’ that your mama wouldn’t disapprove
[Verse 3]
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
Ten thousand men digging for silver and gold
All clean shaven, all coming in from the cold
[Verse 4]
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Hey! Who could your lover be?
Let me eat off his head so you can really see!
[Verse 5]
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Ten thousand women all dressed in white
Standing at my window wishing me Goodnight
[Verse 6]
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Ten thousand men looking so lean and frail
Each one of ’m got seven wives, each one of ’m just out of jail
[Verse 7]
Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room
Ten thousand women all sweepin’ my room
Spilling my buttermilk, sweeping it up with a broom
[Outro]
Ooh, baby, thank you for my tea!
Baby, thank you for my tea!
It’s so sweet of you to be so nice to me

[Intro]
One by one, they followed the sun
One by one, until there were none
Two by two, to their lovers they flew
Two by two, into the foggy dew
Three by three, they danced on the sea
Four by four, they danced on the shore
Five by five, they tried to survive
Six by six, they were playing with tricks
[Verse 1]
How many paths did they try and fail?
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail?
How much poison did they inhale?
How many black cats crossed their trail?
[Verse 2]
Seven by seven, they headed for heaven
Eight by eight, they got to the gate
Nine by nine, they drank the wine
Ten by ten, they drank it again
[Verse 3]
How many tomorrows have they given away?
How many compared to yesterday?
How many more without any reward?
How many more can they afford?
[Verse 4]
Two by two, they stepped into the ark
Two by two, they step in the dark
Three by three, they’re turning the key
Four by four, they turn it some more
[Outro]
One by one, they follow the sun
Two by two, to another rendezvous

[Verse 1]
Now and then there's a fool such as I
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, I will dream a little dream as years go by
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
[Verse 2]
Now and then there's a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you happened to be untrue
I am a fool but I love you, dear, yes I will until the day I die
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
[Verse 3]
Pardon me if I'm sentimental, came to say goodbye
Don't be angry, don't be angry with me, should I cry
When you are gone, when you are gone, I will dream a little
I will dream as years go by
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
[Verse 4]
Now and then there's a fool, a fool such as I am over you
You taught me how to love and now you say that we are through
I am a fool, yes, but I love you dear, I will love you dear
Till the day, till the day I die
Now and then, now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I
Now and then there is a fool, a fool such as I

[Chorus]
Well, I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more
Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more
Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more, no more
And ain’t a-gonna grieve no more
[Verse 1]
Come on brothers, join the band
Come on sisters, clap your hands
Tell everybody that’s in the land
You ain’t a-gonna grieve no more
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
Brown and blue and white and black
All one color on the one-way track
We got this far and ain’t a-goin’ back
And I ain’t a-gonna grieve no more
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
We’re gonna notify your next of kin
You’re gonna raise the roof until the house falls in
If you get knocked down get up again
We ain’t a-gonna grieve no more
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
We’ll sing this song all night long
Sing it to my baby from midnight on
She’ll sing it to you when I’m dead and gone
Ain’t a-gonna grieve no more
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low
[Verse 2]
Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what's on your mind
[Verse 3]
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
[Verse 4]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold

I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'd only let your hair hang low

Alberta what's on your mind
Alberta what's on your mind
You keep me worried and bothered
All of the time
Alberta what's on your mind
[Verse 3]
Alberta don't you treat me unkind

Oh my heart is so sad
Cause I want you so bad
Alberta don't you treat me unkind
[Verse 4]
Alberta let your hair hang low
Alberta let your hair hang low
I'll give you more gold
Than your apron can hold
If you'll only let your hair hang low

[Verse 1]
I am not looking to compete with you
Beat or cheat or mistreat you
Simplify you, classify you
Deny, defy or crucify you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
[Verse 2]
No, and I am not looking to fight with you
Frighten you or tighten you
Drag you down or drain you down
Chain you down or bring you down
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
[Verse 3]
I am not looking to block you up
Shock or knock or lock you up
Analyze you, categorize you
Finalize you or advertise you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
[Verse 4]
I don’t want to straight-face you
Race or chase you, track or trace you
Or disgrace you or displace you
Or define you or confine you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
[Verse 5]
I don’t want to meet your kin
Make you spin or do you in
Or select you or dissect you
Or inspect you or reject you
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you
[Verse 6]
I don’t want to fake you out
Take or shake or forsake you out
I am not looking for you to feel like me
See like me or be like me
All I really want to do
Is, baby, be friends with you

[Verse 1]
Well, if I had to do it all over again
Babe, I’d do it all over you
And if I had to wait for ten thousand years
Babe, I’d even do that too
Well, a dog’s got his bone in the alley
A cat, she’s got nine lives
A millionaire’s got a million dollars
King Saud’s got four hundred wives
Well, ev’rybody’s got somethin’
That they’re looking’ forward to
I’m looking’ forward to when I can do it all again
And babe, I’ll do it all over you
[Verse 2]
Well, if I had my way tomorrow or today
Babe, I’d run circles all around
I’d jump up in the wind, do a somersault and spin
I’d even dance a jig on the ground
Well, everybody gets their hour
Everybody gets their time
Little David when he picked up his pebbles
Even Sampson after he went blind
Well, everybody gets the chance
To do what they want to do
When my time arrives you better run for your life
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you
[Verse 3]
Well, I don’t need no money, I just need a day that’s sunny
Baby, and my days are gonna come
And I grab me a pint, you know that I’m a giant
When you hear me yelling’, “Fee-fi-fo-fum”
Well, you cut me like a jigsaw puzzle
You made me to a walk-in’ wreck
Then you pushed my heart through my backbone
Then you knocked off my head from my neck
Well, if I’m ever stand-in’ steady
A-doin’ what I want to do
Well, I tell you little lover that you better run for cover
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you
[Verse 4]
I’m just resting’ at your gate so that I won’t be late
And, momma, I’m a-just sitting’ on the shelf
Look out your window fair and you’ll see me squatting’ there
Just a-fumblin’ and a-mumbling’ to myself
Well, after my cigarette’s been smoked up
After all my liquor’s been drunk
After my dreams are dreamed out
After all my thoughts have been sunk
Well, after I do some of these things
I’m gonna do what I have to do
And I tell you on the side, that you better run and hide
’Cause babe, I’ll do it all over you

All the tired horses in the sun
How'm I supposed to get any riding done? Hmm

[Verse 1]
It was late last night when the boss came home
To a deserted mansion and a desolate throne
Servant said: “Boss, the lady’s gone
She left this morning just ‘fore dawn.”
[Verse 2]
“You got something to tell me, tell it to me, man
Come to the point as straight as you can”
“Old Henry Lee, chief of the clan
Came riding through the woods and took her by the hand”
[Verse 3]
The boss he lay back flat on his bed
He cursed the heat and he clutched his head
He pondered the future of his fate
To wait another day would be far too late
[Verse 4]
“Go fetch me my coat and my tie
And the cheapest labour that money can buy
Saddle me up my buckskin mare
If you see me go by, put up a prayer” (The Boss)
[Verse 5]
Well, they rode all night, and they rode all day
Eastward, long down the broad highway
His spirit was tired and his vision was bent
His men deserted him and onward he went
[Verse 6]
He came to a place where the light was dull
His forehead pounding in his skull
Heavy heart was racked with pain
Insomnia raging in his brain
[Verse 7]
Well, he threw down his helmet and his cross-handled sword
He renounced his faith, he denied his lord
Crawled on his belly, put his ear to the wall
One way or another put an end to it all
[Verse 8]
He leaned down, cut the electric wire
Stared into the flames and he snorted the fire
Peered through the darkness, caught a glimpse of the two
It was hard to tell for certain who was who
[Verse 9]
He lowered himself down on a golden chain
His nerves were quaking in every vein
His knuckles were bloody, he sucked in the air
He ran his fingers through his greasy hair
[Verse 10]
They looked at each other and their glasses clinked
One single unit, inseparably linked
“Got a strange premonition there’s a man close by” (Henry Lee)
“Don’t worry about him, he wouldn’t harm a fly” (The Wife)
[Verse 11]
From behind the curtain, the boss he crossed the floor
He moved his feet and he bolted the door
Shadows hiding the lines in his face
With all the nobility of an ancient race
[Verse 12]
She turned, she was startled with a look of surprise
With a hatred that could hit the skies
“You’re a reckless fool, I could see it in your eyes
To come this way was by 
no means wise
” (The Wife)
[Verse 13]
“Get up, stand up, you greedy-lipped wench
And cover your face or suffer the consequence
You are making my heart feel sick
Put your clothes back on, double-quick” (The Boss)
[Verse 14]
“Silly boy, you think me a saint
I’ll listen no more to your words of complaint
You’ve given me nothing but the sweetest lies
Now hold your tongue and feed your eyes” (The Wife)
[Verse 15]
“I’d have given you the stars and the planets, too
But what good would these things do you?
Bow the heart if not the knee
Or never again this world you’ll see” (The Boss)
[Verse 16]
“Oh, please let not your heart be cold
This man is dearer to me than gold” (The Wife)
“Oh, my dear, you must be blind
He’s a gutless ape with a worthless mind” (The Boss)
[Verse 17]
“You’ve had your way too long with me
Now it’s me who’ll determine how things shall be” (The Wife)
“Try to escape,” he cussed and cursed
‘You’ll have to try to get past me first” (The Boss)
[Verse 18]
“Do not let your passion rule
You think my heart the heart of a fool
And you, sir, you can not deny
You made a monkey of me, what and for why?” (The Boss)
[Verse 19]
“I’ll have no more of this insulting chat
The devil can have you, I’ll see to that
Look sharp or step aside
Or in the cradle you’ll wish you’d died” (Henry Lee)
[Verse 20]
The gun went boom and the shot rang clear
First bullet grazed his ear
Second ball went right straight in
And he bent in the middle like a twisted pin
[Verse 21]
He crawled to the corner and he lowered his head
He gripped the chair and he grabbed the bed
It would take more than needle and thread
Bleeding from the mouth, he’s as good as dead
[Verse 22]
“You shot my husband down, you fiend” (The Wife)
“Husband? What husband? What the hell do you mean?
He was a man of strife, a man of sin
I cut him down and threw him to the wind” (Henry Lee)
[Verse 23]
This she said with angry breath
“You too shall meet the lord of death
It was I who brought your soul to life” (The Wife)
Then she raised her robe and she drew out a knife
[Verse 24]
His face was hard and caked with sweat
His arms ached and his hands were wet
“You’re a murderous queen and a bloody wife
If you don’t mind, I’ll have the knife” (Henry Lee)
[Verse 25]
“We’re two of a kind and our blood runs hot
But we’re no way similar in body or thought
All husbands are good men, as all wives know” (The Wife)
Then she pierced him to the heart and his blood did flow
[Verse 26]
His knees went limp and he reached for the door
His tomb was sealed, he slid to the floor
He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault
My fighting days have come to a halt” (Henry Lee)
[Verse 27]
She touched his lips and kissed his cheek
He tried to speak but his breath was weak
“You died for me, now I’ll die for you” (The Wife)
She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through
[Verse 28]
All three lovers together in a heap
Thrown into the grave, forever to sleep
Funeral torches blazed away
Through the towns and the villages all night and all day

[Verse 1]
Well, it’s always been my nature to take chances
My right hand drawing back while my left hand advances
Where the current is strong and the monkey dances
To the tune of a concertina
[Verse 2]
Blood dryin’ in my yellow hair as I go from shore to shore
I know what it is that has drawn me to your door
But whatever it could be, makes me think you’ve seen me before
Angelina
[Chorus]
Oh, Angelina. Oh, Angelina
[Verse 3]
His eyes were two slits that would make a snake proud
With a face that any painter would paint as he walked through the crowd
Worshipping a god with the body of a woman well endowed
And the head of a hyena
[Verse 4]
Do I need your permission to turn the other cheek?
If you can read my mind, why must I speak?
No, I have heard nothing about the man that you seek
Angelina
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
In the valley of the giants where the stars and stripes explode
The peaches they were sweet and the milk and honey flowed
I was only following instructions when the judge sent me down the road
With your subpoena
[Verse 6]
When you cease to exist, then who will you blame
I’ve tried my best to love you but I cannot play this game
Your best friend and my worst enemy is one and the same
Angelina
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
There’s a black Mercedes rolling through the combat zone
Your servants are half dead, you’re down to the bone
Tell me, tall men, where would you like to be overthrown
Maybe down in Jerusalem or Argentina?
[Verse 8]
She was stolen from her mother when she was three days old
Now her vengeance has been satisfied and her possessions have been sold
He’s surrounded by God’s angels and she’s wearing’ a blindfold
And so are you, Angelina
[Chorus]
[Verse 9]
I see pieces of men marching; trying to take heaven by force
I can see the unknown rider, I can see the pale white horse
In God’s truth tell me what you want and you’ll have it of course
Just step into the arena
[Verse 10]
Beat a path of retreat up them spiral staircases
Pass the tree of smoke, pass the angel with four faces
Begging God for mercy and weeping’ in unholy places
Angelina
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Old man sailing in a dinghy boat
Down there
Old man down is baiting a hook
On there
Gonna pull man down on a suckling hook
Gonna pull man into the suckling brook
Oh yeah!
[Verse 2]
Now, he’s underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah!
That’s underneath that tree
There’s gonna be just you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah!
[Verse 3]
I push him back and I stand in line
Oh yeah!
Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line
Oh yeah!
Then I hush my Sadie and stand in line
I get on board in two-eyed time
Oh yeah!
[Verse 4]
Under that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah!
Under that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah!
Underneath that tree
There’s just gonna be you and me
Underneath that apple suckling tree
Oh yeah!
[Verse 5]
Now, who’s on the table, who’s to tell me?
Oh yeah!
Who’s on the table, who’s to tell me?
Oh yeah!
Who should I tell, oh, who should I tell?
The forty-nine of you like bats out of hell
Oh underneath that old apple suckling tree

[Verse 1]
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning
Now, for recreation, we went on a tramp
And we met Sergeant Napper and Corporal Vamp
And a little wee drummer intending to camp
For the day being pleasant and charming
[Verse 2]
"Good morning, good morning," the Sergeant he cried
"And the same to you, gentlemen," we did reply
Intending no harm but meant to pass by
For it being on Christmas morning
"But," says he, "My fine fellows, if you will enlist
Ten guineas in gold I'll stick to your fist
And a crown in the bargain for to kick up the dust
And drink the king's health in the morning
[Verse 3]
"For a soldier, he leads a very fine life
And he always is blessed with a charming young wife
And he pays all his debts without sorrow or strife
And he always lives pleasant and charming
And a soldier, he always is decent and clean
In the finest of clothing he's constantly seen
While other poor fellows go dirty and mean
And sup on thin gruel in the morning."
[Verse 4]
"But," says Arthur, "I wouldn't be proud of your clothes
For you've only the lend of them, as I suppose
But you dare not change them one night, for you know
If you do, you'll be flogged in the morning
And although that we're single and free
We take great delight in our own company
We have no desire strange places to see
Although that your offers are charming
[Verse 5]
"And we have no desire to take your advance
All hazards and dangers we barter on chance
For you'd have no scruples for to send us to France
Where we would get shot without warning,"
"Oh no," says the Sergeant. "I'll have no such chat
And neither will I take it from snappy young brats
For if you insult me with one other word
I'll cut off your heads in the morning."
[Verse 6]
And Arthur and I, we soon drew our hogs
And we scarce gave them time to draw their own blades
When a trusty shillelagh came over their head
And bid them take that as fair warning
And their old rusty rapiers that hung by their sides
We flung them as far as we could in the tide
"Now take them up, devils!" cried Arthur McBride
"And temper their edge in the morning!"
[Verse 7]
And the little wee drummer, we flattened his bow
And we made a football of his rowdy-dow-dow
Threw it in the tide for to rock and to roll
And bade it a tedious returning
And we having no money, paid them off in cracks
We paid no respect to their two bloody backs
And we lathered them there like a pair of wet sacks
And left them for dead in the morning
[Verse 8]
And so, to conclude and to finish disputes
We obligingly asked if they wanted recruits
For we were the lads who would give them hard clouts
And bid them look sharp in the morning'
[Verse 9]
Oh, me and my cousin, one Arthur McBride
As we went a-walking down by the seaside
Mark now what followed and what did betide
For it being on Christmas morning

[Verse 1]
How many times have you heard someone say
If I had his money I'd do things my way
Hmm, but little they know
Hmm, it's so hard to find
One rich man in ten with a satisfied mind
[Verse 2]
Hmm, once I was wadding in fortune and fame
Everything that I dreamed of to get a start in life’s game
But suddenly it happened
Hmm, I lost every dime
But I'm richer by far with a satisfied mind
[Verse 3]
Hmm, when my life is over and my time has run out
My friends and my love ones
I'll leave there ain't no doubt
But one thing for certain
When it comes my time
I'll leave this old world with a satisfied mind

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to leave my lonesome home
And sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to hear my milk cow moan
And sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to hit that highway road
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, Lord, I had my overflowing fill
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to make out my final will
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to head for the walking hill
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to lay right down and die
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to climb up to the sky
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to laugh until I cry
But then again, I said again, I said again, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
[Verse 4]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to sleep in my pony’s stall
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I ain’t going to do nothing at all
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to fly like a cannonball
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
[Verse 5]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to back up against the wall
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to run till I have to crawl
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I ain’t going to do nothing at all
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you
[Verse 6]
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I want to change my house around
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to make a change in this here town
Sometimes I’m in the mood, I’m going to change the world around
But then again, but then again, I said oh, I said oh, I said
Oh babe, I’m in the mood for you

[Verse 1]
You been down to the bottom with a bad man, babe
But you’re back where you belong
Go get me my pistol, babe
Honey, I can’t tell right from wrong
[Chorus]
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying, stop crying, stop crying
Baby, please stop crying
You know, I know, the sun will always shine
So baby, please stop crying ’cause it’s tearing up my mind
[Verse 2]
Go down to the river, babe
Honey, I will meet you there
Go down to the river, babe
Honey, I will pay your fare
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
If you’re looking for assistance, babe
Or if you just want some company
Or if you just want a friend you can talk to
Honey, come and see about me
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
You been hurt so many times
And I know what you’re thinking of
Well, I don’t have to be no doctor, babe
To see that you’re madly in love
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Sad I’m a-sittin’ on the railroad track
Watching’ that old smokestack
Train is a-leavin’ but it won’t be back
[Verse 2]
Years ago we hung around
Watching’ trains roll through the town
Now that train is a-graveyard bound
[Verse 3]
Where we go up in that North Country
Lakes and streams and mines so free
I had no better friend than he
[Verse 4]
Something happened to him that day
I thought I heard a stranger say
I hung my head and stole away
[Verse 5]
A diesel truck was rolling’ slowly
Pulling’ down a heavy load
It left him on a Utah road
[Verse 6]
They carried him back to his home town
His mother cried, his sister moaned
Listening’ to them church bells tone

[Verse 1]
One evening for pleasure I rambled to view
The fair fields all alone
Down by the banks of Loch Eiron
Where beauty and pleasure were known
[Verse 2]
I spied a fair maid at her labour
Which caused me to stay for a while
And I thought of a goddess to beauty
Bloomin' bright star of Bright Isle
[Verse 3]
I humbled myself to her beauty
"Fair maiden, where do you belong?
Are you from heaven descended
Abiding in Cupid's fair throne?"
[Verse 4]
"Young man, I will tell you a secret
It's true I'm a maid that is poor
And to part from my vows and my promise
Is more than my heart can endure
[Verse 5]
Therefore I remain at my service
And go through all my hardship and toil
And wait for the lad that has left me
All alone on the banks of Belle Isle."
[Verse 6]
"Young maiden I wish not to banter
It's true I come here in disguise
I came here to fulfill our last promise
And hope to give you a surprise
[Verse 7]
I've known you're a maid I love dearly
And you've been in my heart all the while
For me there is no other damsel
Than my blooming bright star of Belle Isle."

[Verse 1]
I love you pretty baby
You're the only love I've ever known
Just as long as you stay with me
The whole world is my throne
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing we can call our own
[Verse 2]
I'm moving after midnight
Down boulevards of broken cars
Don't know what to do without it
Without this love that we call ours
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing but the moon and stars
[Verse 3]
Down every street there's a window
And every window made of glass
We'll keep on loving pretty baby
For as long as love will last
Beyond here lies nothing
But the mountains of the past
[Verse 4]
My ship is in the harbor
And the sails are spread
Listen to me pretty baby
Lay your hand upon my head
Beyond here lies nothing
Nothing done and nothing said

[Intro]
Beyond the horizon, behind the sun
At the end of the rainbow life has only begun
In the long hours of twilight 'neath the stardust above
Beyond the horizon it is easy to love
[Verse 1]
My wretched heart's pounding
I felt an angel's kiss
My memories are drowning
In mortal bliss
Beyond the horizon, in the Springtime or Fall
Love waits forever for one and for all
[Verse 2]
Beyond the horizon across the divide
'Round about midnight, we'll be on the same side
Down in the valley the water runs cold
Beyond the horizon someone prayed for your soul
[Verse 3]
I'm touched with desire
What don't I do?
I'll throw the logs on the fire
I'll build my world around you
Beyond the horizon, at the end of the game
Every step that you take, I'm walking the same
[Verse 4]
Beyond the horizon the night winds blow
The theme of a melody from many moons ago
The bells of St. Mary, how sweetly they chime
Beyond the horizon I found you just in time
[Verse 5]
It's dark and it's dreary
I ponder in vain
I'm weakened, I'm weary
My repentance is plain
Beyond the horizon o'er the treacherous sea
I still can't believe that you've set aside your love for me
[Verse 6]
Beyond the horizon, 'neath crimson skies
In the soft light of morning I'll follow you with my eyes
Through countries and kingdoms and temples of stone
Beyond the horizon right down to the bone
[Verse 7]
It's late in the season
Never knew, never cared
Whatever the reason
Someone's life has been spared
[Outro]
Beyond the horizon the sky is so blue
I've got more than a lifetime to live lovin' you

[Verse 1]
There’s guns across the river aimin’ at ya
Lawman on your trail, he’d like to catch ya
Bounty hunters, too, they’d like to get ya
Billy, they don’t like you to be so free
[Verse 2]
Campaign’ out all night on the veranda
Dealing’ cards ’till dawn in the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill they’d like to send ya
Billy, don’t you turn your back on me
[Verse 3]
Playing’ around with some sweet señorita
Into her dark hallway she will lead ya
In some lonesome shadows she will greet ya
Billy, you’re so far away from home
[Verse 4]
There’s eyes behind the mirrors in empty places
Bullet holes and scars between the spaces
There’s always one more notch and ten more paces
Billy, and you’re walking’ all alone
[Verse 5]
They say that Pat Garrett’s got your number
So sleep with one eye open when you slumber
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun
[Verse 5]
Guitars will play your grand finale
Down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
Billy, you’re so far away from home
[Verse 6]
There’s always some new stranger sneakin’ glances
Some trigger-happy fool willin’ to take chances
And some old whore from San Pedro to make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul
[Verse 7]
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
They’ve hired Pat Garrett to force a showdown
Billy, don’t it make ya feel so low-down
To be shot down by the man who was your friend?
[Verse 8]
Hang on to your woman if you got one
Remember in El Paso, once, you shot one
She may have been a whore, but she was a hot one
Billy, you have been running’ for so long
[Verse 9]
Guitars will play your grand finale
Down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in the Rio Pecos valley
Billy, you’re so far away from home

[Verse 1]
There's guns across the river about to pound you
There's a lawman on your trail like to surround you
Bounty hunters are dancing all around you
Billy, they don't like you to be so free
[Verse 2]
Camping out all night on the veranda
Walking in the streets down by the hacienda
Up to Boot Hill the like to send you
Billy, don't you turn your back on me
[Verse 3]
There's mills inside the minds of crazy faces
Bullet holes and rifles in their cases
There is always one more notch in four more aces
Billy, and you're playing all alone
[Verse 4]
Playing around with some sweet signorita
Into her dark chamber she will greet you
In the shadows of the maizes she will lead you
Billy, and you're going all alone
[Verse 5]
They say that Pat Garrett's got your number
So sleep with one eye open, when you wander
Every little sound just might be thunder
Thunder from the barrel of his gun
[Verse 6]
There's always another stranger sneaking glances
Some trigger-happy fool willing to take chances
Some old whore from San Pedro'll make advances
Advances on your spirit and your soul
[Verse 7]
The businessmen from Taos want you to go down
So they've hired mister Garrett, he'll force you to slow down
Billy, don't let it make you feel so low down
To be hunted by the man who was your friend
[Verse 8]
So hang on to your woman, if you got one
Remember in El Paso once you shot one
I'll be in Santa Fe about one
Billy, you've been running for so long
[Verse 9]
Gypsy queens will play your grand finale
Way down in some Tularosa alley
Maybe in La Rio Pecas valley
Billy, you're so far away from home
Billy, you're so far away from home

Instrumental

[Verse 1]
I woke in the morning’, wandring
Wasted and worn out
I woke in the morning’, wandring
Wasted and worn out
Wishing’ my long-lost lover
Will walk to me, talk to me
Tell me what it’s all about
[Verse 2]
I was standing’ at the side road
Listening’ to the billboard knock
Standing at the side road
Listening’ to the billboard knock
Well, my wrist was empty
But my nerves were kicking’
Ticking’ like a clock
[Verse 3]
If I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
If I got anything you need, babe
Let me tell you in front
You can come to me sometime
Night time, day time
Any time you want
[Verse 4]
Sometimes I’m thinking I’m
Too high to fall
Sometimes I’m thinking I’m
Too high to fall
Other times I’m thinking I’m
So low I don’t know
If I can come up at all
[Verse 5]
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Black crows in the meadow
Across a broad highway
Though it’s funny, honey
I just don’t feel much like a
Scarecrow today

[Verse 1]
Up on the white veranda
She wears a necktie and a Panama hat
Her passport shows a face
From another time and place
She looks nothing like that
And all the remnants of her recent past
Are scattered in the wild wind
She walks across the marble floor
Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in
She smiles, walks the other way
As the last ship sails and the moon fades away
From Black Diamond Bay
[Verse 2]
As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down
And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write
“Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says
Carefully removes his fez
“Am I hearing you right?”
And as the yellow fog is lifting
The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor
She passes him on the spiral staircase
Thinking he’s the Soviet Ambassador
She starts to speak, but he walks away
As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway
On Black Diamond Bay
[Verse 3]
A soldier sits beneath the fan
Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring
Lightning strikes, the lights blow out
The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout
“Can you see anything?”
Then the Greek appears on the second floor
In his bare feet with a rope around his neck
While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle
Says, “Open up another deck”
But the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”
As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away
From Black Diamond Bay
[Verse 4]
The desk clerk heard the woman laugh
As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough
He tried to grab the woman’s hand
Said, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”
She said, “That is not enough”
Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags
While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb
She passed the door that the Greek had locked
Where a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”
She knocked upon it anyway
As the sun went down and the music did play
On Black Diamond Bay
[Verse 5]
“I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”
But the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor
He hung there from the chandelier
She cried, “Help, there’s danger near
Please open up the door!”
Then the volcano erupted
And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above
The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner
Thinking of forbidden love
But the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”
As the stars fell down and the fields burned away
On Black Diamond Bay
[Verse 6]
As the island slowly sank
The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room
The dealer said, “It’s too late now
You can take your money, but I don’t know how
You’ll spend it in the tomb”
The tiny man bit the soldier’s ear
As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew
While she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her
“My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”
She sheds a tear and then begins to pray
As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away
From Black Diamond Bay
[Verse 7]
I was sitting home alone one night in L.A
Watching old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news
It seems there was an earthquake that
Left nothing but a Panama hat
And a pair of old Greek shoes
Didn’t seem like much was happening
So I turned it off and went to grab another beer
Seems like every time you turn around
There’s another hard-luck story that you’re going to hear
And there’s really nothing anyone can say
And I never did plan to go anyway
To Black Diamond Bay

[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning, feeling blue
Seen a good-looking girl, can I make love with you?
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do
[Verse 2]
I went back home, put on my tie
Going to get that girl that money that money will buy
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do
[Verse 3]
She looked at me, begin to smile
Said, "Hey, hey, man, can't you wait a little while?"
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
No, no, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do
[Verse 4]
No, no, mama, I can't wait
You got my money, now you're trying to break this date
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do
[Verse 5]
I tell you something, tell you the facts
You don't want me, give my money back
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
Hey, hey, babe, I got blood in my eyes for you
I got blood in my eyes for you, babe
I don't care what in the world you do

[Verse 1]
How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
Yes, and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannon balls fly
Before they're forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
[Verse 2]
How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky?
Yes, and how many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry?
Yes, and how many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind
[Verse 3]
How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the sea?
Yes, and how many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free?
Yes, and how many times can a man turn his head
Pretending he just doesn't see?
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind
The answer is blowing in the wind

[Intro]
Blue moon, you saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
[Bridge]
Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayet for someone I really could care for
[Verse 1]
And suddenly there appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold
I heard someone whisper, "Please, adore me"
And when I looked my moon had turned to gold
[Verse 2]
Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own
Without a love of my own

[Verse 1]
Well, the Lone Ranger and Tonto
They are riding down the line
Fixing everybody’s troubles
Everybody’s except mine
Somebody must have told them
That I was doing fine
[Verse 2]
Oh you five and ten cent women
With nothing in your heads
I got a real gal I’m loving
And Lord I’ll love her till I’m dead
Go away from my door and my window too
Right now
[Verse 3]
Lord, I am not going down to no race track
See no sports car run
I don’t have no sports car
And I don’t even care to have one
I can walk anytime around the block
[Verse 4]
Well, the wind keeps a-blowing me
Up and down the street
With my hat in my hand
And my boots on my feet
Watch out so you don’t step on me
[Verse 5]
Well, look it here buddy
You want to be like me
Pull out your six-shooter
And rob every bank you can see
Tell the judge I said it was all right
Yes!

[Verse 1]
Buckets of rain
Buckets of tears
Got all them buckets comin’ out of my ears
Buckets of moonbeams in my hand
You got all the love, honey baby
I can stand
[Verse 2]
I been meek
And hard like an oak
I seen pretty people disappear like smoke
Friends will arrive, friends will disappear
If you want me, honey baby
I’ll be here
[Verse 3]
Like your smile
And your fingertips
Like the way that you move your hips
I like the cool way you look at me
Everything about you is bringing me
Misery
[Verse 4]
Little red wagon
Little red bike
I ain’t no monkey but I know what I like
I like the way you love me strong and slow
I’m talking’ you with me, honey baby
When I go
[Verse 5]
Life is sad
Life is a bust
All ya can do is do what you must
You do what you must do and ya do it well
I’ll do it for you, honey baby
Can’t you tell?

Instrumental

[Verse 1]
Well, I walked all night long
Listening’ to them church bells tone
Yes, I walked all night long
Listening’ to them church bells tone
Either someone needing mercy
Or maybe something I’ve done wrong
[Verse 2]
Well, your friends come by for you
I don’t know what to say
Well, your friends come by for you
I don’t know what to say
I just can’t face up to tell them
Honey you just went away
[Verse 3]
Well, children cry for mother
I tell them, “Mother took a trip”
Well, children cry for mother
I tell them, “Mother took a trip”
Well, I walk on pins and needles
I hope my tongue don’t slip
[Verse 4]
Well, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
Yes, I gaze at passing strangers
In case I might see you
But the sun goes around the heavens
And another day just drives on through

[Verse 1]
Well, it's all of fair and handsome girl
She's all in her tender years
She fell in love with a sailor boy
It's true she loved him well
For to go off to sea with him
Like she did not know how
She longed to see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o
[Verse 2]
So she bargained with the sailor boy
All for a piece of gold
Straightaway then he led her
Down into the hold
Sayin', "I'll dress you up in sailor's clothes
Your jacket shall be blue
You'll see that seaport town
Of Canadee-i-o
[Verse 3]
Now, when the other sailors heard the news
Well, they fell into a rage
And with all the ship's company
They were willing to engage
Saying, "We'll tie her hands and feet, my boys
Overboard we'll throw her
She'll never see that seaport town
Called Canadee-i-o
[Verse 4]
Now, when the captain he heard the news
Well, he too fell in a rage
And with the whole ship's company
He was willing to engage
Sayin', "She'll stay in sailor's clothes
Her color shall be blue
She'll see that seaport town
Call Canadee-i-o
[Verse 5]
Now, when they come down to Canada
Scarcely 'bout half a year
She's married this bold captain
Who called her his dear
She's dressed in silks and satins now
She cuts a gallant show
Finest of the ladies
Down Canadee-i-o
[Verse 6]
Come, all you fair and tender girls
Wheresoever you may be
I'd have you to follow your own true love
Whene'er he goes to sea
For if the sailors prove false to you
Well, the captain, he might prove true
You'll see the honor I have gained
By the wearing of the blue

[Verse 1]
Wise men say, only fools rush in
But I can't help falling in love with you
Shall I stay, will it be a sin
If I can't help falling in love with you ?
[Verse 2]
Like a river flows surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes, some things were meant to be
Take my hand, take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you

Instrumental

[Verse 1]
I can’t wait, wait for you to change your mind
It’s late, I’m trying to walk the line
Well, it’s way past midnight and there are people all around
Some on their way up, some on their way down
The air burns and I’m trying to think straight
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait
[Verse 2]
I’m your man, I’m trying to recover the sweet love that we knew
You understand that my heart can’t go on beating without you
Well, your loveliness has wounded me, I’m reeling from the blow
I wish I knew what it was keeps me loving you so
I’m breathing hard, standing at the gate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait
[Verse 3]
Skies are grey, I’m looking for anything that will bring a happy glow
Night or day, it doesn’t matter where I go anymore, I just go
If I ever saw you coming I don’t know what I would do
I’d like to think I could control myself, but it isn’t true
That’s how it is when things disintegrate
And I don’t know how much longer I can wait
[Bridge]
I’m doomed to love you, I’ve been rolling through stormy weather
I’m thinking of you and all the places we could roam together
[Verse 4]
It’s mighty funny, the end of time has just begun
Oh, honey, after all these years you’re still the one
While I’m strolling through the lonely graveyard of my mind
I left my life with you somewhere back there along the line
I thought somehow that I would be spared this fate
But I don’t know how much longer I can wait

[Verse 1]
He sits in your room, his tomb, with a fist full of tacks
Preoccupied with his vengeance
Cursing the dead that can’t answer him back
I’m sure that he has no intentions
Of looking your way, unless it’s to say
That he needs you to test his inventions
[Chorus]
Can you please crawl out your window?
Use your arms and legs it won’t ruin you
How can you say he will haunt you?
You can go back to him any time you want to
[Verse 2]
He looks so truthful, is this how he feels
Trying to peel the moon and expose it
With his businesslike anger and his bloodhounds that kneel
If he needs a third eye he just grows it
He just needs you to talk or to hand him his chalk
Or pick it up after he throws it
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Why does he look so righteous while your face is so changed
Are you frightened of the box you keep him in
While his genocide fools and his friends rearrange
Their religion of the little tin women
That backs up their views but your face is so bruised
Come on out the dark is beginning
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
She was the rose of Sharon from paradise lost
From the city of seven hills near the place of the cross
I was playing a show in Miami in the theater of divine comedy
Told about Jesus, told about the rain
She told me about the jungle where her brothers were slain
By a man who danced on the roof of the embassy
[Verse 2]
Was she a child or a woman, I can’t say which
From one to another she could easily switch
We went into the wall to where the long arm of the law could not reach
Could I been used and played as a pawn?
It certainly was possible as the gay night wore on
Where men bathed in perfume and celebrated free speech
[Verse 3]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire
[Verse 4]
She looked into my soul through the clothes that I wore
She said, “We got a mutual friend over by the door
And you know he’s got our best interest in mind”
He was well connected but her heart was a snare
And she had left him to die in there
There were payments due and he was a little behind
[Verse 5]
The cry of the peacock, flies buzz my head
Ceiling fan broken, there’s a heat in my bed
Street band playing “Nearer My God to Thee”
We met at the steeple where the mission bells ring
She said, “I know what you’re thinking, but there ain’t a thing
You can do about it, so let us just agree to agree”
[Verse 6]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire
[Verse 7]
Atlantic City by the cold grey sea
I hear a voice crying, “Daddy,” I always think it’s for me
But it’s only the silence in the buttermilk hills that call
Every new messenger brings evil report
’Bout armies on the march and time that is short
And famines and earthquakes and hatred written upon walls
[Verse 8]
Would I have married her? I don’t know, I suppose
She had bells in her braids and they hung to her toes
But I kept hearing my name and had to be moving on
I saw screws break loose, saw the devil pound tin
I saw a house in the country being torn from within
I heard my ancestors calling from the land far beyond
[Verse 9]
And them Caribbean winds still blow from Nassau to Mexico
Fanning the flames in the furnace of desire
And them distant ships of liberty on them iron waves so bold and free
Bringing everything that’s near to me nearer to the fire

[Intro]
The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
The cat’s in the well, the wolf is looking down
He got his big bushy tail dragging all over the ground
[Verse 1]
The cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
Cat’s in the well, the gentle lady is asleep
She ain’t hearing a thing, the silence is a-stickin’ her deep
The cat’s in the well and grief is showing its face
The world’s being slaughtered and it’s such a bloody disgrace
[Verse 2]
The cat’s in the well, the horse is going bumpety bump
The cat’s in the well, and the horse is going bumpety bump
Back alley Sally is doing the American jump
The cat’s in the well, and Papa is reading the news
His hair’s falling out and all of his daughters need shoes
[Verse 3]
The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
The cat’s in the well and the barn is full of bull
The night is so long and the table is oh, so full
The cat’s in the well and the servant is at the door
The drinks are ready and the dogs are going to war
[Outro]
The cat’s in the well, the leaves are starting to fall
The cat’s in the well, leaves are starting to fall
Goodnight, my love, may the Lord have mercy on us all

[Verse 1]
Let's get away from sleigh bells
Let's get away from snow
Let's make a break some Christmas, dear
I know the place to go
[Verse 2]
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to spend the holiday away across the sea?
How'd you like to spend Christmas on Christmas Island?
How'd you like to hang a stocking on a great big coconut tree?
[Verse 3]
How'd you like to stay up late, like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray for everyday your Christmas dreams come true
[Verse 4]
How'd you like to stay up late like the islanders do?
Wait for Santa to sail in with your presents in a canoe
If you ever spend Christmas on Christmas Island
You will never stray, for everyday your Christmas dreams come true
On Christmas Island your dreams come true

[Verse 1]
Everybody wants to know why he couldn’t adjust
Adjust to what, a dream that bust?
[Chorus]
He was a clean-cut kid
But they made a killer out of him
That’s what they did
[Verse 2]
They said what’s up is down, they said what isn’t is
They put ideas in his head he thought were his
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
He was on the baseball team, he was in the marching band
When he was ten years old he had a watermelon stand
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
He went to church on Sunday, he was a Boy Scout
For his friends he would turn his pockets inside out
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
They said, “Listen boy, you’re just a pup”
They sent him to a napalm health spa to shape up
They gave him dope to smoke, drinks and pills
A jeep to drive, blood to spill
They said “Congratulations, you got what it takes”
They sent him back into the rat race without any brakes
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
He bought the American dream but it put him in debt
The only game he could play was Russian roulette
He drank Coca-Cola, he was eating Wonder Bread
Ate Burger Kings, he was well fed
He went to Hollywood to see Peter O’Toole
He stole a Rolls-Royce and drove it in a swimming pool
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
He could’ve sold insurance, owned a restaurant or bar
Could’ve been an accountant or a tennis star
He was wearing boxing gloves, took a dive one day
Off the Golden Gate Bridge into China Bay
His mama walks the floor, his daddy weeps and moans
They got to sleep together in a home they don’t own
[Chorus]
[Verse 8]
Well, everybody’s asking why he couldn’t adjust
All he ever wanted was somebody to trust
They took his head and turned it inside out
He never did know what it was all about
He had a steady job, he joined the choir
He never did plan to walk the high wire
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
After a while we took in the clothes
Nobody said very much
Just some old wild shirts and a couple pairs of pants
Which nobody really wanted to touch
Mama come in and picked up a book
And Papa asked her what it was
Someone else asked, “What do you care?”
Papa said, “Well, just because”
Then they started to take back their clothes
Hang them on the line
It was January the thirtieth
And everybody was feelin’ fine
[Verse 2]
The next day everybody got up
Seeing’ if the clothes were dry
The dogs were barking, a neighbor passed
Mama, of course, she said, “Hi!”
“Have you heard the news?” he said, with a grin
“The Vice-President’s gone mad!”
“Where?” “Downtown.” “When?” “Last night”
“Hmm, say, that’s too bad!”
“Well, there’s nothing’ we can do about it,” said the neighbor
“It’s just something we’re gonna have to forget”
“Yes, I guess so,” said Ma
Then she asked me if the clothes was still wet
[Verse 3]
I reached up, touched my shirt
And the neighbor said, “Are those clothes yours?”
I said, “Some of them, not all of them”
He said, “Ya always help out around here with the chores?”
I said, “Sometime, not all the time”
Then my neighbor, he blew his nose
Just as Papa yelled outside
“Mama wants you to’ come back in the house and bring them clothes”
Well, I just do what I’m told
So, I did it, of course
I went back in the house and Mama met me
And then I shut all the doors

[Verse 1]
Get you a copper kettle, get you a copper coil
Fill it with new made corn mash and never more you'll toil
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight
[Verse 2]
Build you a fire with hickory, hickory, ash and oak
Don't use no green or rotten wood, they'll get you by the smoke
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight
[Verse 3]
My daddy he made whiskey, my granddaddy he did too
We ain't paid no whiskey tax since 1792
You'll just lay there by the juniper while the moon is bright
Watch them just a-filling in the pale moonlight

[Verse 1]
Crash on the levee, mama
Water's going to overflow
Swamp's going to rise
No boat's going to row
Now, you can train on down
To Williams Point
You can bust your feet
You can rock this joint
[Chorus]
But oh mama, ain't you going to miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow
[Verse 2]
Now, don't you try an' move me
You're just going to lose
There's a crash on the levee
And, mama, you've been refused
Well, it's sugar for sugar
And salt for salt
If you go down in the flood
It's going to be your own fault
[Chorus]
Oh mama, ain't you going to miss your best friend now?
You're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow
[Verse 3]
Well, that high tide's rising
Mama, don't you let me down
Pack up your suitcase
Mama, don't you make a sound
Now, it's king for king
Queen for queen
It's going to be the meanest flood
That anybody's seen
[Chorus]
Oh mama, ain't you going to miss your best friend now?
Yes, you're going to have to find yourself
Another best friend, somehow

[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?
[Verse 1]
Are you ready to meet Jesus?
Are you where you ought to be?
Will He know you when He sees you
Or will He say, “Depart from Me”?
[Chorus]
Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Am I ready, am I ready?
Am I ready, am I ready?
[Verse 2]
Am I ready to lay down my life for the brethren
And to take up my cross?
Have I surrendered to the will of God
Or am I still acting like the boss?
[Chorus]
Am I ready, hope I’m ready
[Verse 3]
When destruction cometh swiftly
And there’s no time to say a fare-thee-well
Have you decided whether you want to be
In heaven or in hell?
[Chorus]
Are you ready, are you ready?
[Verse 4]
Have you got some unfinished business?
Is there something holding you back?
Are you thinking for yourself
Or are you following the pack?
[Chorus]
Are you ready, hope you’re ready
Are you ready?
Are you ready for the judgment?
Are you ready for that terrible swift sword?
Are you ready for Armageddon?
Are you ready for the day of the Lord?
Are you ready, I hope you’re ready

[Verse 1]
Oh, the gentlemen are talking and the midnight moon is on the riverside
They’re drinking up and walking and it is time for me to slide
I live in another world where life and death are memorized
Where the earth is strung with lovers pearls and all I see are dark eyes
[Verse 2]
A cock is crowing far away and another soldier’s deep in prayer
Some mother’s child has gone astray, she can’t find him anywhere
But I can hear another drum beating for the dead that rise
Whom nature’s beast fears as they come and all I see are dark eyes
[Verse 3]
They tell me to be discreet for all intended purposes
They tell me revenge is sweet and from where they stand, I’m sure it is
But I feel nothing for their game where beauty goes unrecognized
All I feel is heat and flame and all I see are dark eyes
[Verse 4]
Oh, the French girl, she’s in paradise and a drunken man is at the wheel
Hunger pays a heavy price to the falling gods of speed and steel
Oh, time is short and the days are sweet and passion rules the arrow that flies
A million faces at my feet but all I see are dark eyes

[Verse 1]
Oh, the benches were stained with tears and perspiration
The birdies were flying from tree to tree
There was little to say, there was no conversation
As I stepped to the stage to pick up my degree
And the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me
[Verse 2]
I glanced into the chamber where the judges were talking
Darkness was everywhere, it smelled like a tomb
I was ready to leave, I was already walking
But the next time I looked there was light in the room
And the locusts sang, yeah, it give me a chill
Oh, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang their high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they were singing for me
[Verse 3]
Outside of the gates the trucks were unloading
The weather was hot, a-nearly 90 degrees
The man standing next to me, his head was exploding
Well, I was praying the pieces wouldn’t fall on me
Yeah, the locusts sang off in the distance
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
Oh, the locusts sang off in the distance
And the locusts sang and they were singing for me
[Verse 4]
I put down my robe, picked up my diploma
Took hold of my sweetheart and away we did drive
Straight for the hills, the black hills of Dakota
Sure was glad to get out of there alive
And the locusts sang, well, it give me a chill
Yeah, the locusts sang such a sweet melody
And the locusts sang with a high whining trill
Yeah, the locusts sang and they was singing for me
Singing for me, well, singing for me

[Verse 1]
I'm old Tom Moore from the bummer's shore in that good old golden days
They call me a bummer and a ginsot too, but what cares I for praise ?
I wander around from town to town just like a roving sign
And all the people say, "There goes Tom Moore, in the days of '49"
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49
[Verse 2]
My comrades they all loved me well, a jolly saucy crew
A few hard cases I will recall though they all were brave and true
Whatever the pitch they never would flinch, they never would fret or whine
Like good old bricks they stood the kicks in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49
[Verse 3]
There was New York Jake, the butcher boy, he was always getting tight
And every time that he'd get full he was spoiling for a fight
But Jake rampaged against a knife in the hands of old Bob Stein
And over Jake they held a wake in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49
[Verse 4]
There was Poker Bill, one of the boys who was always in a game
Whether he lost or whether he won, to him it was always the same
He would ante up and draw his cards and he would you go a hatful blind
In the game with death Bill lost his breath, in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49
[Verse 5]
There was Ragshag Bill from Buffalo, I never will forget
He would roar all day and he'd roar all night and I guess he's roaring yet
One day he fell in a prospect hole, in a roaring bad design
And in that hole he roared out his soul, in the days of '49
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49
[Verse 6]
Of the comrades all that I've had, there's none that's left to boast
And I'm left alone in my misery like some poor wandering ghost
And I pass by from town to town, they call me a rambling sign
"There goes Tom Moore, a bummer shore in the days of '49 "
In the days of old, in the days of gold
How oft'times I repine for the days of old
When we dug up the gold, in the days of '49

[Verse 1]
Uttering idle words from a reprobate mind
Clinging to strange promises, dying on the vine
Never being able to separate the good from the bad
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
It’s making me feel so sad
[Chorus]
Dead man, dead man
When will you arise?
Cobwebs in your mind
Dust upon your eyes
[Verse 2]
Satan got you by the heel, there’s a bird’s nest in your hair
Do you have any faith at all? Do you have any love to share?
The way that you hold your head, cursing God with every move
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
What are you trying to prove?
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
The glamour and the bright lights and the politics of sin
The ghetto that you build for me is the one you end up in
The race of the engine that overrules your heart
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
Pretending that you’re so smart
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
What are you trying to overpower me with, the doctrine or the gun?
My back is already to the wall, where can I run?
The tuxedo that you’re wearing, the flower in your lapel
Ooh, I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it
You want to take me down to hell
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Dear landlord
Please don’t put a price on my soul
My burden is heavy
My dreams are beyond control
When that steamboat whistle blows
I’m gonna give you all I got to give
And I do hope you receive it well
Depending on the way you feel that you live
[Verse 2]
Dear landlord
Please heed these words that I speak
I know you’ve suffered much
But in this you are not so unique
All of us, at times, we might work too hard
To have it too fast and too much
And anyone can fill his life up
With things he can see but he just cannot touch
[Verse 3]
Dear landlord
Please don’t dismiss my case
I’m not about to argue
I’m not about to move to no other place
Now, each of us has his own special gift
And you know this was meant to be true
And if you don’t underestimate me
I won’t underestimate you

[Verse 1]
When you’re sad and when you’re lonely
And you haven’t got a friend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all that you’ve held sacred
Falls down and does not mend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
[Verse 2]
When you’re standing at the crossroads
That you cannot comprehend
Just remember that death is not the end
And all your dreams have vanished
And you don’t know what’s up the bend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
[Verse 3]
When the storm clouds gather ’round you
And heavy rains descend
Just remember that death is not the end
And there’s no one there to comfort you
With a helping hand to lend
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end
[Bridge]
Oh, the tree of life is growing
Where the spirit never dies
And the bright light of salvation shines
In dark and empty skies
[Verse 4]
When the cities are on fire
With the burning flesh of men
Just remember that death is not the end
And you search in vain to find
Just one law-abiding citizen
Just remember that death is not the end
Not the end, not the end
Just remember that death is not the end

[Verse 1]
Delia was a gambling girl, gambled all around
Delia was a gambling girl, she laid her money down
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 2]
Delia's dear ol' mother took a trip out West
When she returned, little Delia gone to rest
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 3]
Delia's daddy weeped, Delia's momma moaned
Wouldn't have been so bad if the poor girl died at home
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 4]
Curtis' looking high, Curtis' looking low
He shot poor Delia down with a cruel forty-four
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 5]
High up on the housetops, high as I can see
Looking for them rounders, looking out for me
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 6]
Men in Atlanta, tryin' to pass for white
Delia's in the graveyard, boys, six feet out of sight
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 7]
Judge says to Curtis, "What's this noise about?"
"All about them rounders, Judge, tryin' to cut me out."
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 8]
Curtis said to the judge, "What might be my fine?"
Judge says, "Poor boy, you got ninety-nine."
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 9]
Curtis' in the jail house, drinking from an old tin cup
Delia's in the graveyard, she ain't gettin' up
All the friends I ever had are gone
[Verse 10]
Delia, oh Delia, how can it be?
You loved all them rounders, never did love me
All the friends I ever had are gone

[Verse 1]
Now There's a man you'll hear about
Most anywhere you go
And his holdings are in Texas
And his name is Diamond Joe
[Verse 2]
And he carries all his money
In a diamond-studded jar
He never took much trouble
With the process of the law
[Verse 3]
I hired out to Diamond Joe, boys
Did offer him my hand
He gave a string of horses
So old they could not stand
[Verse 4]
And I nearly starved to death, boys
He did mistreat me so
And I never saved a dollar
In the pay of Diamond Joe
[Verse 5]
Now his bread it was corn dodger
And his meat you couldn't chaw
Nearly drove me crazy
With the wagging of his jaw
[Verse 6]
And the telling of his story
Mean to let you know
That there never was a rounder
That could lie like Diamond Joe
Instrumental
[Verse 7]
Now, I tried three times to quit him
But he did argue so
I'm still punching cattle
In the pay of Diamond Joe
[Verse 8]
And when I'm called up yonder
And it's my time to go
Give my blankets to my buddies
Give the fleas to Diamond Joe

[Verse 1]
I hate myself for loving’ you and the weakness that it showed
You were just a painted face on a trip down Suicide Road
The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel
I hate myself for loving’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell
[Verse 2]
I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed
And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?
I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within
That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin
[Verse 3]
Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped
Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped
Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’till he’s tame
All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame
[Verse 4]
There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them
In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem
The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet
I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at least I’m out of debt
[Verse 5]
Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me
’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees
We stared into each other’s eyes ’till one of us would break
No use to apologize, what difference would it make?
[Verse 6]
So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine
The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen
Lady Luck, who shines on me, will tell you where I’m at
I hate myself for loving’ you, but I should get over that

[Verse 1]
Gone walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
Gone walk down that dirt road, ’til someone lets me ride
If I can’t find my baby, I’m gonna run away and hide
[Verse 2]
I have been pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Pacing around the room hoping maybe she’d come back
Well, I have been praying for salvation laying ’round in a one-room country shack
[Verse 3]
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
Gone walk down that dirt road until my eyes begin to bleed
’Till there’s nothing left to see, ’tell the chains have been shattered
And I’ve been freed
[Verse 4]
I been looking at my shadow, I have been watching the colors up above
Looking at my shadow watching the colors up above
Rolling through the rain and hail, looking for the sunny side of love
[Verse 5]
Gone walk on down that dirt road ’till I’m right beside the sun
Gone walk on down until I’m right beside the sun
I’m gonna have to put up a barrier to keep myself away from everyone

[Verse 1]
There’s a whole lot of people suffering tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people struggling tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right down the highway
Straight down the line
Rips into your senses
Through your body and your mind
Nothing about it that’s sweet
The disease of conceit
[Verse 2]
There’s a whole lot of hearts breaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Steps into your room
Eats your soul
Over your senses
You have no control
Ain’t nothing too discreet
About the disease of conceit
[Verse 3]
There’s a whole lot of people dying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people crying tonight
From the disease of conceit
Comes right out of nowhere
And you’re down for the count
From the outside world
The pressure will mount
Turn you into a piece of meat
The disease of conceit
[Bridge]
Conceit is a disease
That the doctors got no cure
They’ve done a lot of research on it
But what it is, they’re still not sure
[Verse 4]
There’s a whole lot of people in trouble tonight
From the disease of conceit
Whole lot of people seeing double tonight
From the disease of conceit
Give ya delusions of grandeur
And a evil eye
Give you the idea that
You’re too good to die
Then they bury you from your head to your feet
From the disease of conceit

[Verse 1]
Just a minute before you leave, girl
Just a minute before you touch the door
What is it that you’re trying to achieve, girl?
Do you think we can talk about it some more?
You know, the streets are filled with vipers
Who’ve lost all ray of hope
You know, it is not even safe no more
In the palace of the Pope
[Chorus]
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
I just don’t think that I could handle it
Don’t fall apart on me tonight
Yesterday’s just a memory
Tomorrow is never what it’s supposed to be
And I need you, yeah
[Verse 2]
Come over here from over there, girl
Sit down here. You can have my chair
I can’t see us going anywhere, girl
The only place open is a thousand miles away and I can’t take you there
I wish I’d have been a doctor
Maybe I’d have saved some life that had been lost
Maybe I’d have done some good in the world
Instead of burning every bridge I crossed
[Chours]
[Verse 3]
I am not too good at conversation, girl
So you might not know exactly how I feel
But if I could, I’d bring you to the mountaintop, girl
And build you a house made out of stainless steel
But it’s like I’m stuck inside a painting
That’s hanging in the Louvre
My throat start to tickle and my nose itches
But I know that I can’t move
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Who are these people who are walking towards you?
Do you know them or will there be a fight?
With their humorless smiles so easy to see through
Can they tell you what’s wrong from what’s right?
Do you remember St. James Street
Where you blew Jackie P.’s mind?
You were so fine, Clark Gable would have fell at your feet
And laid his life on the line
Let’s try to get beneath the surface waste, girl
No more booby traps and bombs
No more decadence and charm
No more affection that’s misplaced, girl
No more mudcake creatures lying in your arms
What about that millionaire with the drumsticks in his pants?
He looked so baffled and so bewildered
When he played and we didn’t dance
[Chorus]

[Intro]
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly
[Chorus]
I went down to the river on a Saturday morn
A-looking’ around just to see who’s born
I found a little chicken down on his knees
I went up and yelled to him, “Please, please, please!”
He said, “Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly”
[Verse]
I went down to the corner at a-half past ten
I’s lookin’ around, I wouldn’t say when
I looked down low, I looked above
And who did I see but the one I love
She said, “Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly”
[Chorus][x2]
Now, I went down to the beanery at half past twelve
A-looking’ around just to see myself
I spotted a horse and a donkey, too
I looked for a cow and I saw me a few
They said, “Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Don’t ya tell Henry
Apple’s got your fly”

[Verse 1]
Don’t want to judge nobody, don’t want to be judged
Don’t want to touch nobody, don’t want to be touched
Don’t want to hurt nobody, don’t want to be hurt
Don’t want to treat nobody like they was dirt
[Chorus]
But if you do right to me, baby
I’ll do right to you, too
You got to do unto others
Like you’d have them, like you’d have them, do unto you
[Verse 2]
Don’t want to shoot nobody, don’t want to be shot
Don’t want to buy nobody, don’t want to be bought
Don’t want to bury nobody, don’t want to be buried
Don’t want to marry nobody if they’re already married
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
Don’t want to burn nobody, don’t want to be burned
Don’t want to learn from nobody what I got to unlearn
Don’t want to cheat nobody, don’t want to be cheated
Don’t want to defeat nobody if they already been defeated
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Don’t want to wink at nobody, don’t want to be winked at
Don’t want to be used by nobody for a doormat
Don’t want to confuse nobody, don’t want to be confused
Don’t want to amuse nobody, don’t want to be amused
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Don’t want to betray nobody, don’t want to be betrayed
Don’t want to play with nobody, don’t want to be waylaid
Don’t want to miss nobody, don’t want to be missed
Don’t put my faith in nobody, not even a scientist
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin’ my way
Down along the cove
I spied my true love comin’ my way
I say, “Lord, have mercy, mama
It sure is good to see you coming today"
[Verse 2]
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
Down along the cove
I spied my little bundle of joy
She said, “Lord, have mercy, honey
I’m so glad you’re my boy!”
[Verse 3]
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Down along the cove
We walked together hand in hand
Ev’rybody watchin’ us go by
Knows we’re in love, yes, and they understand

[Verse 1]
Said the night wind to the little lamb
Do you see what I see
Way up in the sky, little lamb
Do you see what I see
A star, a star, dancing in the night
With a tail as big as a kite
With a tail as big as a kite
[Verse 2]
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy
Do you hear what I hear
A song, a song, high above the trees
With a voice as big as the sea
With a voice as big as the sea
[Verse 3]
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king
Do you know what I know
In your palace warm, mighty king
Do you know what I know
A Child, a Child shivers in the cold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
Let us bring Him silver and gold
[Verse 4]
Said the king to the people everywhere
Listen to what I say
Pray for peace, people everywhere!
Listen to what I say
The Child, the Child, sleeping in the night
He will bring us goodness and light
He will bring us goodness and light

[Intro]
The light in this place is really bad
Like being at the bottom of a stream
Any minute now
I’m expecting to wake up from a dream
[Verse 1]
Means so much, the softest touch
By the grave of some child, who neither wept or smiled
I pondered my faith in the rain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane
[Verse 2]
Somewhere dawn is breaking
Light is streaking across the floor
Church bells are ringing
I wonder who they’re ringing for
[Verse 3]
Travel under any star
You’ll see me wherever you are
The shadowy past is awake and so vast
I’m sleeping in the palace of pain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane
[Verse 4]
Maybe they’ll get me, maybe they won’t
But whatever it won’t be tonight
I wish your hand was in mine right now
We could go where the moon is white
[Verse 5]
For years they had me locked in a cage
Then they threw me onto the stage
Some things just last longer than you thought they would
And they never, ever explain
I’ve been dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
And it’s driving me insane
[Verse 6]
Well, I eat when I’m hungry, drink when I’m dry
Live my life on the square
Even if the flesh falls off my face
It won’t matter, long as you’re there
[Verse 7]
Feel like a ghost in love
Underneath the heavens above
Feel further away than I ever did before
Feel further than I can take
Dreaming’ of you is all I do
But it’s driving me insane
[Verse 8]
Everything in the way is so shiny today
A queer and unusual fall
Spirals of golden haze, here and there in a blaze
Like beams of light in the storm
[Verse 9]
Maybe you were here and maybe you weren’t
Maybe you touched somebody and got burnt
The silent sun has got me on the run
Burning a hole in my brain
I’m dreaming’ of you, that’s all I do
But it’s driving me insane

[Verse 1]
I didn’t know that you’d be leaving’
Or who you thought you were talking’ to
I figure maybe we’re even
Or maybe I’m one up on you
[Verse 2]
I send you all my money
Just like I did before
I tried to reach you honey
But you’re drifting too far from shore
[Chorus]
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
Drifting too far from shore
[Verse 3]
I ain’t gonna get lost in this current
I don’t like playing cat and mouse
No gentleman likes making love to a servant
Especially when he’s in his father’s house
[Verse 4]
I never could guess your weight, baby
Never needed to call you my whore
I always thought you were straight, baby
But you’re drifting too far from shore
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Well these times and these tunnels are haunted
The bottom of the barrel is too
I waited years sometimes for what I wanted
Everybody can’t be as lucky as you
[Verse 6]
Never no more do I wonder
Why you don’t never play with me anymore
At any moment you could go under
’Cause you’re drifting too far from shore
[Chorus]
[Verse 7]
You and me we had completeness
I give you all of what I could provide
We weren’t on the wrong side, sweetness
We were the wrong side
[Verse 8]
I’ve already ripped out the phones, honey
You can’t walk the streets in a war
I can finish this alone honey
You’re drifting too far from shore

[Verse 1]
In the early morning rain with a dollar in my hand
And an aching in my heart and my pockets full of sand
I'm a long way from home and I miss my loved one so
In the early morning rain with nowhere to go
[Verse 2]
Cut on runway number nine, big 707 set to go
I'm stuck here on the ground, where the cold winds blow
The liquor tasted good and the women all were fast
There she goes, my friend, she's rolling down at last
[Verse 3]
Hear the mighty engines roar, see the silver bird on high
She's away and westward bound, far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the morning rain don't fall and the sun always shines
She'll be flying over my home in about three hours time
[Verse 4]
This old airport's got me down, it's no earthly good to me
Because I'm stuck here on the ground, cold and drunks as I might be
You can't hop a jet plane like you can a freight train
So I'd best be on my way in the early morning rain

[Verse 1]
Come baby, find me, come baby, remind me of where I once begun
Come baby, show me, show me you know me, tell me you’re the one
I could be learning, you could be yearning to see behind closed doors
But I will always be emotionally yours
[Verse 2]
Come baby, rock me, come baby, lock me into the shadows of your heart
Come baby, teach me, come baby, reach me, let the music start
I could be dreaming but I keep believing you’re the one I’m living for
And I will always be emotionally yours
[Verse 3]
It’s like my whole life never happened
When I see you, it’s as if I never had a thought
I know this dream, it might be crazy
But it’s the only one I’ve got
[Verse 4]
Come baby, shake me, come baby, take me, I would be satisfied
Come baby, hold me, come baby, help me, my arms are open wide
I could be unraveling wherever I’m traveling, even to foreign shores
But I will always be emotionally yours

[Verse 1]
I sang the song slowly
As she stood in the shadows
She stepped to the light
As my silver strings spun
She called with her eyes
To the tune I’s a-playing
But the song it was long
And I’d only begun
[Verse 2]
Through a bullet of light
Her face was reflecting
The fast fading words
That rolled from my tongue
With a long-distance look
Her eyes was on fire
But the song it was long
And there was more to be sung
[Verse 3]
My eyes danced a circle
Across her clear outline
With her head tilted sideways
She called me again
As the tune drifted out
She breathed hard through the echo
But the song it was long
And it was far to the end
[Verse 4]
I glanced at my guitar
And played it pretending
That of all the eyes out there
I could see none
As her thoughts pounded hard
Like the pierce of an arrow
But the song it was long
And it had to get done
[Verse 5]
As the tune finally folded
I laid down the guitar
Then looked for the girl
Who’d stayed for so long
But her shadow was missing
For all of my searching
So I picked up my guitar
And began the next song

[Intro]
Broken lines, broken strings
Broken threads, broken springs
Broken idols, broken heads
People sleeping in broken beds
Ain’t no use jiving
Ain’t no use joking
Everything is broken
[Verse 1]
Broken bottles, broken plates
Broken switches, broken gates
Broken dishes, broken parts
Streets are filled with broken hearts
Broken words never meant to be spoken
Everything is broken
Seem like every time you stop and turn around
Something else just hit the ground
[Verse 2]
Broken cutters, broken saws
Broken buckles, broken laws
Broken bodies, broken bones
Broken voices on broken phones
Take a deep breath, feel like you’re choking
Everything is broken
Every time you leave and go off someplace
Things fall to pieces in my face
[Outro]
Broken hands on broken ploughs
Broken treaties, broken vows
Broken pipes, broken tools
People bending broken rules
Hound dog howling, bullfrog croaking
Everything is broken

[Verse 1]
Father of night, Father of day
Father, who taketh the darkness away
Father, who teacheth the bird to fly
Builder of rainbows up in the sky
Father of loneliness and pain
Father of love and Father of rain
[Verse 2]
Father of day, Father of night
Father of black, Father of white
Father, who build the mountain so high
Who shapeth the cloud up in the sky
Father of time, Father of dreams
Father, who turneth the rivers and streams
[Verse 3]
Father of grain, Father of wheat
Father of cold and Father of heat
Father of air and Father of trees
Who dwells in our hearts and our memories
Father of minutes, Father of days
Father of whom we most solemnly praise

Instrumental

[Verse 1]
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my mind, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying
Well, I look over yonder to that burying ground
Look over yonder to that burying ground
Sure seems lonesome, Lord, when the sun goes down
[Verse 2]
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Feeling funny in my eyes, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying but
I hate to leave my children crying
There's a black smoke rising, Lord
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
It's rising up above my head, up above my head
And tell Jesus make up my dying bed
[Verse 3]
I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die, fixing to die
Yes I'm walking kind of funny, Lord
I believe I'm fixing to die
Fixing to die, fixing to die
Well, I don't mind dying
But I hate to leave my children crying

Down over the window
Comes the dazzling sunlit rays
Through the back alleys—through the blinds
Another one of them endless days
Honey bees are buzzing
Leaves begin to stir
I’m in love with my second cousin
I tell myself I could be happy forever with her
I keep listening for footsteps
But I ain’t hearing any
From the boat I fish for bullheads
I catch a lot, sometimes too many
A summer breeze is blowing
A squall is settin’ in
Sometimes it’s just plain stupid
To get into any kind of wind
The old men ’round here, sometimes they get
On bad terms with the younger men
But old, young, age don’t carry weight
It doesn’t matter in the end
One of the boss’ hangers-on
Comes to call at times you least expect
Try to bully ya—strong-arm you—inspire you with fear
It has the opposite effect
There’s a new grove of trees on the outskirts of town
The old one is long gone
Timber two-foot-six across
Burns with the bark still on
They say times are hard, if you don’t believe it
You can just follow your nose
It don’t bother me—times are hard everywhere
We’ll just have to see how it goes
My old man, he’s like some feudal lord
Got more lives than a cat
Never seen him quarrel with my mother even once
Things come alive or they fall flat
You can smell the pinewood burning
You can hear the school bell ring
Gotta get up near the teacher if you can
If you wanna learn anything
Romeo, he said to Juliet, “You got a poor complexion
It doesn’t give your appearance a very youthful touch!”
Juliet said back to Romeo, “Why don’t you just shove off
If it bothers you so much”
They all got out of here any way they could
The cold rain can give you the shivers
They went down the Ohio, the Cumberland, the Tennessee
All the rest of them rebel rivers
If you ever try to interfere with me or cross my path again
You do so at the peril of your own life
I’m not quite as cool or forgiving as I sound
I’ve seen enough heartaches and strife
My grandfather was a duck trapper
He could do it with just dragnets and ropes
My grandmother could sew new dresses out of old cloth
I don’t know if they had any dreams or hopes
I had them once though, I suppose, to go along
With all the ring-dancing Christmas carols on all of the Christmas eves
I left all my dreams and hopes
Buried under tobacco leaves
It’s not always easy kicking someone out
Gotta wait a while—it can be an unpleasant task
Sometimes somebody wants you to give something up
And tears or not, it’s too much to ask

[Verse 1]
Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male
They sang “Danny Boy” at his funeral and the Lord’s Prayer
Preacher talking ’bout Christ betrayed
It’s like the earth just opened and swallowed him up
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground
You know what they say about being’ nice to the right people on the way up
Sooner or later you gonna meet them coming’ down
[Chorus]
Well, there ain’t no goin’ back
When your foot of pride come down
Ain’t no goin’ back
[Verse 2]
Hear ya got a brother named James, don’t forget faces or names
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger
And your fall-by-the sword love affair with Errol Flynn
In these times of compassion when conformity’s in fashion
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
There’s a retired businessman named Red
Cast down from heaven and he’s out of his head
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash
He’s not somebody that you play around with much
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is
She’ll do wondrous works with your fate, feed you coconut bread
Spice buns in your bed
If you don’t mind sleeping’ with your head face down in a grave
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
Well, they’ll choose a man for you to meet tonight
You’ll play the fool and learn how to walk through the doors
How to enter into the gates of paradise
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours
Yeah, from the stage they’ll be trying’ to get water out rocks
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in
Sing “Amazing Grace” all the way to the Swiss banks
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
They got some beautiful people out there, man
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue
They got mystery written all over their forehead
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young
They don’t believe in mercy
Judgement on them is something that you’ll never see
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route
Turn you into anything that they want you to be
[Chorus]
[Verse 6]
Yes, I guess I loved him too
I can still see him in my mind climbin’ that hill
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped
Struck down by the strength of the will
Ain’t nothin’ left here partner, just the dust of a plague
That has left this whole town afraid
From now on, this’ll be where you’re from
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Forgetful heart
Lost your power of recall
Every little detail
You don't remember at all
The times we knew
Who would remember better then you
[Verse 2]
Forgetful heart
We laughed and had a good time you and I
It's been so long
Now you're content to let the days go by
When you were there
You were the answer to my prayer
[Verse 3]
Forgetful heart
We loved with all the love that life can give
What can I say
Without you it's so hard to live
Can't take much more
Why can't we love like we did before
[Verse 4]
Forgetful heart
Like a walking shadow in my brain
All night long
I lay awake and listen to the sound of pain
The door has closed forevermore
If indeed there ever was a door

[Verse 1]
I was born in Dixie in a boomer shed
Just a little shanty by the railroad track
Freight train was it taught me how to cry
The holler of the driver was my lullaby
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go baby, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues
[Verse 2]
Well, my daddy was a fireman and my mama-ha
She was the only daughter of an engineer
My sweetheart was a brakeman and it ain't no joke
Seems a waste to get a good man broke
I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes
And when the whistle blows I got to go mama, don't you know
Well, it looks like I'm never going to lose the freight train blues
[Verse 3]
Well, the only thing that makes me laugh again
Is a southbound whistle on a southbound train
Every place I want to go I never can go
Because you know I got the freight train blues
Oh Lord mama, I got them in the bottom of my rambling shoes

[Intro]
God knows you ain’t pretty
God knows it’s true
God knows there ain’t anybody
Ever gonna take the place of you
[Verse 1]
God knows it’s a struggle
God knows it’s a crime
God knows there’s gonna be no more water
But fire next time
[Verse 2]
God don’t call it treason
God don’t call it wrong
It was supposed to last a season
But it’s been so strong for so long
[Verse 3]
God knows it’s fragile
God knows everything
God knows it could snap apart right now
Just like putting scissors to a string
[Verse 4]
God knows it’s terrifying
God sees it all unfold
There’s a million reasons for you to be crying
You been so bold and so cold
[Verse 5]
God knows that when you see it
God knows you’ve got to weep
God knows the secrets of your heart
He’ll tell them to you when you’re asleep
[Verse 6]
God knows there’s a river
God knows how to make it flow
God knows you ain’t gonna be taking
Nothing with you when you go
[Verse 7]
God knows there’s a purpose
God knows there’s a chance
God knows you can rise above the darkest hour
Of any circumstance
[Verse 8]
God knows there’s a heaven
God knows it’s out of sight
God knows we can get all the way from here to there
Even if we’ve got to walk a million miles by candlelight

[Verse 1]
I’ve just reached a place
Where the willow don’t bend
There’s not much more to be said
It’s the top of the end
I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone
[Verse 2]
I’m closing’ the book
On the pages and the text
And I don’t really care
What happens next
I’m just going
I’m going
I’m gone
[Verse 3]
I been hanging on threads
I have been playing’ it straight
Now, I’ve just got to cut loose
Before it gets late
So I’m going
I’m going
I’m gone
[Verse 4]
Grandma said, “Boy, go and follow your heart
And you’ll be fine at the end of the line
All that’s gold isn’t meant to shine
Don’t you and your one true love ever part”
[Verse 5]
I been walking the road
I been living on the edge
Now, I’ve just got to go
Before I get to the ledge
So I’m going
I’m just going
I’m gone

[Verse 1]
I’m going down to Rose Marie’s
She never does me wrong
She puts it to me plain as day
And gives it to me for a song
[Verse 2]
It’s a wicked life but what the hell
The stars ain’t falling down
I’m standing outside the Taj Mahal
I don’t see no one around
[Chorus]
Going’ to Acapulco–going’ on the run
Going’ down to see fat gut–going’ to have some fun
Yeah–going’ to have some fun
[Verse 3]
Now, whenever I get up
And I ain’t got what I see
I just make it down to Rose Marie’s
’Bout a quarter after three
[Verse 4]
There are worse ways of getting there
And I ain’t complainin’ none
If the clouds don’t drop and the train don’t stop
I’m bound to meet the sun
[Chorus]
[Verse 5]
Now, if someone offers me a joke
I just say no thanks
I try to tell it like it is
And keep away from pranks
[Verse 6]
Well, sometime you know when the well breaks down
I just go pump on it some
Rose Marie, she likes to go to big places
And just set there waitin’ for me to come
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Smoky autumn night, stars up in the sky
I see the sailing boats across the bay go by
Eucalyptus trees hang above the street
And then I turn my head, for you’re approaching me
Moonlight on the water, fisherman’s daughter, floating in to my room
With a golden loom
[Verse 2]
First we wash our feet near the immortal shrine
And then our shadows meet and then we drink the wine
I see the hungry clouds up above your face
And then the tears roll down, what a bitter taste
And then you drift away on a summer’s day where the wildflowers bloom
With your golden loom
[Verse 3]
I walk across the bridge in the dismal light
Where all the cars are stripped between the gates of night
I see the trembling lion with the lotus flower tail
And then I kiss your lips as I lift your veil
But you’re gone and then all I seem to recall is the smell of perfume
And your golden loom

[Verse 1]
Going to change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Going to change my way of thinking
Make myself a different set of rules
Going to put my good foot forward
And stop being influenced by fools
[Verse 2]
So much oppression
Can’t keep track of it no more
So much oppression
Can’t keep track of it no more
Sons becoming husbands to their mothers
And old men turning young daughters into whores
[Verse 3]
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Stripes on your shoulders
Stripes on your back and on your hands
Swords piercing your side
Blood and water flowing through the land
[Verse 4]
Well don’t know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
Well don’t know which one is worse
Doing your own thing or just being cool
You remember only about the brass ring
You forget all about the golden rule
[Verse 5]
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
You can mislead a man
You can take ahold of his heart with your eyes
But there’s only one authority
And that’s the authority on high
[Verse 6]
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
I got a God-fearing woman
One I can easily afford
She can do the Georgia crawl
She can walk in the spirit of the Lord
[Verse 7]
Jesus said, “Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come”
Jesus said, “Be ready
For you know not the hour in which I come”
He said, “He who is not for Me is against Me”
Just so you know where He’s coming from
[Verse 8]
There’s a kingdom called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
There’s a kingdom called Heaven
A place where there is no pain of birth
Well the Lord created it, mister
About the same time He made the earth
ALTERNATE VERSION
[Verse 9}
Change my way of thinking, make myself a different set of rules
Change my way of thinking, make myself a different set of rules
Put my best foot forward, stop being influenced by fools
[Verse 10]
I’m sitting at the welcome table, I’m so hungry I could eat a horse
I’m sitting at the welcome table, I’m so hungry I could eat a horse
I’m going to revitalize my thinking, I’m going to let the law take its course
[Verse 11]
Jesus is calling, He’s coming back to gather up his jewels
Jesus is calling, He’s coming back to gather up his jewels
We living by the golden rule, whoever got the gold rules
[Verse 12]
The sun is shining, it's not but one train on this track
The sun is shining, it's not but one train on this track
I’m stepping out of the dark woods, I’m jumping on the monkey’s back
[Verse 13]
I’m all dressed up, I’m going to the county dance
I’m all dressed up, I’m going to the county dance
Every day you got to pray for guidance
Every day you got to give yourself a chance
[Verse 14]
Storms are on the ocean, storms out on the mountain, too
Storms are on the ocean, storms out on the mountain, too
Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you
[Verse 15]
I’ll tell you something, things you never had you’ll never miss
I’ll tell you something, things you never had you’ll never miss
A brave man will kill you with a sword, a coward with a kiss

[Verse 1]
Mary wore three links of chain
Every link was Jesus name
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
[Verse 2]
Mary, Mark, Luke and John
All these prophets so good and gone
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Well, I never been to heaven
But I've been told streets up there
Are lined with gold
Keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on
Oh Lord, Oh Lord, keep your hand on that plow, hold on

Well, I had to go down and see a guy named Mr. Goldsmith
A nasty, dirty, double-crossin’, backstabbin’ phony I didn’t wanna have to be dealin’ with
But I did it for you and all you gave me was a smile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn to cry awhile
I don’t carry deadweight—I’m no flash in the pan
All right, I’ll set you straight, can’t you see I’m a union man?
I’m lettin’ the cat out of the cage, I’m keeping a low profile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Feel like a fighting rooster—feel better than I ever felt
But the Pennsylvania line’s in an awful mess and the Denver road is about to melt
I went to the church house, every day I go an extra mile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Last night ’cross the alley there was a pounding on the walls
It must have been Don Pasqualli makin’ a two A.M. booty call
To break a trusting heart like mine was just your style
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn to cry awhile
I’m on the fringes of the night, fighting back tears that I can’t control
Some people they ain’t human, they got no heart or soul
Well, I’m crying to the Lord—I’m tryin’ to be meek and mild
Yes, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Well, there’s preachers in the pulpits and babies in the cribs
I’m longin’ for that sweet fat that sticks to your ribs
I’m gonna buy me a barrel of whiskey—I’ll die before I turn senile
Well, I cried for you—now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile
Well, you bet on a horse and it ran on the wrong way
I always said you’d be sorry and today could be the day
I might need a good lawyer, could be your funeral, my trial
Well, I cried for you, now it’s your turn, you can cry awhile

I got to see you baby, I don’t care
It may be someplace, baby, you say where
[Chorus]
I had a dream about you, baby
Had a dream about you, baby
Late last night you come a-rolling across my mind
[Interlude]
You got the crazy rhythm when you walk
You make me nervous when you start to talk
[Chorus]
[Interlude]
Standing on the highway, you flag me down
Said, take me Daddy, to the nearest town
[Chorus]
[Verse]
The joint is jumping
It’s really something
The beat is pumping
My heart is thumping
Spent my money on you honey
My limbs are shaking
My heart is breaking

You kiss me, baby, in the coffee shop
You make me nervous, you gotta stop
[Chorus]
[Interlude]
You got a rag wrapped around your head
Wearing a long dress fire engine red

Always leaving’ somebody behind
Hey, ’round the bend

Well, I seen the whole country through
Just to find Gypsy Lou

Hey, gone again
Gypsy Lou’s ’round the bend

Come you ladies and you gentlemen, a-listen to my song
Sing it to you right, but you might think it’s wrong
Just a little glimpse of a story I’ll tell
’Bout an East Coast city that you all know well
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town
[Verse 2]
Old New York City is a friendly old town
From Washington Heights to Harlem on down
There’s a-mighty many people all milling’ all around
They’ll kick you when you’re up and knock you when you’re down
It’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town
[Verse 3]
It’s a mighty long ways from the Golden Gate
To Rockefeller Plaza ’n’ the Empire State
Mister Rockefeller sets up as high as a bird
Old Mister Empire never says a word
It’s hard times from the country
Living’ down in New York town
[Verse 4]
Well, it’s up in the morning’ trying’ to find a job of work
Stand in one place till your feet begin to hurt
If you got a lot o’ money you can make yourself merry
If you only got a nickel, it’s the Staten Island Ferry
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town
[Verse 5]
Mister Hudson come a-sailing down the stream
And old Mister Minuet paid for his dream
Bought your city on a one-way track
’F I had my way I’d sell it right back
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town
[Verse 6]
I’ll take all the smog in Cal-i-for-ne-ay
’N’ every bit of dust in the Oklahoma plains
’N’ the dirt in the caves of the Rocky Mountain mines
It’s all much cleaner than the New York kind
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town
[Verse 7]
So all you newsy people, spread the news around
You can listen to m’ story, listen to m’ song
You can step on my name, you can try ’n’ get me beat
When I leave New York, I’ll be standing’ on my feet
And it’s hard times in the city
Living’ down in New York town

Handy Dandy, controversy surrounds him
He been around the world and back again
Something in the moonlight still hounds him
Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
[Verse 1]
Handy Dandy, if every bone in his body was broken he would never admit it
He got an all-girl orchestra and when he says
“Strike up the band,” they hit it
Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy
[Verse 2]
You say, “What are ya made of?”
He says, “Can you repeat what you said?”
You’ll say, “What are you afraid of?”
He’ll say, “Nothin’! Neither ’live nor dead.”
[Verse 3]
Handy Dandy, he got a stick in his hand and a pocket full of money
He says, “Darling, tell me the truth, how much time I got?”
She says, “You got all the time in the world, honey”
Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy
[Verse 4]
He’s got that clear crystal fountain
He’s got that soft silky skin
He’s got that fortress on the mountain
With no doors, no windows, no thieves can break in
[Verse 5]
Handy Dandy, sitting with a girl named Nancy in a garden feeling kind of lazy
He says, “Ya want a gun? I’ll give ya one.” She says, “Boy, you talking crazy”
Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
Handy Dandy, pour him another brandy
[Verse 6]
Handy Dandy, he got a basket of flowers and a bag full of sorrow
He finishes his drink, he gets up from the table, he says
“Okay, boys, I’ll see you tomorrow”
Handy Dandy, Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy
Handy Dandy, just like sugar and candy

[Intro]
Don't ever try to change me
I been in this thing too long
There's nothing' you can say or do
To make me think I'm wrong
[Verse 1]
Well, I'm going' off to Libya
There's a guy I gotta see
He's been living there three years now
In an oil refinery
I've got my mind made up
Oh, I have got my mind made up
[Verse 2]
Call your Ma in Tallahassee
Tell her her baby's on the line
Tell her not to worry
Everything is gonna be fine
[Verse 3]
Well, I gave you all my money
All my connections, too
There ain't nothing' in this world, girl
You can say I didn't give to you
I've got my mind made up

You will be alright, girl
Someone's watching' over you
He won't do nothing' to you
Baby that I wouldn't do
[Outro]
Well, if you don't want to see me
Look the other way

I got my mind made up
I got my mind made up

[Verse 1]
Well, I ain’t got my childhood
Or friends I once did know
No, I ain’t got my childhood
Or friends I once did know
But I still got my voice left
I can take it anywhere I go
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine
[Verse 2]
And I’ve never had much money
But I’m still around somehow
No, I’ve never had much money
But I’m still around somehow
Many times I’ve bended
But I ain’t never yet bowed
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine
[Verse 3]
Trouble, oh trouble
I’ve trouble on my mind
Trouble, oh trouble
Trouble on my mind
But the trouble in the world, Lord
Is much more bigger than mine

[Verse 4]
And I never had no armies
To jump at my command
No, I ain’t got no armies
To jump at my command
But I don’t need no armies
I got me one good friend
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine
[Verse 5]
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on
I been shot at just like you
I been kicked and whipped and trampled on
I been shot at just like you
But as long as the world keeps a-turning
I just keep a-turnin’ too
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing’ fine
[Verse 6]
Well, my road might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
My road it might be rocky
The stones might cut my face
But as some folks ain’t got no road at all
They gotta stand in the same old place
Hey, hey, so I guess I’m doing fine

[Verse 1]
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
Summer's almost gone, winter's coming on
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on
[Verse 2]
Papa writes to Johnny, "Johnny, can't you come home ?
Johnny, can't you come home ? Johnny, can't you come home ?"

Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on
[Verse 3]
That silly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
Going home to stay, going home to stay
That silly wind will soon begin and I'll be on my way
And I feel like I just want to travel on
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on
[Verse 4]
There's a lonesome freight at 6.08 coming through the town
I'll be homward bound, I'll be homeward bound
There's a lonesome freight at 6.08 coming through the town
And I feel like I just want to travel on
Done laid around, done stayed around
This old town too long
And it seems like I've got to travel on
And it seems like I've got to travel on
