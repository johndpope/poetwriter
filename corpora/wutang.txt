[Intro: Method Man]
16th Chamber, temple number five
[Method Man]
Somebody said it's on, if it is then I'll be set
To blow a nigga up, with my 
Five Fingers of Death
I bring it to his whole damn fam, understand
If he frontin, on any man down with the Clan
I be comin, for that headpiece you can't cope
For my brother, I even kill a Pope,
 
word to mother
Serial, killa, 
style from the Isle of Stat
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Shit's gettin deep in here, I mean like thick
Niggas lookin all in my face like they want dick
It's about to hit the fan, hit the flo
'
That's all I can stands, and I can't stands no mo'
What is it? Niggas think they bigga
Because they got the
 
finga on the trigga of a biscuit
They don't know I'm wicked, when I start to kick it
With the raw sound, 
wash it down with a Mystic
Better yet a Snapple
, 
nigga want the juice
But he don't want the hassle
Thought they trying to overthrow the castle
Better yet the temple
, 
I'm comin to your town
Black down, the rental, car, the pistol
YAH!
 
If you don't want a burn from Glock
Then beware, I buck shots, meaning what, 
the buck stops
Here
, no more dough will be made
Unless it's being made by who... the 1-6-Ooh
[Interlude: Raekwon] + (Method Man)
Chamber four (1-6-Ooh) Chamber four
Temple number nine, temple number nine
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm the original G-O-D
Making young ladies scream is my specialty
When I go ooh-wah, ooh-wah, ooh-wah, girls wanna get hype
From the funky fresh music that was stereotyped
When I kill, that ol' mad rugged flow
Not sayin Ason, is like a 
duck of disco
Or a disco duck, I'm strictly hip hop
Yo, Ason, what's up? I can't stop...
Wu-Tanging
, flipping the script and
You could test my skills, but niggas must be trippin
Coked up from sniffin
, you're the one who's riffin
I'm not Opie, save that old shit for Andy Griffith
You start to flip, now ya slip, cuz you're slippin
While you sleep I be the God on point, like Scottie Pippen
As I, jump on stage, cold flip a rip a show
Strip or rip a ho, 
ready like Bo
Jackson
 while I'm still taxin, I'm maxin
Relaxin, sittin backs and, laying tracks and
Again and again when I rock this jam
I wanna see 'em up in the air, throw up your hand
Introducin, the one-man band
A child that's wild, now with the style, couldn't stand
Niggas wanna jump, then stepped, to the center
Of the rhyme inventor, MC tormentor
You get jacked and slapped, across the 
MC map
I laugh at ya ass, on a 
horse shack
Come on through I black and blue your whole crew
Then I get rudie with the 
Hong Kong Phooey
The Ol' Dirty Bastard, MC killer
Money maker, Brooklyn, Shaolin style
That I lay down like tile
Gotta hit you up, one blaow, so you better come down...

[Hook]
We will fight till the night is done
We will live our lives tonight as one
We will live our lives tonight as one, one
[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I'm a bad mother-, shout your mouth
Insanity, DVD, how I stretch 'em out
What the stress about? 
INS best out
Fact, you knew that before he left the house
Fresh at the produce section
Gaze at my shine like a showroom necklace
Death wish, stepping in, declaration
I'm checking niggas like test questions
[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Across 110th now, [?]
Camera hawk hawks the sidewalk
When they get to flexing muscle niggas bust you
Hustlers do you, gave you your first toolie
Cutting out of school to pump your first loose leaf
Think graduate to wait, take it out of state, duct tape
Anything of pulse and heroin
Emcees frozen, cuban links golden
Everywhere I'm opening it up, they kill it raw
Math here, I got 'em keep coming back for more
[Verse 3: Method Man]
Yo, man, I'm so turned up, all the marijuana burned up
Y'all don't want the drama, word up
The Wu first up, the game is the world versus us
Y'all was good 'til the world heard us
Y'all ain't want them Clan birds up
Y'all done want your man served up
That'll get the fans worked up
Homie really wanna play, stir it up
I'mma catch me a wave, surfs up
Gliding on the track like this, make me wanna act like this
Make me wanna smack that trick
Make a killer really wanna yap that kid
If he opens up his yap that's it
[Hook]
[Verse 4: GZA]
Mass of minerals in a glass house
Playing the 4th neutrinos will blast out
Letting out verbal thunder bolts
Until the world attract old and younger folks
Charge with the vitality of magnetism
In large reality with massive rhythm
The manual without technical part
From the beginning give off an electrical spark
[Verse 5: Cappadonna]
I respect you if you respect me
Everything's for real, 
WTC
No fake ass shit, don't front the Remy
Break bread, never have pockets empty
Let's get it, flip it up then we can spend it
The money train, killer bees on your brain
W's everywhere, one on your chain
Homeboys for life, please don't change
You can hide at my house, it ain't no thing
If you see the pigs, don't say jack
Call me original, don't say cap
I'm on the low, might be at the murder
Holding off the place y'all cats never heard of
Yeah, chicks wanna peep me out
Nasty ass, want me to pee in their mouth
But now I'm out, about to link with stinks
[Hook]
[Verse 6: U-God]
Bang a few notes up top, we call it beast mode
Forget the street codes, show you like a 
deep throat
It gets rougher, you struggle from the heat stroke
Blast barrels, embrace my leaf smoke
[Park Hillians] radio for back up
Polish your act up, nigga need a back up
Syrup in my cup, no cut, straight up
UG's in the court, never miss a lay up
[Verse 7: RZA]
When the emcees came to live out their names
Some rode the bus, some rode the train
Some motherfuckers wish they never came
When they met the nine swordsmen of Wu-Tang
Nine Maseratis pulls up to this party hard
Body, the party is still, but God body
It's out of shape models coming through with those bottles
End up with these, please, four eyes follow
Pass me a bucket of ice, that's nice
Hit with the rocker, what you say proper
I drink with the copper,
 
show up with a chopper
Stop her, she wanna have a ménage à trois
I can tell by the bra [?]
Do you wish or wish upon a star?
Do you wish or wish upon a star?

[Ghostface Killah]
Y'all be nice to the crackheads,

Word life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out

Official Wu-Tang headbanger
Flood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka
[Raekwon the Chef]
Yo, I drink heavy gallons of Crew, play the big part

[ODB]
Yo, 1-2
Dirt McGirt
Solid tone smith with 6th shots, lick shots
Leave your head like a Shaolin monk with 6 dots
Brooklyn, Zoo, Zoo
Brooklyn... ZOO!
[Cappadonna]
It's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor
Smash pretty boy niggas, crush they karma
Eat bones with alligators, roll
 deep, with my entourage
My whole crew's fresh out the bars
Diggler, AKA the Cab Driver
Drop him off in the middle of fire
Dirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland
Knock niggas out hurtin' my hand
[Method Man]
I remember in the elevators when we was playin' corners
Now we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us,
 (uh)
Staten's where the war is
Where the court system's running out of warrants
Where TNT be jumping out the Taurus
For real I can't call it
You see I love Lucy cuz she lawless
Exactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is
Snitch niggas swallow your tongue
Already know the island I'm from
And y'all don't want no problems with them
[Genius/GZA]
We got a history, full of lightning victories
Conceptual breakthrough it ain't no mystery
Long vision, from giants in every way
Rap czars,
 magnificent flows for every day
From the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills
Incredible rhymes, encouraging skills
From rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous
We hit 'em fast, with an effortless performance
MCs start fleeing in flocks
Especially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock
[Inspectah Deck]
We grindin', down to the bone
My name grounded in stone
I'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with Chrome
Mr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome
Shining like a hundred thousand in stones
Move mountains with poems, 
got a jones for dinero
1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows
The hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings
Only dime dikes, with minds right, we choose Queens
[Masta Killa]
Yeah we wild like rockstars who smash guitars
Yo son split his face with the toast, 
he ain't ghost
It's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke
One toke brains float,
 shot to the throat
Before the smoke hit, witness the killing
On the crime scene
Body on the block
Eyes open from the shock
Of being popped in the neck
Yet he still had a lit cigarette between his fingers
Danger when you step into the chamber with the master
Disaster, gotta blast ya, cuz I hafta
[U-God]
The rat pack is back from the island of Stat'
Leave you cursed off, cuz you worship the gat
The first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff
Blow the bouncer's head off, let him floss he the boss
Handcuffed, to the turntables like, Wizard Theodore
See it's pure, let it rain curly ounces
Bang him with the thing that hang from the trousers
You don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast
That nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, this goes for all my brothers and sisters locked down
For all my peoples incarcerated, for those who ain't make it
Yo, in the housing, thousands seen early graves
Victims of worldly ways, memories stays engraved
All my live brothers, is locked down with high numbers
The young hunger, blind to these lies, they die younger
In this 
New World the Order
 slaughter men, women, and children
Ten feet gates surround the building keep us sealed in
The projects,
 
lifeless like a vietnam vet
Constant war, sever threats of enemy conquest
Crooked cops comb my building complex
 that's in the rumble
Streets are like a jungle
, 
can't let my cypher crumble
Vivid thoughts, 
Devils resort to trick knowledge
They kick garbage, lust for chicks and quick dollars
I know the pain the game bring, I did the same thing
Spaced out in the staircase, performing a sting
It's hard to keep control
, 
I bless those who seek a scroll
Trying to reach a whole nation and break the sleeper hold
Not a role model, I walk a hard road to follow
I sold bottles of sorrow then chose poems and novels
The gospel was told
, 
some souls it swallowed whole
Mentally they fold
, and 
they eventually sold
Their life and times, deadly like the virus design
But too, minute to dilute, the scientist mind
You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
[Masta Killa]
A voice cries from 
the wilderness of the North
A representation of the families that lost one
All victims of incarceration
Or other divisions of the family structure
Youths are injected with serums that leads
To skin irritations, babies being born with
Disfigurations, experimentations
On their faces there bear
 worry-ations
Of mothers that carry the pain
Of blood stained streets where sisters mourn and wail
Fifth brothers been slain from hails of gun fire
It lightly begins to rain screams of terror
Are hidden by the passing trains
This can't be little Hussein, his uncle cried
As he drops to his nephew's side, holding his cane
Just give me a name, of who has inflicted this
Bitter sickness, and left us to witness
[U-God]
Yeah, yo
Curses from war, innocent blood spills for days
Soothe in godly ways, hands, solemn in praise
Tree of life, more precious than Wu is golden game
The wise self flourish inherit, Halls of Fame
Crime visions in my blood got me, locked in prison
While we die hard living people whine about religion
, vision
Blow, spin, and sin and killing what's revealing
It's a never ending battle with no ending or beginning, listen
Zero process, progress
, 
become the hunted
America's most wanted
, 
good life flaunted, want it
Some love the speed, some satisfy a need
Some want to be down, young gun seed, jungle breed
The strong must feed, someone die, someone bleed
One flew astray, and it caught my little seed
Can it be, the ice have us trife life, made me grab the knife
The righteous man was beat with many stripes, pipes
Take in my energy, breath and know the rest
Cause the good die young and the hard die best
You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
[RZA]
Y'all bitches love dances, and pulling down your pants
While your man's on tour, your spending up his advances
Your friends ain't shit, all they do is drink, smoke, and suck dick
The whole projects is trapped in stench
You either high school drop-outs
, 
one to three cop-outs
Fifteen years old, shorty ass and top out
Ninety-nine cent beer
 drinking pussy stinking
Fucking so much your ass and titties start shrinking
New World Order slave trade, minimum wage, Medicaid
Can a devil fool a Muslim nowadays
Inside my lab, I'm going mad
Took two drags off the
 
blunts
, 
and started breaking down the flag
The blue is for the Crips, the red is for the Bloods
The whites for the cops
, and the stars come from the clubs
Or the slugs that ignites, through the night, by the dawn
Early light,
 
why is sons fighting for the stripe
[Method Man]
As we dwell through this concrete hell, calling it home
Mama say, take your time young man and build your own
Don't wind up like your old dad
Still searching for them glory days he never had
So many bad want to scheme for American dream
, 
no more kings
The cash rule everything now
, we going down
These babies looking up to us, it's up to us
The Million Man March MC's
, 
get on the bus
But envy, greed, lust, and hate, separate
Though the devil mind state blood kin cannot relate
No longer, brothers, we unstable
Like Kane when he slew Abel, killing each other
You can't party your life away
Drink your life away
Smoke your life away
Fuck your life away
Dream your life away
Scheme your life away
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way
Cause your seeds grow up the same way

[Intro: Method Man]
Wake up... wake up
Wake up...
[Verse 1: Method Man]
Wake up, get a hold of your life, go get your cake up
The motto in the streets is you eat, or you get ate up
Straight up, you tired of waiting, go get your weight up
My peoples tired of waiting for reparations to pay us
Screaming Jesus can save us, I, I get the Bentley if I save up
But that's just another trick to enslave us
Push the minimum wages
Put, put our fathers up in them cages
Then watch out when mother struggled to raise us
But, but my ambition won't let me live in this poor condition
That doesn't care about color, creed, or your religion
Priests, politicians gotta listen to opposition
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
From my position, we still ain't got a pot to piss in
[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Allah said to save the babies from the cold
Pour wisdom in the cup so the truth overflows
Still, knowledge is that bread that keeps us well-fed
Old time religion will not bring us satisfaction
Without action now who can disagree with me?
God is not a mystery, there's nowhere in history
That you could show and prove to me
But still you face east and nod your head to me religiously
I'm G-O-D, to infinity, for real
[Hook: sample]
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it yeah, just you and me
[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Poor reparations, the Bush administration
Unequality, martial law, segregation
False hood, false teaching, false education
Now's the time for us to come amongst this nation
They deceiving us, they don't believe in us
They believe in that Cream like Julius Caesar
I'm like Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X with the heaters
Ripping the chains of the remains of all of the leaders
Never worship the image of evil swine eaters
I'm on the back of the bus with two fine divas
We in the jungle of life, but never jungle fever
I'm God-body all day long, spiritual life lessons
That I recite with song
Trying to wake up everybody, can't we all get along?
For all my people that's out there persevering through the storm
Black fist, Staten Island, stand up, stand strong
Penetrate through the gate and bring the Clan along
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Wake up and realise the times
That we living in the world is getting more iller than ever
Thought we was chillin', striving change for the better
But it was a dream like Martin Luther
He had a vision that could move a mountain
Protect one another, that's world to my brother Malcolm
As-salamu alaykum, alaykum as-salam
We want justice, police supposed to protect and serve
And then they shoot us down like wild animals
The nerve of them cold-hearted killers
With blue suits slaying our black youth
The earth cries from all the blood that's being spilled
We need a solution fast, get InshAllah bill
Let me educate them, translate it meaning God's will
It goes all in together, together how we are
To stand with a plan, provided we down to fall
And that's the Willie Lynch tactics that separated the masses
Taught us all to think backwards
[Reversed sample: RZA]
[Hook]
We gonna change the world (x5)

W ostatnich dniach do życia obudziły się dinozaury. Jak to zwykle bywa w takich sytuacjach uczucia są mieszane. Z jednej strony wierni fani będą bronić nad życie dzieła idoli, nawet jeśli to skamieniały syf. Z drugiej malkontenci nie uznają za wartościowe czegokolwiek od zespołu, który umieścili już w muzeum (lub czasem na wysypisku historii).
Jak jest w wypadku premiery ostatniego albumu legendy grupowego rapu z Nowego Jorku? Czy skład, który zainspirował i nadal inspiruje tysiące innych artystów ma rację bytu po 21 latach od zawiązania się? Rozłożę to na czynniki pierwsze, a tymczasem...
Oczywistym było dla mnie, że nie można A Better Tomorrow porównywać do debiutu sprzed dwóch dekad - sam rap, a i kultura hip hop zmieniły się od tego czasu diametralnie. Trudno jednak powstrzymać się od zestawienia z wydanym 7 lat temu albumem 
8 Diagrams
. Dla przypomnienia: dla RZA'y był to czas eksperymentów zarówno w kwestii beatmakingu (widać starania w celu dopasowania się do ówczesnych trendów), jak i rapowania, którego z jego strony pojawiło się niespodziewanie dużo. Kolejnym zdziwieniem była spora liczba featów. Wszystko to złożyło się na inny niż znany do 8 Diagrams obraz grupy. Moim zdaniem A Better Tomorrow stanowi racjonalną ewolucję obranej na poprzednim albumie drogi - dobre czynniki zostały rozwinięte, a gorsze ukrócone, co strawia, że ABT jest płytą o klasę lepszą od poprzedniczki.
Przed wydaniem płyty fani zarzucani byli informacjami o niesnaskach w grupie, kłótniach o kasę, ścieraniu się gigantycznych ego... Jak jednak powiedział Raekwon w 
Daily Show u Jona Stewarta
 - Wu to rodzina, która mimo kłótni stanie razem. Taka, która w tym co robi jest MVP, co daje nie tylko priorytety, ale i obowiązki - tworzą trendy i aktywizują hip hop. Dlatego nie mogą zawiesić rękawic na kołek. O tym głównie jest ta płyta.
Rzadko mi się zdarza rozpocząć słuchanie od pierwszego kawałka, ale "Ruckus", to dla fanów Wu słowo-klucz. Okazało się to świetną decyzją 
"Ruckus In B Minor"
 to intro idealne. RZA stworzył kolejne dzieło na swoim najwyższym poziomie... i oddał je Rickowi Rubinowi do dopieszczenia. Efekt na prawdę powala - mało jest producentów z taką umiejętnością godzenia klasyki ze świeżością. Jeśli chodzi o rap... to Wu-Tang. To jak tekstem bawią się tu 
Inspectah Deck
, czy 
Ghostface Killah
 tworzy na twarzy sporego banana.
Jak w dobrym filmie akcja po początkowym trzęsieniu ziemi tylko wzrasta. Dostajemy więc ponure i klimatyczne 
"Felt"
, motywujące 
"40th Street Black / We Will Fight"
 ze świetną sekcją dętą i zwrotką RZA'y, który na tym polu zalicza wyraźny progres w stosunku do wyczynów sprzed 7 lat. W sumie przy takiej różnorodności artystów każdy kawałek niesie w sobie tematycznie coś ciekawego - smaczki dla fanów Wu, jak i świeżość i najwyższą jakość dla słuchaczy rapu w ogóle.
Przejdźmy zatem do kwestii bardziej technicznych. Zwrotki na płytę dali wszyscy żyjący członkowie Clanu. Każdy cieszy się wielkim uznaniem i sukcesami w karierze solowej - dlatego jeśli doda się wspominane już przeze mnie ograniczenie raperskich zapędów RZA'y, który wyraźnie jednak odstaje na tym polu od reszty, mogliśmy w ciemno mieć pewność, że dostaniemy to, co w tej muzyce najlepsze. Punche Method Mana, rzeczowa nawijka Raekwona... każdy ma tu coś do zaoferowania - zobaczcie 
tytułowy kawałek
. Nawet śpiewane refreny (kiedyś nie do pomyślenia) pasują tu idealnie - najlepszym przykładem hook Nathaniela w kawałku 
"Ron O'Neal"
Warstwę muzyczną najlepiej podsumuje tocząca się po podłodze szczęka. RZA, Mathematics i 4th Disciple wykorzystali swoje umiejętności w 100%. To Wu-Tang muzycznie zupełnie inny niż ten z lat 90. - w większości pozbawiony tego brudnego, undergroundowego sznytu. Nie znaczy jednak, że w jakimkolwiek stopniu gorszy. Każdy zabieg producencki na tej płycie, czy to odwołanie do chlubnej tradycji, czy spojrzenie w przyszłość, poparty jest olbrzymim doświadczeniem i bardzo przemyślany. Wykorzystanie sekcji dętej, organów, chóru, wokalnych sampli, czy żywych wokali - wszystko mi tu pasuje. Idealnym przykładem jest tu hołd dla klasyka Dusty Springfield 
"Son Of a Preacher Man"
 zawarty w kawałku 
"Preacher's Daughter"
 - Clan na gitarowym samplu z sekcją dętą wyszedł świetnie.
Podsumowując - nie mam wątpliwości, że album ten zajmie zasłużone wysokie miejsca w podsumowaniach tego roku. Mam jednocześnie nadzieję, że na kolejne dzieło ekipy z 
Shaolin
 nie będę musiał czekać 7 lat... Wracając do początku i cytując Method Mana: 

[Intro: Killah Priest, Raekwon]
Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo
[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
When you're sexually frustrated, plus waiting for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour
, 
polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die
[Raekwon]
I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy
You getting high right? Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you
[Hook: Raekwon]
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
[Verse 2: RZA]
My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles
So he put popsicles on her nipples to make her sex passion
Triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade
[Hook]
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
[Verse 3: Masta Killah]
Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac,
 God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, 
the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hittin all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the Syndrome
[Outro: Raekwon and others]
Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up
AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly
 (4x)
Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly

[Intro]
Like that y'all, like that, you're like that, a-like that y'all

Like that y'all, like that, you're like that, a-like that y'all
Like that y'all, like that, you're like that, a-like that y'all
[Verse 1: SWV]
Anticipation of what's to come
I'm so happy that I'm the lucky one
So long I've waited but it's never too late for love
It feels so right, baby that it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because
[Hook]
Anything for you I am gonna try to
I'm bonafide, body's just for you
Pleasure every way you can ride
Just to get with you
If you choose to
[Verse 2: SWV]
Whatever method used is alright with me
As long as you get to where you need to be
This is the vision made for both of our eyes to see
It feels so right, it can't be wrong
Where I am weak baby you make me strong
I'm down for you and whatever you want to do
It's all up to you because
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Ol Dirty Bastard]
Dirty Bas
, style cuts like glass
Gotta gotta keep it high power to the mass
Yo Gods, another-like platinum hit
Party people all around be sayin that's the shit
[Method Man]
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
Tical
, hailing from the 
Shaolin Isle
It be me the killer bee, on the M-I-C
With the S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
Me me going downtown, let me see
If we all and together now, make it mo' better now
Listen I ain't sweating no competition
Flow, going mad low like I'm dissing
[U-God]
Another chapter from the Wu-Tang group
Take a look or a peak, killer bees never sleep
Nonstop put you on the chopping block
Unorthodox, attitude to melting pot
[Method Man]
I'll do anything, I'm so into you
Right here, I'm Weak, downtown with the Wu
Kaboom, guess who stepped in the room
The S-S-double-double-U to the V-V
[Hook]

(come on in)
[Ol Dirty] *singing*
Dinn-dnn-dnn-ta-dnn
(come on in)
Dinn-dnn-ta-dnn, dinn DNN DAH
(come on, come on, come on in)
Dnn-da-duh-duh-DAH, you BITCH ASS niggas!
(come on in, come on, come on, come on in)
Intro/Chorus: Ol Dirty/Osirus
As high as Wu-Tang get
Allah allow us pop this shit
Just like black shoe fit
If you can't wear it, well don't fuck with it!
Verse One: The Genius/GZA
Yo, too many songs, 
weak rhymes that's mad long
Make it brief Son, half short and twice strong
No doubt, it took time searchin, eventually
It was prime urgent, for you to examine the rhyme merchant
Lace MC's with styles when they rhyme drunk
On a label hunt, until twenty thou, out the trunk
Eight Diagram
 
sword swinga
 armored tank force
RZA throw in the disc but then change the bank source
You can't flow, must be the speech impediment
You got lost off the snare off Impeach the President
Whether in Amsterdam smokin seven grams of green
Then you pack, a thousand white teens in tight jeans
This Witty Unpredictable shot is critical
To analytical analogy, insurance policies why
Said he know that sounds define the note
Couldn't recognize, blast him the fuck behind the ropes
Too many dope niggas I see starvin
Catch a single deal, a possible plea bargain
Wu slay regardles to whom or what, five mics five nights
Hang him from the balcony, drop twenty-five flights
A fugitive bass playin rap czar
Smoke the cigars, his prints on the strings of his guitar
Chorus
Verse Two: Method Man/Iron Lung
Tical got a hold on ya
, doin exactly
What the fuck I mariju-wanta, dis nigga nasty
Deep in the dirty dungeon, buggin, lovin
The ways these rhymes keep comin, at cha splash ya
Get your head piece fractured, with killer cuts
From the Shropshire Slasher,
 rip shit up
Got this whole thing Tang mastered, sho nuff
An MC too good to be touched, 
John John
Bring the phenomenon
, 
I cold crush
MC, inferiorities they froze up, ice cold
As we move on, saga unfold
Captivated by a saga that go untold, like Goldfinger
Caught up in a cliffhanger
Yo 
I-N-S
 
another code red, danger
, 
break out the vest
Now it's tactical warfare, it's all here
Come with your shield and hardware, it be on here
Don't ever roam
, 
in the naked city
Eight million stories none pretty
Bomb em wit the 
Witty Unpredictable
, conditionin be critical
Peace to Tang
, gettin high on your physical, dis next drink
Is a toast to your memory
When I go how many niggas gon' remember me
Chorus

[Intro/Hook: Madame D]
Light is shinin.. beauty sunshine
Here comes one-time.. the ball was so fine
Heat is blazin.. the kids were playin
His partner was shady.. tryin to slave the babies
[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyyo they didn't know the cop was crooked, he had blow out in Brooklyn
All this while he let the fiends cook it
The baseheads stirred it up, plus they got to blow it up
Dropped it off in the PJ's and they bigged it up
Then one day, shit jumped off real crazy
The middle of a bathroom they find an old lady
No clothes, half of her tongue, ear missin
The killer had to be mad smart, he wore mittens
Even though her leg was bitten
Crackheads point the finger at Detective Slick Morris Gittins
Paleface cop who done popped the best
And got the chop on his neck from when he knocked Celeste
It was a slug, drug, he pressured everybody on the block
Some niggas know him as the Godson of Gotti
And his black partner, he was scared to speak
He saw how they planted weapons on these kids in the street
He saw like over fifty bodies in like fifty-two weeks
He saw his colleague pick up money before leavin his beat
They call him desk duty, Robocop
Younger dudes call him Freddy Krugs from the way he walk on the block
[Hook]
[Raekwon the Chef]
Heard the disturbance out the window, oh shit they got my son
Pulled over his Tempo, Brenda dropped the endo
Had her little nephew with her yo she didn't care
They always harassed her, until she blew the captain with a razor
His partner turned red in his waist, Mase done smacked her
With the walkie, yoked her then slammed her on her face
He bugged on her like she was drugged, plugged one in her
The fifth relaxed her like a big thug pistol whipped her
Heard she was dusted, musta been the way they threw the cuffs on her
She broke the shits, went and rushed the kid
Wavin her hands, she had a half an axe, all in her tracks
He grabbed her by the air, she broke his jaw it cracked
More cops arrived, they both bloodied down by the five
Wildest niggas just smilin cause it look live
They gave her forty years in New Orleans, callin me wodie
Shorty was young, by three days had a great bid
[Hook]
[GZA]
You're just worms in the worst part of the apple that's rotten
You squirm and you turn from the right, still plottin
All slimy cause you stay grimy, petty crimey cat
You sometime me, don't need to remind me about
Livin in the core, with the scramblers in front of the store
The bum holdin the door, the mugging no one saw
We played ball in the alley where dope was shot raw
And the school they kept flawed, plus the lowest test scores
Small percentage determined to strengthen they position
Transformation from critical to, stable condition
But it still be obstacles on niggas that's optical
Watchin you like salt-water sharks that's tropical
The money was the root and it's the instinct to make it
With they pockets and fridge naked, many aim to take it
Whether - hold up, set up, stabbin or a wet up
Just to know it was the kid next door fizzucked your head up
Once he fell short, frequently visit the courts
And for some, another way out, is music and sports
That's why I, keep the rhyme just as fly as a shot
That won the championship, with just oh on the clock
[Hook] - repeat 2X

"It's true - the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang, could be dangerous!"
[Method Man]
Uh-huh, 
Mr. Biggs
, 
Trackmasters
 (woo!)
It's a Wu-Tang official right here y'know
[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, the employees of the year yeah we're back to work
We took time off, while other rappers got jerked
Shit's bout to change now, it's a shame how
Things ain't the same but I'm back in the game now
And as we step in the door, we cause panic
Yep, 
the usual suspects
, we at it
Vet status, y'all went a week with the belt
Few chicks felt your style, now you feelin yourself
Meet your maker, I dropped you at eight years old
I got stock in your flow and crops to sharehold
Crops with the prose where cops won't dare go
Got top centerfolds too hot to wear clothes
Still me - always have and will be
Ill G - it's silly to hate but feel free
Hey - hear what I say, they gotta pay
And my return is like Christ, declare the holiday
[Hook: Ron Isley]
Back in the game now.. copped me some weed now
My people bout to eat now.. shit's bout to change now
Back in the game now.. all my niggas in the hood now
Better catch up now.. shit's bout to change now
[Method Man]
Uh, y'all see I'm in the street strugglin
Young dumb and thuggin, give a FUCK about nuttin
Stuck at rock bottom, tryin to come up on somethin
Pumpin from sundown to sun-up, we hustlin
Vision my nigga now get in where you fit in
And see prison, as just the high cost of livin the life
Ante up cause if you blow the dice
On that O-Z, Dorothy ain't goin home tonight
That's on e'rythang, put it on the kids and the wife
Been buryin my folks ever since they raised the price on the coke
Searchin for a quick antidote
Mo' money, mo' problems to cope
[GZA]
We were at the same table when the chips were checked
A gamblin +Rebel+ who +Inspects+ the +Deck+
Just when you thought we would fold our hand
Against all odds we raised the bet like we changed the plans
It was live on air but in between station breaks
I was holdin a pair and just made the table stakes
Split the demos, put insurance on tapes
A safeguard against the crusaders in capes
If I double down they say the Gods are sharks
If we win against the house they thought the cards was marked
We draw hit after hit from a royal flush menu
While the dealer promoted the full house venue
A spade in the club with the heart to wear diamonds
The high roller who got credit upon signin
They look puzzled when I shuffle, most of 'em stunned by the hustle
Recourse of bluff game's your muscle
[Hook] - 0.75X
[Raekwon] Say what? ("Shaolin shadowboxing!")
[R. Isley] Shit's bout to change..
[Raekwon the Chef]
Aiyyo, on rainy days I sit back and count ways on
How to get rich
, coolin with a mean ill Jamaican bitch
Banana coat matchin with the ratchet
Lil' black weave sweatpants style, air force is actin
Jump in the 6, kicks look crisp, talkin bout the bird
Flow through your hood in the mean tints that's giant
It's like the family that flipped on you for lyin
Buried you alive, left your whore cryin
We on your floor look more doors
Dey ain't ate either, I hope y'all niggas is armed
And when we get there, all my niggas in the mix
Yeah Shallah Lex, Diamond got me buyin Louis Rich wear
[Ghostface Killah]
Most people say the Clan was missin since I got dropped offa radio
Overnight your whole style was bitten in the process
Everybody switched they names like
Whatcha call it, any fast (?)
It was the Gods that repped that, sharkskin dark skinned bitches
Clarks from Digi left the game dizzy
Ooh got busy, that dancey shit slid through
We had to stay hood cause that's who we been through
RZA came through, mastermind got the cash and power
Proof that power plastered divine classical lines
Mathematical rhymes, the style is unbearable
Now niggas with the radical shines
It's Ghost-Deini, every coast need me
We back motherfucker that's right, it's the 
W.T.C
World Trade Center, Wu-Tang Clan
We brought so much heat that we was givin you tans an' shit
[Hook]
{*Ron Isley ad libs to fade*}

[Intro: U-God]
Give me the cue
[Verse 1: U-God]
Skip the introduction proceed to lip function
The junction get rushed by some grimy people busting weed
Splatter your melon like some Attica felons
Use a firearm good
, Bloods go for heart swelling
Insert the spasm, 
yes the dirty herb has him
Thoroughbred thugs insert the fantasm
Verbal smarts, spark the word, visit my scripture
Exotic wine
, 
holding nine
 
Picasso pictures
When the rhyme pivot you now, limit your chance
Bodyguard the lyric with unlimited stance
Words seem to zing on down to Beijing
When we touch down, would you crown renowned kings
[Verse 2: Method Man]
There's no honor amongst thieves
Street pharmaceutical stack like Genovese
The Four Devils
 
tempt madmen but not these
We profound hardcore sound
 
to MCs, thumbs down, prepare
Killa bees it be warfare, this the year
Niggas gotta take you off of here
, 
hold the square
If we go there we go gritty and spread fear
Through this rap city, call the mayor
My 
razor sharp darts
 
be like cold stares
The smell of fear make my nostrils flair
, truth or dare?
Ask yourself can you compare to these niggas in the hood
Johnny B. Goode
 
or he be gone yeah
The struggle goes on, you've been warned
PLO from here to Lebanon, how many bomb
Must we drop in the Ninety-Now?
Walk a mile in my shoes, get the street news from Meth-Tical
[Break: RZA]
Glocks'll be spitting, you gots to be kidding
Aiyo kid you gots to be kidding
Or Glocks'll be spitting
You gots to be kidding yo
[Verse 3: RZA]
It's common sense how I master my circumference
, 
you dense
I get locked the fuck up, released on my own recognizance
Can't be judged, 
young bloods bust back like scuds
Wu-Tang hovers one thousand notches above
MC level
, 
yo, I stay highs like treble
Foes who oppose get plucked like rose petals
Arresting and holding, 
penetrate forbidden regions
Wack MCs only lasting one season
The morale was low at the corral
Adjective pronouns had no style
, your weak proposal
Aim for the official, initial is 
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah
All that other bullshit ain't permissible
Annual increase of the Wu-Tang Manual
Handles to keep all this Hip Hop shit tangible
Illegible, 
every egg ain't edible
My tracks remain 'Unforgettable' like Ol' Nat Cole
Got to catch this paper to buy Shaquasia a glacier
Nebuchadnezzar skyscraper
Understanding the continents of Africa and Asia
And free the Black Man from enslaved labor, Wu-Tang
[Interlude: Masta Killa]
The weight of the fam is on our back and we can't fall
Victim to this long hall of fame, meaning nothing
We came to punish the glutton with a substance
That can't be contained, Wu-Tang
[Interlude: Method Man]
Motherfuckers
We be seeing y'all asses when we walk up in the club
Y'all all in the back
Scared to speak, we speak cause you scared
Punk motherfucker, we know what time it is
[Interlude: Raekwon]
All you been seeing is upsets in the boxing shit, right
It's like come on man
This nigga fucked up motherfucking Whitaker
Dang, he caught Whitaker
He caught Whitaker a long time ago
Mike got touched
Then Mike got touched by Holyfield
Hey Mike's, Mike's gonna forfeit this fight
He ain't fighting McDermit
He ain't fighting
Nope
Whattup
You talking bout he, what he, what he, what he did
Told them he cut his eye, in sparring
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Stella D'oro wrap breadsticks
, 
David Berkowitz
Einstein birthed a hit, now nurture it
M.G.M. front row seat tonight
, 
no gems
Purify, cleanse, ran into some beef up in the men's
Fix your sawed off, Wu-Tang tore me off the cross
All you saw was white meat, skin hanging off
These is words from the Arch Bishop, 
some call it six up
The Betty Crocker Marvel cake
, snakes will miss a
Wax janitor, black 
Jack Mulligan
 from Canada
Slam dance
, tarantula style, you's a fan of the
Monopoly king, Slavic poetry
Carnegie Hall's
 off the hook, let's push through the armory
Mack truck hitting soloist, Soul Controllers
Behold of the thousand teeth
 fist, swift and boneless
[Outro: RZA]
You know cause Wu-Tang is invincible, you know what I mean
It's Wu-Tang Forever God
We gonna get down with that W
You gonna get down with that W
That's that Wu, that's that Wisdom
That's the 
Wisdom of the Universe
That's the truth, of Allah, for the Nation of the Gods
YouknowhatI'msayin
We breaking egg through these days God
YouknowhatI'msayin
We got the fucking way
We got the medicine for your sickness
Out here, ya knowhatImean
I was telling Shorty like
Yo Shorty, you don't even gotta go to summer school
Pick up the Wu-Tang double CD
And you'll get all the education you need this year
YouknowhatImean
Their poisoned minds can't comprehend this shit
Word man it's Wu-Tang Forever God
Niggas can't fuck with these lyrics God
YouknowhatI'msayin
Knamean
Oh hell no, none of this shit
C'mon man -- beats, lyrics man, y'all niggas
Niggas can't even understand half this shit
I think niggas ain't gonna figure it out til the year Two-G
(Wax niggas ass for free or fee) Word
Yo, you know what
The next Wu-Tang album ain't even coming out until 2000
YaknowhatImean
That's just gonna come back with a comet
You hear, we gonna bring a comet
Check for that shit in the millenium
YouknowhatImean? So, yo, y'all niggas man
Be the resurrection
The Gods is here man
Born Gods is here

[U-God]
Hard days of work
You had a hard day at work baby
I want you to sit down, relax
While I soak you in my mentals
Backrub style, watch this, yo, yo
Massage, peppermint oil, shampoo and pears
Cinnamin, aloe, natural for you hair
Soak lavender soap, coconut conditioning
Honey lather, blood flowing, love listening
Motion lotion, breeze, over the ocean
Lovers, bath crystals, lovers sponge scrubbers
Hot milk bath, steam shower rubbin
Diesel splash,
 
long lovin in your oven
Bake it off, break it off 'til it gets soft
Passion fruit, pussy cat, want to touch it off
In and out, fragrance patience, Hershey's Kisses, Guinness Stout
Stress reliever soak your feet, air them out
Brain message, think about pink
Stress relieving, no dishes in the sink
Upper lower, left, right, neck don't play
Back rub, 
Calgon, take me away
Waterfall beads, streams, plush and lavish
Comfort me through all the damn madness
Night breeze at sea, sipping tea
You and your queen melodies, and trees, 85 degrees
Jet skis breeze...
Sprinkle water on chocolate, butter scotch flowers
Vapor action, tropical sunshower
Baby powder, relax, feel for an hour
Sand suntan, snuggled up snug
Snowey days, fireplace, oriental rug
Thugs, lay on the couch, pull it out, perfect balance
Chemical stimuli, two tokes off the chalace
Complete silence, what surround us
Whats the finest, wrapped in cold sheets
Vanilla apple heat, 
flutes play jazz music
, puffy pillow suites
Breakfast in bed, early morning sun treats
Sunset level, suprise sunrise, sail
Lay on the couch, while I clip your toenails
Dreams of peaches and cream steam secret spells
Soft spoken gospel, Barry White acapell
Violin, good medicine, sound swell
Sunshine life, love right without the hell
Taste sugar, quiet storm, seasick
Slowdance drink, like nights over Egypt
Having, stabbing, calm chilling now we rolling
Company, ice cream licking now we holding
Gentle force, warm tingle of the golden
Open loose, ice cubes, kiss your belly
Alcohol, palm trees, peanut butter jelly
Almond twirl, fantastic melodies
Soon, taste these spoons
Wiping me with toon, fly wine, quiet storm
Now it's high noon, raspberry spices
Cherry breath, drink from the mountain, sip the very best
Sounds of the shore, 
every winter is a war
Paradise life, recipe now pour
Musicness, model, gentle mental
Wash away your sorrow, 
Fantasy Island
Put the message in the bottle
Carry you through, the threshold, do my duty
Happy ending, go to rest Sleeping Beauty
Yo, this is that body shop shit
Love love slam
Edible underwear, champagne, bubble bath
Have your snack on that ass that
Know what I mean?
Massaging these melodies
Put that gangsta shit on the shelf
Blow winds, blow, through your hair
Sea breeze sticks and shit
Right right
[Method Man]
When your around boo
Come and chop this mother fucking beat you stank-ass trick

[Intro: Sample from Shaolin vs. Wu Tang]
"Shaolin shadowboxing and the Wu-Tang sword style. If what you say is true, the Shaolin and the Wu-Tang could be dangerous. Do you think your Wu-Tang sword can defeat me?"
"En garde, I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style."
[Hook: RZA]
Bring da motherfucking ruckus
Bring da motherfucking ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfucking ruckus
Bring da motherfucking ruckus
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Ghostface catch the blast of a hype verse
My Glock burst, leave in a hearse, I did worse
I come rough, tough like an elephant tusk
Ya head rush,
 
fly like Egyptian musk
Aww shit Wu-Tang Clan spark the wicks an'
However I master the trick just like Nixon
Causing terror, quick damage your whole era
Hardrocks is locked the fuck up or found shot
P.L.O. style, hazardous cause I wreck this dangerous
I blow spots like Waco Texas
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I watch my back like I'm locked down, hardcore
Hitting sound, watch me act bugged and tear it down
Illiterate type asshole, songs going gold no doubt
And you watch a corny nigga fold
Yeah they fake and all that carrying gats but yo
My Clan rolling like forty Macs
Now ya act convinced, I guess it makes sense
Wu-Tang, yo soooooo, represent
I wait for one to act up
Now I got him backed up
Gun to his neck now, react what
And that's one in the chamber
Wu-Tang banger, 36 styles of danger
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's banging
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hanging
Bust this,
 
I'm kicking like Seagal, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum, I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shock ya knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic,
 
I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the 
microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty-ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger
So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on
[Hook]
[
Verse 4: GZA]
I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fucking up MC troops
I break loose,
 
and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creeping up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back *swish*,
 
giving bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip,
 
tell me who is him
I blow up his fucking prism,
 
make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it, come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wetting cream,
 
I ain't wetting fame
Who selling cain, I'm giving out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushing roulette
Slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fucking ruckus

[Intro: RZA]
Bring da bring da muthafucking ruckus
En garde,
 I'll let you try my Wu-Tang style
[Hook: RZA]
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da mother, bring da motherfuckin ruckus
Bring da motherfuckin ruckus
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Something new from my real live raps and so catch this
While I kick a verse like chapters
I'm all of that, proceed with the militant act
With the rugged 
Timberlands or with boots that's black
But on the real, 
I'm cold like blue steel
Out to catch a hit and make a mill, chill
Maintain yourself Black, you're strapping all of that
But you ain't got shit in this shack Jack
That's my word, I'm used to beef and I can eat it mad raw
And pick it out my gold teeth
But yo back to the subject, Wu's trying to get wrecked yo
Pass the weed thru your shit god mic check, need a little meth yo
True, back to me flipping you and your so called zoo
You got nothing on a nigga from Staten
A drunk monk, smoking mad skunk and stacking
I didn't need rap shit to get me on, I was a crimey
Driving a Benz hearing my man's song
And when shit gone broke out, everybody got smoked out
And cops drove the wrong route
Don't act evil and possess to hurt me, 
forty guns be flowing in your face
Who wants some
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
I rip it hardcore, like porno-flick bitches
I roll with groups of ghetto bastards with biscuits
Check it, my method on the microphone's banging
Wu-Tang slang'll leave your headpiece hanging
Bust this, I'm kicking like Segall, Out for Justice
The roughness, yes the rudeness, ruckus
Redrum I verbally assault with the tongue
Murder one, my style shot your knot like a stun-gun
I'm hectic, I wreck it with the quickness
Set it on the microphone, and competition get blown
By this nasty ass nigga with my nigga, the RZA
Charged like a bull and got pull like a trigger
So bad, stabbing up the pad with the vocab, crab
I scream on your ass like your dad, bring it on
[Hook]
[Verse 4: GZA]
Yo, I'm more rugged than slaveman boots
New recruits, I'm fucking up MC troops
I break loops, and trample shit, while I stomp
A mudhole in that ass, cause I'm straight out the swamp
Creeping up on site, now it's Fright Night
My Wu-Tang slang is mad fucking dangerous
And more deadly than the stroke of an axe
Chopping through your back
Giving bystanders heart-attacks
Niggas try to flip, tell me who is him
I blow up his fuckin prism
Make it a vicious act of terrorism
You wanna bring it, so fuck it
Come on and bring the ruckus
And I provoke niggas to kick buckets
I'm wetting CREAM I ain't wetting fame
Who selling gain I'm giving out a deadly game
It's not the Russian it's the Wu-Tang crushin
Roulette, slip up and get fucked like Suzette
Bring da fuckin ruckus
[Hook]

Billy Danze: Representing 1 7 1 8, dangerously
Cousin, you know the drill
Lil Fame: Respect mine we Brooklyn bound, bound!
[Method Man]
Playing my position, hot Nixon
This one, for all the sick ones, confliction
Posionous darts sickening, best believe
Finger itching with two broke legs, 
now I'm tripping
On MC's cliche
, 
shot that ricochets
Start trouble bust bubbles, hip to wicked ways
Gotta love me, G-O-D no one above me
Look good but fuck ugly
, tap your jaw
From my punch, watch your son and you
Got you shitting in your last Huggie, running who?
Fucking punk, get a speed bump coming through
A single shot make your knees knock, respect Wu
[Redman]
Aiyyo I put it on a nigga
, 
shit it on a nigga
Turnin Christian to a certified sinner
The bomb I release, time pent up (explodes)
While you got set up I was hittin your ex ho
Shit I kept low, petro' your metro
Politic, keep the chickenheads bobbing
Shit I'm driving in, come with funk halogen
Terrorize your city, from the spliff committee
Kick ass till both Timberlands turn shitty
Gritty, smack the driver's head in the chin see
When I approach rappers be taking notes
I drop like I should've invented the raincoat
Absolute, I love to burn to the roots
(Chorus)
[Notorious B.I.G.]
Today's agenda
Got the suitcase up in the 
Sentra
Go to room 112, 
tell em Blanco sent ya
Feel the strangest
If no money exchanges
I got these kids in ranges
Believe them niggas brainless
All they tote is 
stainless
You just remain as
Calm as possible, make the deal go thru
If not, here's 12 shots, we know how you do
Please make yo killings clean
Slugs up in between
They eyes
, like 
True Lies
Kill em and flee the scene
Just bring back the coke or the cream
Or else, yo life is on the shelf
We mean this 
Frank
Them cats we fucking wit put bombs in yo moms gas tank
Lets get this money baby
They shady, we get shady
Dress up like ladies
And burn em with dirty 380's
Then they come to kill our babies
[Raekwon]
We up in the lab, two Spanish, one Arab lady
Laying on the bed, looking like a drag
Had the pillow cuffed, looking at me and Frank, her grill was rough
Who would've ever think she'd rather do us up
But that's the business, back to the sitch
On these Puerto Rican kids with pistols
Doin sign language is twitching noses
Ask 'em where the money at, yo where the coke at papi?
We can do this all day, yo y'all both whack
They pulled out, one of my dunn soldiers was wombed out
They snuck up on him, put the tool up in his mouth
Walked them up in crib, big move, but they grabbed the kid
Had the shotty on my beehive, my wig
And yo they took me to the bathroom, started up the chainsaw yo
You gon' talk or see your brains on the floor
(Chorus)
[Ghostface Killah]
Bleed just like us, believe my pipe bust
If he holding the right amount of cheese I might rush the spot
Up early in the morning, kick the door in, wave the 4 an'
(fuck) the brawling, cause Tony for the stalling
And all I see is $ signs, here's the bottom line either
Give up the product or get shot up with a brolic 9
Invest figures to address (niggas)
Working out, all I curl is my index finger
Got a safe that hold more notes than Cortex singers
My work is move trays, serve 'em up like gourmet dinners
When it comes to cuttin that (coke), who got the best trimmers
Edward Scissorhands them grams,
 (niggas) respect winners
I got them big spenders coming through, hourly
Competition, we knock 'em out the box, powerfully
Still drop a ill verse, on the D.I., me
You might be gone, but the legacy is B.I.G., nigga
[Rakim]
Its mister word renowned with the best verse
One of the illest the streets, from the east to the west, heard
Get greeted with ghetto gestures like "yessir"
A pre-meditated killer for the way I stretch words
Some of us love to flow 'til the club close
And some in love with blow for the love of dough
In it for fortune and fame, flamboyant for girls
They extorting the game, exploiting the hood
Rappers ride for bread while the gossip spread
It's only hot cause we ride, spotted cops with feds
Plus, lots of heads go Pop instead
That's the word on the block is, "Hip-Hop Is Dead"
So consumers quit copping, rappers flip-flopping
Artist pimped by they labels like a slave pick cotton
Pop Charts killing underground Hip-Hopers
While the world still looking for Ra like Bin Laden, let's go
(Chorus)
[Busta Rhymes]
In God we trust
Yo its a must that you heard of us yo we murderous
A lot of niggas is wonderin and they curious
I'm making my niggas deal with it so mysterious
Furious all of my niggas is serious
Should niggas be walkin around fearing us
Frontin nigga like you don't wanna be hearing us
Gotta listen to the radio be playing us
30 time a day shit'll make you delirious
Damagin everything all up in your areas
Yo its funny how all the chickens be always serving us
All up in between they ass where they wanna carry us
Hitcha gonna hit em off with the illiest
Varias chickens they wanna marry us
Yo its Flipmode my nigga you know we bout to bust
Settle for your money the label preparing us
[Kool G Rap]
Suckers I clobber, because my town is full of cops and robbers
You're not promised tomorrow in this Little Shop of Horrors
So I got to get with the business of hit quick
Moneygrip's pocket's looking thick so I stick Slick
Hold it right here, hands in the air, I know you got the loot
Or better yet, face down on the ground, empty your pockets troop
Hit the deck I got the Tech right on your neck
And I expect to make a buck to heck with a traveller's check
But if a vic' tries to choke me
I'll have to smoke him like 
I'm Smokey the Bear
, so okie dokie
Goodbye, or bon voyage, have a good journey
Don't even try begging for your life, that don't concern me
So to the next weasel that freezes
Your begging and your pleases only getting your closer to meeting Jesus
Yeah, I shake a schmuck just to make a buck
Then I break a duck and if the duck gotta get bucked then I don't give a f**k
(Chorus)

[Kung-fu sample from "8 Diagram Pole Fighter"]
Today I'll talk about kindness
Justice, faith, and kindness
I want you to listen carefully
Kindness and faith, are the foundation
Without them, we can't become good people
And with justice, we know we can lead a good life
And how can I be a good man then, eh?
Huh... well, first of all, you have to practice honesty
Mmm?
Keep your temper, never lose control of yourself
Keep control
Be patient, if you learn to do these things, you can master anything
[Hook]
Out of nowhere, there came a caravan
This was around a campfire light
A lovely woman in motion
Her hair was as dark, as the night
[Method Man]
Cruisin on the interstate, just follow while I innovate
Too many try and imitate
, 
medallion like a dinner plate
Front and get your dinner ate
, 
chinchilla for the winter, wait
I'm tryin to bring the "Sexy Back" like Timbaland and Timberlake
Spittin like a calico, kush from a Cali ho
Tell that joker "tally ho", put shots in that Denali yo
RZA you know how we go on them 20's, that's how we roll
And I don't eat berries but 
eat a Berry like Halle though
The game criminal, my, my chain figaro
My, my dame's pigeon-toed, I'm still the same nigga though
Uh, kid rock a fitted low, still got a wicked flow
And I'm like Barry Bonds on anything that RZA throw
[Ghostface Killah]
On anything that RZA throw, Ironman's invisible
I left my chick for cheatin on me, now that bitch is miserable
Poppin bottles, paintin hella Wallo's on my physical
We gon' have a ball, might as well pick a testicle
Purple haze festivals, smoke a nigga like a bowl
Fuck a coma, now the state you layin is a vegetable
You wanna see me? Like you ain't checkable?
You like a CD, I burn you and I wrecked a few...
[Hook]
[Kung-fu sample - over Hook]
Only God, has lept into avenged mind
And can distinguish, good, from evil
Ha ha ha ha
[RZA] Aye Yo Cappa!!
[Cappadonna]
We gotta get more cake together, so we could branch out
Preserve land, get a boat and a ranch house
Call me a dreamer, but I hustle for real
You thought that I fell off but now I'm attackin the field
All in Chicago, grindin, puttin it down
Crush blocks of MC's, I ain't playin around
Yo you heard me on The Bassment, givin it to 'em
Fake dudes hidin theyself, but I could see through 'em
Diggler, what? I'm tryin to live and raise kids
While you throwin up ya sign,
 
I'm layin 'em down kid
Plus I'm back home now, doin my thing
Thirty dollars to 
Medina
 just to cop me a ring
[Hook]
[Kung-fu sample - over Hook]
A good friend, holds his drink
Bad company makes bad wine!
Drinking among friends
Red wine means a good life
A few drinks bring comfort
Two drinks are enough!
Money can't buy courage!
Riches mean nothing to us!
Brilliant, a display of genius

[Intro: Method Man]
The RZA, the GZA, Ol' Dirty Bastard, Inspectah Deck
Raekwon the Chef, U-God, Ghostface Killah, Masta Killa
And the Me --- yeah, yeah, come on, now, now
[Method Man]
What's happening? 
Who get it cracking like a neck snapping
For the rapping, 
and who them fellas packing yelling Staten
From the background, I'll back down a few
Try to clown us in the past, where they at now?
I'm ill as baby powder with the smackdown, for the record
My brain is like the project projected, for the Method
Go see my nigga Kush, he got the best shit for burning
This one go out for whom it may concerning
Spending they entire earning, trynna get a higher learning
MC's is vermin, like E be Sermon
Ya'll too determined, feeling yaself like Pee-Wee Herman
While we at it, let's tighten up our grips around that cabbage
Silly rabbits, how many kids'll trick you out your carrots
Ghetto bastards and ghetto bitches, I break you like a bad habit
My dick is two inches too big for it's britches
Uh, so fuck a mister and your misses
Cottonmouth niggas X'ed out like Merry Christmas, that all
Uh-huh, be home
*bell rings*
[Method Man]
Knock, knock, who is it, Tical I pop digit
My block too hot to visit, round here, you gots to live it
MC's, you must admit it, I'm deadly on this mic like
Anthrax on this premise,
 anyone of ya'll can get in
I breathe, 
Backwoods sleeves and THC
I bleed, 
kamikazes and forty OZ's
America's Most, 
the better the smoke, the better the quotes
For cheddar, Meth'll sever the throat, whatever the coast
I'm home, let the sun shine on, get his grind on
And get some phone time, everytime I'm in your timezone
Look here, it's crooked letter I, ya'll don't meet nothing but crooks here
It's hot in hell's kitchen, get your cookware, for goodness
MC's is like that shit chicks be gushing
For pushing, got me tooken down to Central Booking
I stick out, as if Tical just walked up in the party with my dick out
And I'm prepared to take the shit I dish out
"When you realize that what you got ain't what you want" - sample
[GZA]
On the, yo, on the expressway, suddenly, I, um, hit the breaks
A mistake, patrol figure just, ran the plates
I pull to the shoulder, a half mile ahead
The vibe got colder when the marksman said
"Yo, you in the truck, get the fuck out your car
Put your hands where my eyes could see, not far"
A fat slob, with pepperspray in the canister
Donut shop lounger, nine mil brandisher
Plus my half pound just rang the bell
Of the bloodhound, had an acute sense of smell
I guess he was tired of the strip and booking whores
Moving off a tip he's claimed he's looking for
Some MC's wanted for a string of break-ins
Last seen wearing long minks and snakeskins

[Intro - Gladys Knight]
Hey you know everybody's talking about the "good old days"
Everybody! The good old days
Well, let's talk about the good old days
[Raekwon the Chef]
Know what I'm saying?
Take you on this lyrical high real quick
1993 exoticness, know what I'm saying?
Let's get technical; where's your bone at?
Get up on that shit, a'ight? Yo!
[Verse 1]
Yo
Started off on the island, aka Shaolin
Niggas wilin', gun shots thrown, the phone dialin
Back in the days I'm 8 now, 
making a tape now
Rae gotta get a plate now
Ignorant and mad young, wanted to be the one
Till I got (Blaow! Blaow! Blaow!) felt one
Yeah, my pops was a fiend since 16
Shooting that "that's that shit!" in his blood stream
That's the life of a 
grimey, real-life crimey
And niggas know that habit's behind me
Day one, yo, growing all up in the ghetto
Now I'm a weed fiend jetting to Palmetto
In Medina, yo, no doubt
 
the God got crazy clout
Pushing the big joint from down South
So 
if you're filthy stacked up
Better watch your back and duck
Cause these fiends, they got it cracked up
Now 
my man from up north
, 
now he got the loft
It's solid as a rock and crazy salt
No jokes, I'm not playing, get his folks
Desert Eagle his dick and put em in a yoke
And to know for sure, I got reck and rip shop
I pointed a gat at his mother's knot
(Yo, Rae, don't do that shit, man! Don't do that shit! )
Fuck that!
[Hook]
[Raekwon] Dedicated to the winners and the losers
[Ghostface] 
Dedicated to all Jeeps and Land Cruisers
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Raekwon] Dedicated to the 
5's
, 
850i's
[Ghostface] Dedicated to niggas who do drive-bys
(Can it be that it was all so simple then?)
[Raekwon] Dedicated to the Lexus
 
and the Ac's
[Ghostface] Dedicated to MPV's
: phat!
[Verse 2 - Ghostface Killah]
Yo
Kicking the fly cliches
Doing duets with Rae and A, happens to make my day
Though I'm tired of busting off shots, having to rock knots
Running up in spots and making shit hot
I'd rather flip shows
 
instead of those
Hanging on my living room wall:
My first joint - and it went gold!
I want to lamp, I want to be in the shade
Plus the spotlight
, 
getting my dick rode all night
I want to have me a phat yacht
And enough land to go and plant my own sess crops
But for now it's just a big dream
Cause I find myself in the place where I'm last seen
My thoughts must be relaxed, be able to maintain
Cause times is changed and life is strange
The glorious days is gone, and everybody's doing bad
Yo, mad lives is up for grabs
Brothers passing away, I gotta make wakes
Receiving all types of calls from upstate
Yo, I can't cope with the pressure
Settling for lesser
The God left lessons on my dresser
So I can bloom and blossom, find a new way
To continue to make more hits with Rae and A
Sunshine plays a major part in the daytime
Peace to mankind

Ghostface carry a black nine

When we get, when we get, when we get a little props
And really really get the way we gotta go?
That's when you know it's on?

We gon' keep goin'

So that when our children, word
So that when our children, all our seeds and whatever
They got somethin' for theyselves right there
[Ghostface Killah]

You know what I'm sayin' (word)

[Verse 1: RZA]
Wait, hold up, chill, what's that, son?
Damn nigga got fucked, shit, huh?!

Seven the center of your eight point Sun
Hold tight grip on the God-U Now, you best be careful!
Can't dodge two Self-Hes aimed at your domepiece
Father-U-C-King police!!

Something in the slum went 
rum-pum-pum-pum
Something in the slum went rum-pum-pum-pum
[Verse 2: Masta Killa]
Yo, Rae it's been a long time son since we bust gun
Clap glaciers, ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you enter
We have an A.P.B. on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
[Hook: Cappadonna]
Yo something in the street went, BANG BANG
Making it hard for you to do your thang thang
Something in the street went BANG BANG..
[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Up in the boss game wilding, money for grabs
I ain't fucking with crabs, out of state copped two labs
Hopped two cabs, back on the Ave
Stab you with the vocab
, 
catch me at the big dough rehab
Tryna re-up, keep my feet up
Snake niggas in the cut, hold the product
Time is up, no luck, heat start to bust
Niggas you can't trust, dealing with lust
Seen him at the ballgames with James

[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
These are the bones, bones from the grave of Houdini
G-Deini
, 
Ronzoni
 noodles sprinkled on your embry'
Climb like the deficit
, profits, 
death threats
To Israel slid through Bethlehem
 bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the 60's
Granddaddy Caddy was copping 6 G's
B'gosh all that Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champelle, brown paper bags, wall to wall bumpers
[Verse 5: U-God]
These ain't the camera guys, cause, turn your eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
Newsflash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again
, ruff men scuff Timbs
Sonic bionic lens,
 
RZA console
Is it Bush or the Dole, front row of the Superbowl
Black gold in my soul, on a ho stroll
Don't go boy you on parole you don't know?
[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
[Verse 6: U-God]
Made 'em throw they hands up but then lay flat
Rat pack eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I show and prove
, trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the buggy-I Benz
Who contends, Wu like the Superfriends
Who's your rhyming hero?
 
Wu-Tang rules again
[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK
Money is stacked, now bust your gun, CLACK CLACK
Someone in the back went, CLACK CLACK

Shake them niggas
[Raekwon]
Scary hours no money out, smash the Guinness Stout
Play the outfield, Lucille, switched cracks on shields
She's a rich fiend sacrifice her fam
 shift them niggas
To Queens
Guess jeans she charged thirty-five beans
Hit the cell phone, regulate with
 
well known Tone
A Wally kingpin
 
who also slam the strike edition
What up? Corleone smoke the bone, Tone phone me
What up? He tried to slang there, address him with chrome only
Grady with the gray beard, transporting for him
Rocking Nike Air, Rastafarian bird, piping that
Switchin Benzes
, 
ten carat nigga with gold lenses
Fronting like he's sitting on a lump, he's sitting on junk
You wanna pull a heist, draw guns and robberies
You wanna rock rep, step in yellow Wallabies
Names arraigned, 
the Century Fox
, 
little Glocks
Them niggas with stocks, ______ blocks
Rich lifestyle, spoiled like an ordinary white child
But right now, Sun it still shine, shed light now
Breakdown, liquidate God, 
fucking grab the nickel plate
'Spenser: For Hire'
, tension when we mention Dryer
He's a slave cop, behave pop
But Suze with beige top
 will blow that cat at the Purple Haze spot
[Method Man]
I remember sticking fiends at the 
one-six-ooh
When we was starving, ducking five-oh, paying 'em dues
Times is hard in the slums I'm from, they got us barred in
We warring and cage dodging, ripping and robbing
Got the NARC sabotaging, slipping cracks in
Your camoflouging, now you snitching on the squadron
That's something niggas can't pardon
City overrun by young gun with bad intention and Wu-Wear garment
So I see no need to mention, the potency
Of a sting from a killa bee,
 
kicking the battery
Out the back of them wisecracks
Distorted for your get high, you hijack
These friendly skies ain't for you, they for me and mine
This the year of the grimy nigga, ragtime
Keep these niggas on the run, peep my Clan emblem
Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
[Hook: Method Man]
Catch us swimming with these sharks now, 
you rap villains
(I feel the same way you niggas feeling)
We feel the same way you feeling, let it be known (let it be known)
*together* 
What the blood clot
 you niggas dealing, you crash dummies
Cash rules,
 
still don't nothing move but the money
[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyyo strongarm that kid right there with wavy hair
Billy Johnson snatched him out his whip in Times Square
Took his 
Pumas
, nameplate, 
dude lost weight
Summer '88, started a fight, that can't wait
Ask Dorothy, same kid pussy up in Marcy
Blazing that Ted Rossi up in The Marquees
He lost like a hundred ounces, Jake rushed his houses
Had him on the porch, ass no trousers
This souped up, individual stuck, the new stuff
Same kid crying on the stand with Judge Cuffner
Kissed him with odd numbers three to nine style
Before he left he flashing his face like Denzel
Richard Dale took his Beaver, 
underwall balling his whip
Mussy dropped and 
split his wig with the heater
His shape-up was all fucked up
, 
as he had me laughing
God you see how he was laid out in the grass
With dirt in his mouth
, 
Slim woke him up told him he wild out
Blood leaking from his teeth he smiled like he gummed out
Big bolo, stacking his shit, financed a Volvo
He copped his shit from a small coffee shop in SoHo
He still pussy, he sell his dust up on the Lower East
Posing like he rapping out
...

[Kung Fu sample]
I must tell you that the Clan is a danger to the public
But still for many men just to hear of the name
Fills them with hate and loathing
But why? They've never harmed anyone
I'm afraid they did
*beat drops*
In the past there's something that they would like to forgive
First, I'll tell you about their style, planned techniques
The main style
"Shaolin Finger Jab!"
[RZA (Method Man)]
Yo..
*sounds of fighting*
(Uh-huh)
[Kung Fu Sample]
We are watchin your whole group
You been busy here
Around the clock, all we need is your orders to move
Met a lot of crosses last night
Young and old!
You been busy here
I respect that!

Yeah, (Eh yo), yeah
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in (Yo)

ain't nothin sweet
, 
get dumped off
Frontin like you won't get deaded and bumped off
Drastic son, master guns that'll run up in plastic ones
And then go, crash in the slums
One tight army, Few Good Men
 that'll rep
Invade your strongarm', Prince of Wales swimmin on feet
Props in sales, all yellow L's, cops sleepin on nails
Niggas get realer than real, yo
Flash the brown, last time was crowned
All navy Woolridge, 
Wu kicks, movin them pounds
, yo
Last on niggas, great adventures of my niggas
And cast out pictures, sendin a rash out the kitchens
Like the wind, invite the grin, watch niggas rewrite the trend
Wu niggas did it again, yo
Unhighly, octane, 
die cast metal frame
Lame, let another man heat handle beef
[Hook: Method Man]
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
[GZA]
Yo, spark the intro, relevant info
Load up the keyboard, 
105 tempo
Most heated battles, I've blasted MC's
Some said that the bullets flew by like angry bees
Wu entered on the level, then we would wait and listen
While one flashed metal, eight calculate position
The world snapped, once we combined our rap
Drastic measures, priceless treasures on Nap'
Our swords swing, windchill Mount Aerie
Native plant standin' on the tall-grass prairie
Snares and kicks, off the project bricks
It's no act the producer played the role with drumsticks
The warning came unnoticed, 
it's like the shot "On the Dock of the Bay"
That slayed Otis,
 the Nine-Lotus
Each one adjust to his own environment
Formulate this great LP, a hundred rounds spent
Niggas bent on a fruitless search for nourishment
They long for this proper guidance encouragement
[Hook 2X]
[Method Man]
It be The Lost Tribe, 7 Days locked in the dungeon
Foamin at the mouth, mad dog in this production
The Uncontrolled Substance got me spittin up nuff bars
, disgustin
The last temptation of the son of David Ruffin
Hold my mic sideways when bustin
On Judgement Day runnin thru Hell, yellin and cussin
At MC's in my circumfrance, y'all niggas hand-cuffin
These hoes and ain't read them they rights or nothin
Keep lustin, yea, and I'mma a keep hustlin
With Chamber Music fuckin the party up-in
You know me, 
everytime you kiss that ho you blow me
You blow trial trin to walk a mile in my 
Sauconys
[Hook 2X]
[Masta Killa]
(AHHHHH!!!!)
We just touched down, Wu shuttle, private jet
Stepped off the plane, the world wept
Roll with the 
Witty Unpredictable
Talent All Natural
, rock with the bangles of hip-hop
Mathematical imperial manifestation of greatness
Make wizes scream and shout at the top of their breath essence
Captured on tape is precious, bless mic pure defness
Awaken from you sleep mistake
When the God bring rain, hail, snow to the earthquake! *echoes*

Clan in the front, let your feet stomp
Niggas on the left, rag shit to death
Hoods on the right, wild for the night
Punks in the back, come on in the track to what
[Verse 1: GZA]
The Wu is coming through, the outcome is critical
Fucking with my style is sort of like a miracle
On 34th Street, in the Square of Herald
I gamed Ella, the bitch caught a Fitz like Gerald-
-ine Ferraro, who's full of sorrow cause the ho didn't win
But the sun will still come out tomorrow
And shine shine shine like gold mine
Here comes the drunk monk, with a quart of Ballantine
Pass the bone, kid pass the bone
Let's get on this mission like Indiana Jones, the GZA
One who just represent the Wu-Tang clique
With the game and soul of an old school flick
Like the Mack and Dolemite, who both did bids
Claudine went to Cooley High and had mad kids
So stop, the life you save may be your motherfucking own
I'll hang your ass with this microphone
Make way for the merge of traffic
Wu-Tang's coming through with full metal jackets
God squad that's mad hard to serve
Come fronting hard, then Bernhard Goetz what he deserves
[Hook]
[Verse 2: GZA]
No response while I bomb that ass
You ain't shit, your wack ass town had you gassed
Egos is something the Wu-Tang crush
Souped up niggas on a stage get rushed
I don't give a goddamn on the shows you did
How many rhymes you got or who knows you kid
Cause I don't know you therefore show me what you know
I come sharp as a blade and I cut you slow
You become so Pat as my style increases
What's that in your pants ahh human feces
Throw your shitty drawers in the hamper
Next time come strapped with a fucking Pamper
How you sound B? You're better off a quitter
I'm on the mound, G, and it's a no-hitter
And my DJ the catcher, he's my man
In a way he's the one who devised the plan
He throws the signs I hook up the beats with clout
I throw the rhymes to the mic and I strike em out
So it really doesn't matter on how you intrigue
You can't fuck with those in the major leagues
[Hook]

Call it the Hollow Bone syndrome line
Select sweet nine, face this, watch his whole face lift
Bracelets, murder niggas, luxurious, banks I was draped
Caked out, half a million dollars in coats
Flows is genetic, the Corleone connection in all
Selection, stock brokers with coats on
Make coke suggestion, all twin glizzies
Fireman, Gucci boots on, sideways action, murder niggas fear me yo
Cash that he did Clinton, rentin his mother crib out
We send organize the Bill of Rights get lid
Drugs that Hendrix was on
, conversatin like the Dutch

Pissin down ya elevators shaft, no class, writin graf' on ya walls
It be us, fuck ya law, niggas my cause is "because"
No yin to my yang, it's a black thing
Used to be in chains, now we snatch chains
Took the crack game applied it to the rap game, y'all
Pop quiz, now, what artist hits the hardest?
Ya down with the syndrome: retarded
I think it was them swordsmen
Place them chess pieces on the boards and
Take it to square, this ain't no Yakool affair
Or a New World Disorder, got us, fuckin the coal miner's daughter
That y'all, but not us

[Outro: kung fu sample]
During this time, I intend to teach you the Shaolin poem
The rules and commandments, that void, deceit
Cruelty and unkindness, always help the weak
Never despise the poor, always respect yourself

[Inspectah Deck:] Yo butter butter
[Method Man:] Protect Ya Neck baby
[GZA:] Respect due pa
[Inspectah Deck:] Peace
[GZA:] Peace
[Inspectah Deck:] Word up Wu-Tang in the house though
I guess alot of people in ya
I guess they can feel the realness you
They could feel the vibe
And I think hip hop, that's what I be tellin a lot of people
Alot of record promoters and alot of artists
I mean it's like, it's music that you gotta touch and feel
You know what I'm sayin'
And I think that comes across well in the video
I haven't seen you live yet, I'm waitin for the chance
But I'm pretty sure that's probaly what's it like
You know you probaly really get into it
I guess I hear it in your voices when you sayin the rhymes
Um, what ya say ya style is?
[Kung Fu sample:]
It's a secret! Never teach the Wu-Tang
[Sounds of fighting]

Bad gas, Macintosh, the light is red

Pump 'em and defeat 'em, dump 'em, and delete 'em
This negro right here pimps hoes
I smoke so much dope
 I have ya bloody at the nose
Since my buddy at these hoes wit a bud like a rose
It just so happens I'm the nigga that she chose
I flows above the rest, mos' def'

Whatever you do, you keepin it true
Big Dogg and ODB, I thought you knew
Oooh, the Wu, is back up in this motherfucker
Oooh, and Snoop, is burnin rubber on these suckers

To the beat y'all, you can't sleep y'all
On my flow y'all niggas don't know y'all
You see my style calm but wild
You witness the rhyme, nothin but dimes
The eightball murder verse, freestyle or rehearsed
I wreck emcees whether I'm last or first
What, what, what, what,
 
hazardous dart
Visual long forgotten art
That fell apart,
 
til the blood ran from the heart
Pump through the street, Rza make re-break beats
Packed seats, rapid fire raps at off track meets
And an arm tank, high rank, heavy metal shank
Blow 'em off the plank when they ships approach the bank
Wu niggas rollin,
 
throwin the first rap slogan
Heroes of Hogan,
 
shot up the military clothin'
Quickly blow up,
 
rolled up in rappers like pennies
My brother stack tracks on the behalf of many
With the wisdom, power of, science from experts
Self applyin,
 
that put giants in the network
The compact disc and televised live cults
Will multiply our strength, on a worldwide note
Yes, what, what

Yes, yes y'all, you don't stop
You keep on, til the break o dawn
Ah yes, yes y'all, you don't stop

Cash rules everything around me
Take you on a natural joint
C.R.E.A.M.

Here we here we go
Dolla dolla bill y'all
Check this shit
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
I grew up on the crime side, the New York Times side
Staying alive was no jive
Had secondhands, Mom's bounced on old man
So then we moved to Shaolin land
A young youth rocking the gold tooth,
 
'Lo goose
Only way I begin to G off was drug loot
And let's start it like this son, rolling with this one and that one
Pulling out Gats for fun
But it was just a dream for the teen who was a fiend
Started smoking woolies at 16
And running up in gates, and doing hits for high stakes
Making my way on fire escapes
No question I would speed for cracks and weed
The combination made my eyes bleed
No question I would flow off and try to get the dough all
Sticking up white boys in ball courts
My life got no better, same damn 'Lo sweater
Times is rough and tough like leather
Figured out I went the wrong route
So I got with a sick-ass clique and went all out
Catching keys from across seas
Rolling in MPV's
 
every week we made forty G's
Yo nigga respect mine or here go the TEC-9
Ch-chick-POW,
 
move from the gate now
[Hook: Method Man]
Cash rules everything around me:
CREAM, get the money
Dollar, dollar bill y'all
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
It's been twenty-two long hard years of still struggling
Survival got me bugging, but I'm alive on arrival
I peep at the shape of the streets
And stay awake to the ways of the world cause shit is deep
A man with a dream with plans to make cream
Which failed; I went to jail at the age of fifteen
A young buck selling drugs and such who never had much
Trying to get a clutch at what I could not touch
The court played me short, now I face incarceration
Pacin' - going upstate's my destination
Handcuffed in the back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
But as the world turns I learned life is hell
Living in the world no different from a cell
Every day I escape from Jakes giving chase,
 
selling base
Smoking bones in the staircase
Though I don't know why I chose to smoke sess
I guess that's the time when I'm not depressed
But I'm still depressed and I ask what's it worth?
Ready to give up so I seek the old Earth
Who explained working hard may help you maintain
To learn to overcome the heartaches and pain
We got stickup kids, corrupt cops, and crack rocks
 and
Stray shots
, 
all on the block that stays hot
Leave it up to me while I be living proof
To kick the truth to the young Black youth
But shorty's running wild, smoking sess, drinking beer
And ain't trying to hear what I'm kicking in his ear
Neglected for now, but yo, it gots to be accepted
That what? That life is hectic
[Outro: Raekwon]
Niggas got to do what they got to do
To get through - know what I'm saying?
Because you can't just get by no more - word up -
You gotta get over - straight up and down
[Hook: Method Man]

[Intro: Kung-Fu Sample]
You've practiced 20 years? You must be extremely good then
Perhaps, you'll try with me
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Come and taste my seasonin', Chef, the cooking that is marvelous
Back over a stove, makin' your mouth water, you starve for this
Exclusive sneakers with hard denim, heavyweight
A neighbor illustrated 
Alex Haley
 with paper
Waves spinnin' like the Titanic, come take a float on
Silky like King Henry VIII’s robe in late spring
Restaurants with skeleton keys, it's big business
Well groomed and elegant posture is real dapper
Status is gigantic, culture's alpaca
Meetings in the Vatican, drinkin' scotch with the Muscle Milk
Praises go to Ason, the dynasty Mr. Russell built
Feed me royal shottas with Glocks, clean 'em with GT Oil
China dolls from Bangkok, we bang 'em, train 'em and make 'em loyal
Trees stank, she come kiss the top of my Yves Saint
Wise-Universal Tang when I bang
Grizzly with the big bank, it's 5 stars, y'all, when I call rank
[Hook] x2
Egos are somethin' that the Wu-Tang crush
These stupid jealous niggas, y'all 'bout to get rust
This ashes to ashes to dust to dust
These derelict MC's cannot fuck with us, Lord
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Rifles out, bear like the Russian
Octagon tuggin' silk drawers frontin', while her head stuntin'
[?] flood the garage
Man the goats launchin' charge cards from Africa
Catch me in the hookah lodge
Brains linked, twisted Cohibas, say the seeds bang
Coffee pots with graveyard rings, flippin' Gs
Yankee hoodlum on the top of the charts
Dart throwers, they're sharks
Everybody wanna know when my gun barks
[Bridge: RZA]
Non-athletic anti-semetic synthetic rappers get no credit
Pathetic septic lines, incompetent styles not embedded
Wu-Tang slang bangs in your brain, this is not genetic, prophetic
Unadulterated talent while y'all talk that bullshit rhetoric
[Hook]

[Intro - Wu-Tang movie dialogue]
A game of chess is like a swordfight;
You must think first before you move
Toad style is immensely strong and immune to nearly any weapon;
When it's properly used it's almost invincible
[Verse 1: U-God]
Raw I'mma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
Like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
You might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushing force, my force you're doubting
I'm making devils cower to the Caucus Mountains
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Well I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary, and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
Is coming through with nuff niggas, and nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweating, stressing contesting
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggas are
 
outlined in chalk
I'm mad vexed, it's what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
Steamrolling niggas like a eighteen wheeler
With a drunk driver driving, there's no surviving
[Verse 3: Raekwon the Chef]
Rough like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan in 'Yota Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggas with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We pack chrome Tecs, nickel plated Macs
Black Ac's,
 
drug dealing styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
Cuz I got to get my props, and win it yo
I got beef wit commercial-ass niggas with gold teeth
Lamping in a Lexus eating beef
Straight up and down don't even bother
I got forty niggas up in here now, who kill niggas fathers
[Hook: Method Man]
My peoples are you with me where you at?
In the front, in the back
 
killa-bees
 on attack
My peoples are you with me where you at?
Smoking meth hitting cats on the block with the gats
[Verse 4: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Here I go, deep type flow
Jacques Cousteau could never get this low
I'm cherry bombing shits... BOOM
Just warming up a little bit,
 
vroom vroom
Rappining is what's happening
Keep the pockets stacked and then, hands clap
 and then
At the party when I move my body
Gotta get up and be somebody!
Grab the microphone put strength to the bone
DUH DUH DUH...enter the Wu-Tang zone
Sure enough when I rock that stuff
Huff? Puff? I'm gonna catch your bluff tuff
Rough, kicking rhymes like Jim Kelly
Or Alex Haley I'm a Mi-..Beetle Bailey rhymes
Coming raw style, hardcore
Niggas be coming to the hip-hop store
Coming to buy grocery from me
Trying to be a hip-hop MC
The law, in order to enter the Wu-Tang
You must bring the Ol' Dirty Bastard type slang
Represent the GZA, Abbot, RZA, Shaquan, Inspectah Deck
Dirty Ol' getting low wit his flow
Introducing, the Ghost..face.. Killah!!
No one could get iller
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Speaking of the devil psych, no it's the God, get the shit right
Mega trife
, 
and yo I killed you in a past life
On the mic while you was kicking that fast shit
You reneged tried again, and got blasted
Half mastered ass style mad ruff task
When I struck I had on Timbs and a black mask
Remember that shit? I know you don't remember jack
That night yo I was hitting like a spiked bat
And then you thought I was bugged out, and crazy
Strapped for nonsense, after me became lazy
Yo, nobody budge while I shot slugs
Never shot thugs,
 
I'm running with thugs that flood mugs
So grab your 8 plus 1, start flipping and tripping
Niggas is jetting I'm licking off son
[All]
Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang Wu Tang!
[Verse 6: Masta Killa]
Homicide's illegal and death is the penalty
What justifies the homicide, when he dies
In his own iniquity
 it's the
Master of the Mantis Rapture coming at ya
We have an APB on an MC Killer
Looks like the work of a master
Evidence indicates that his stature
Merciless like a terrorist hard to capture
The flow, changes like a chameleon
Plays like a friend, and stabs you like a dagger
This technique attacks the immune system
Disguised like a lie paralyzing the victim
You scream, as it enters your bloodstream
Erupts your brain from the pain these thoughts contain
Moving on a nigga with the speed of a centipede
And injure any motherfucking contender!
[Hook]

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
The nigga had a pair of Air Olden Polynice's on
Oh shit, the nigga had a pair of Air Christen Slaters
Rebel I, slay the max, it's really Digital

Rockin' the latest in Ben Stillaways
Fuck that, the next big thing, lay this as Hollywood niggas
Now that's a money thing
Yo yo
[Hook: Inspectah Deck *singing*]
I was +Dashing+ through the hood
Eighteens with the whip, smoke gray
Leavin' skid marks on five-oh, smokin' all the way
Hahaha!
With my all-star team, bitches see our shine
Yo son we gotta make that +CREAM+ whether raps or 
Nixon times
[Inspectah Deck]
They call me Rollie
, 
watch me polly with the wide body Dinali
Packed the bad hottie, rocked enough ice to play hockey
I swarm like paparazzi
, 
she popped a wheelie on the candy apple Kawasaki
Everything is sloppy, philosophical for those who copy
I'll probably splash her tonight, don't block me
Sippin' on Lime Bacardi got me
 
toxy
Plus the Cali 'dro holdin' me, I'm 'bout to 'scape
 
like the Roxy
Ever property, Monopoly,
 
big shotti
Snatch the +CREAM+, whether in the concert hall or in the lobby
Used to be a hobby, got me duckin' Rudy Giulianni
Like I'm still coppin' big eights from papi
Follow me, whether Mardi Gras' or house party
It's wild like safari, ain't mean to catch the body
But had 'em wobbly off the first blow, tryin' to knock me
I'm known to pump ya blood like the theme song to Rocky
Kamikaze, might karate chop ya head like a natty dread
Then call myself Collar Ratsi
Professionally trained, I 
aim
 for your artery
I give the autographs but charge for photography
Not hardly kid, 
you awkward Godbody
You'se a carbon copy, just started to rock Wallys
Spark the brocolli
, spaz off this ghetto opery
Or catch the hot seat, you're bawty boy without ya posse
Seen..
[Hook x4: Inspectah Deck]
Come, come, come
One for the dough, son
Give me the reasons
[GZA]
They couldn't get me, watch me move swiftly
Broke the unmarked fifty with this cabby who was a gypsy
He stayed tipsy, said he loved his bills crispy
Drivin' the streets he kept heat on the night, shifty
Quickly, who ring bells like it's twelve on Sunday?
While the stage catch shells from forceful gunplay
Mere fact that the track was a fierce counterattack
All those who couldn't multiply were sent back
No tanks, low rank, soldiers hittin' the heart
Tainted the heart of an empire, was torn apart
Brought to a halt from a front full assault
The chemist left the lab with undetermined results
They saw the swordsman sift electrical volts
The audience threw nuts with loose screws and bolts
The archives automatically changed ya stiff vibes
It was layin' in the zip drive from chest five
[Hook x4]
['Holy Robe of Shaolin Temple' sample]
Your faith in Shaolin is courageous
You blind fool we have our teachings to share
Our joy with the people
And there too suffer for them as well
You have learned your style well
Wu-Tang Style

Don't forget
 about the 
Masta

[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Motherfuckers halt when my Colt start stomping
Thunder strikes your land with the jolt
Your stamina level is low like currents from
The volts of relentless punishment that multiplies
At a speed that the naked eye can't detect
The infantry, peep the weapontry as 
I bomb atomically
Stagnant they stood surrounded and astounded
By this total square mileage of violence that I brung
I've not yet begun to stung
, it's the ethics
And rigorous training methods of the
 
Abbott
Incite oversees the opposition
Penetrates then infiltrates, breaking down your resistance
Leaving competition defenceless
Masta, Hip-hop 
antagonizer
Dumb, deaf and blind civilizer
 
with the silencer

Anger rap book causing chess blade smoke
Monster truck, punk, elephant gun poke
Jawbreaker humanoid vice grip, choke
Face the inferno, maestro pull it
Pipe hard slang

Never, sold my soul Golden Arm cold stinger
See me on the streets address me stone bringer
Ease away, freeze back, feedback, play out in sweet
Action packed rap, bite it, stomp on the beat
Possess hollow head battle teeth 
Tony Atlas
Wu status now wisdom to the masses
[Verse 3: RZA]
Cock back my tongue like a hammer
My head is like a nickel-plated bammer, spit .45 caliber grammar
At the speed of wind 
makes you bleed within
Crack your skull without penetrating your skin
Reign of champ official, Wu stamp with black pistols
Spent the weekend programming fat tracks at Camp Crystal
[Verse 4: Method Man]
Home on the range, 
rebel with a pen
Writing critically acclaimed scriptures that do you in
Mr. Mef, Hot Nickels
Say my shit holding my Sex Pistol, deal me in

One mind and one common cause, that's the shit Son
Play them crows out position

Red marker still bleeding through the paper
Of his sick premeditated murder caper

Watch Street eat 'em up, Cold Crush bum rush
Spot rusher get touched, bagged up, handcuffed
Y'all niggas can't fuck with us
[Verse 9: Ghostface Killah]
Pass me the Black Velvet

Spell it, Maxi Priest caught me in a daze up on Delancey Street
Stand solar, deadly vengeance with a crowbar
It's like the dreads worshipping Jah

Pineapple crush, 
850 swerve it with a rush
Plush the Canola Range spitting off the roof, holding my change
Yo it's ragtime, 
universal 12 Monkey mind
It's like stalking through your airport with a chunky .9
[Verse 10: StreetLife]
The underboss Staten New York
Bloodsport gun talk holding fort back, take 'em to court
It's the burner Shaolin bound face down you gets murdered
Roadblock shell shocked, stretched on a back block
Yo it's warfare when you ring here, slugs fly through mid-air
Landing thugs in wheelchairs from the slugfest
Keeps the iron, where the head rest
 for the conquest subway
Wordplay ricochet through your projects, crime pays
Matched up in a staircase in a dark place embraced
By the trey-eight, I'm in so deep I can't escape
These crime situations, I stay in man formation
A shot echoes through the ghetto locations y'all remain
P.L.O., 
slam cats like Bam Bam Bigelow
Throw a flow like Nomo, relate like Fidel Castro
I be the great all pro, hanging MCs by they logos
My street journal reacts and blaze like an inferno

Insecure about my ding-dong, married to Babylon
My queen lookin at me like a pawn!

Hot Nickel, who broke bread, at the Vatican
Stick a pin, in a citizen, mental food, got us diggin in

Killer bee keep your mind at ease, lay back like Adam fuckin Eve

The answer came clever, when we do greatness through trial and error
Mile of terror motor mouth, let the odour out
Fuming greater, the temper in my spine huminator

Ladies and gentlemen introducing Cab Calloway
Featuring the Dirt Dog
First things first man you're fuckin with the worst
I'll be stickin pins in your head like a fuckin nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
The heat is on, I'm about to blow up the spot
All I wanna see is fire cause I'm makin shit hot
Like the blow between Glocks, mad niggas I shot
Give a fuck on a cop, conversate with a lock
Down at the chop-chop, 600th and Rock
Crazy as a fox tryin to rob Fort Knox
The DeNiro-Al Pachino war
Tryin to score mad dough like a million or more
For the illegal war that's all I saw
It's all about that knot in ya
I'm alone, I roll with 6 niggas with stones
Every hour tap my phone with embezzlement stones
Get a loan from the stocks because of my pops
Fifty bills in the pocks, Wu-Gambino got props
[Cab Calloway]

Elevator scheme with the scheme to catch CREAM
Some diamond rings, jewels all types of priceless things
Just in case you don't make it to the safe
Don't talk to Jakes or your whole shit be laced
Got a bomb bout ready to blow up shit
The White House nuh be quiet as a mouse
My job is hundred proof, better know the scoop
Got niggas undergrounds, in your walls, in your roofs
About made zoo, 6-6-6-6-2
Cause I'm goin all out with the supplies of Balu
I'm unstoppable, my six man team is unstoppable
Stickin my middle fuckin finger at you
Livin in America's fuckin fucked up
When I was young some say I had no sense
I rhymed all day until my throat got tense
And bought em by the cage from my lungs to my knees
In the winter I cough, all summer I sneeze
Ah-choo! Then I was sore, there was only one cure
Original rhymes wholesome in thought
Democratics are debatin wanna be the imitatin
But the knowledge that I'm givin positively stimulatin
I acknowledge any MC in a South Bronx town
South Proof Projects, did they really go down
Shit, I remember when I was 12 years old
I didn't know about frontin or playin a role
I thought I was slick, I fell harder than bricks
With my best lyrics and my uptown ticks
Prince start jackin in my baseball cap
I'm tellin many chit-chats step off my jockstrap
Approach this party other known as a jam
Lookin for my cousin Bam-Bam Sleepingham
]From front to back the jam was packed
Over there some dance, over there I just macked
I looked around then I started to walk
Heard an older woman's voice and a silly slang talk
The kid was nice for payin the price
And give weak MCs beneficial advice
Yes, beneficial meaning good for more
Frontin cause with the mamas would have loved to explore
Studied MC and changed lyrics around
Before I became a member of the lost and sound
My words I strung, I bettered my voice
Rollin over people known to be top choice
Ch-ch - BLAOW BLAOW BLAOW

Tossed salad, oh you in some shit now
Callin' me a dog, well leave a dog alone
Cause nothin' can stop me from buryin' my bones

This is DJ Kay Slay, from around the way
And I'll smack the shit outta ANY OF YOU DJ's
That front on this shit.. think I'm playin?
(Hook: Method Man)
I heard you ladies got them Thang Thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?
I heard you ladies got them Thang Thangs, do you really?
I heard y'all niggas like to bang bang, do you really?
[StreetLife]
I never been a fan of the fame, I got love for the game
Never lust for the dames, I got dust in my veins
Little off in the brain, kid talks butter slang
Sniffed a little blow with the rap Eddie Kane
Spent a lot of dough, it's so hard to explain
And I fucked a lot of hoes off the strength of the name
Wu-Tang, see me at the next, X Winter Games
Snowboardin down a ski range
, it's a blue and grey frame
Keep, pointin the finger, I'm that nigga to blame
The main reason why you tuck the chain
Self proclaimed, got a lotta profit to gain
And I'm leavin the rap game the same way I came
[Method Man]
Now creep with me, as I roll through the Stat
Little Meth got my back, so do Pinky Fat-Fat
Let me hit that {*inhale*} contact, learn how to act
Before you bring that drama the end; now fade to black
Positive, hate kids who tell me lies
Despise guys that wanna get high but never buy
Got nine lives, nine wives that don't listen
Bitchin their biological clocks is tickin
Wu limited edition - hot off the presses
I guess it's, curtains for competition
Method, runnin 'em out, gun in my mouth
The kid your momma warned you about, tear down the house
After midnight, eatin MC's, change to a gremlin
You're tremblin, behind the Kremlin wall, surrenderin
That's what you get for Russian/rushin, in the direction I was bustin
Polish your sword, your shit is rustin
[Hook]
[Masta Killa]
One-two
Testin, testin, mic check wreckin
Steps
 into the session
Automatic weapon off safety, don't play me
But brings all them things with silencers
My clan is liver than your average '85er
Strive to stay alive
I play for keeps in the streets
Cause it's real on the battlefield
Shells hit the ground from the steel
Bullets travel, sun set fire to your mind
Words combine when I rhyme to feed the blind
Prepare my queen for battle and walk down
I drink from the wine of violence, no tolerance
Gave word bond, sword silence
Me in military fatigues, bulletproof underneath
Buy enough ammunition to round and sweep the streets
Of Brooklyn, central, sugar-whipped the rental
While I'm lickin out the window at y'all, fuck y'all
[Hook]
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, we thrive on street life, we strive to eat right
They blind and need sight
, we tried to be nice
They talk the small talk, we walk the long walk
We lost, they all thought, they forced to fall short
We rock for hard rocks, rocked the hot blocks
Shop and cop rocks, watch the top notch in action
Begin to make your head spin
Wu-Tang my brethren, we bang like veterans
They paid for record spins, taste the medicine
Or face the double M, we came to trouble them
Hustle them for they 20 mill' then buckle them
'Nuff to spin out the blue, bitches lovin them
Dozen men with force of a hundred-ten
Stumblin thug passions, it must've been
[Hook] - 2X

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
My team be bellyaching hungry niggas on the swarm again
Piranha nig bite dick
, yo son, it's on again
What up? He made a move, try to assist it
Listen kid yo, 
you was born to be a pawn but I'm a bishop
Back to the novel, yo Son, it's logical
How you figure God? What? Flow on the track, flip the obstacle
Now my proposal rips the global
From California to courts, it's over God told taste the soul food
Remember baggy jeans, the Timberlands in November
Shorty called me Santa in December
But guess what, 
my Wally's got messed up
Autograph pressed up what, blessed enough to blow your rest up
We scrape that, Land O' Lake that, Mazola rap
Will get you sent back
, represent the gentlemens who bent that
Flash medallions like Italians,
 
la costra nostra
We moving through your hood like we supposed to
Flexing Lex and Diamonds hold the settlement
To keep the bust your gun boo 
like that bad ass bitch in Dead Presidents
Add on the billboard store, check it now you get the gold dick award
It's like jail and it's the sixth floor
Test me, 
floating in the S.E.
, now let's see
Half of y'all niggas built your vine from my stress tree
Faggots, homos, yo,
 
my flavor liver than adobo
Stay militant kid, twist ya like bolo
You fucking idiot, playing with my Clan but you be fearing it
Fake one, I'm guaranteed to make you take one
Please, y'all niggas money's getting low
But could you come back though, set up shop and get the fat glow?
Tired of y'all, mostly inspired by y'all
So what the deal now, link up with us or put your shield down
Faggot (bitch), you fuck around punk (seven fifteen)
We battle for cream nigga
[Verse 2: RZA]
You want a pound crab? Nah let his hand swing
I ought to punch a hole in his palm with these pointy ass rings
No more said, knew your chump ass was dead
When I saw the .44 reflecting off your shiny forehead
It's Wu-Tang nigga, ain't nothing changed nigga
Still 'Shame on a Nigga', who tried to run game
Your version of perversion, fucking bitches on Persian rugs
Washing niggas like detergent, it's the surgeon
Slugs propels from Bobby Steele's 12 gauge
 
front page "Daily Chronicle" reads
"Hell up in Gotham, take heed and protect your seeds"
You fall like autumn leaves
, 
you lack tranquillity
In your rap utilities to fuck with the abilities
Race like a sperm cell to the ovary
Microphone post tone like a rotary phone, ancient poems of poetry Old scrolls, explosive head bullets, black hooded, 
Timberland footed ninjas
With 'Full Metal Jacket' clips and know how to put it in you
Surrender your goods and your merchandise for no purchase price
, 
I'm certainly a heist for your ice and curtains and vice
Come quietly, Wu-Tang Clan rules society
Because of variety, 
so maintain your high anxiety
And lead them to defy me, diary, ya Irie? ...
I need 18 points for my next joint, this high anointed king
To make a deal, I be the one to appoint
Steve Rifkind must have been sniffing
To catch something so dope,
 it left Monica Lynch pussy dripping
I fuck hundreds of bitches and split millions of dollars
And built with thousands of scholars
My life saga from the hill to the harbor, legal kid brown in Nicaragua
Gave birth to MCs, thieves and bank robbers
We drove expensive whips and took worldwide trips
And my dick's been sucked by the finest lips
Fancy delicatessens and the world's best refreshment
But none of the above compare to the one-twenty lessons
Or my queen and my seeds in the home that I rest in
Enter my zone get blown in 99 sections
[Verse 3: Method Man]
This rhyme has no limitation,
 this time there's no hesitation
Collecting minds at the door
You want it niggas it's yours, the flavors raw
What the fuck you think I'm flowing for? 
It's rhyme and reason
Bite the bullet, 
niggas is fowl and it's duck season
We at odds till we even motherfucker
Bad asses, high times, lower classes
Taste mine, straight shots in dirty glasses
Bring it to him, room service, under pressure
And mad nervy, waving guns at the clergy
Ticallion, we ain't worried, 
keep them sick niggas 7-30
Picture this, watch the birdy
These Bastards is Ol' and Dirty
, 
with sharp hymns
That be stabbing you
, pins and needles, needles and pins
'Nough said, dick in your mouth like Tempest Bled'
As I race track with thoroughbreds, ducking the Feds
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
Yo, my ice look fly upon the keyboard son
Niggas ran up on me lord, praising what we do by the laws
That's right, exile the fake, hit them niggas like weight
Feed 'em food, let the fake evaporate
Reconstruction, that's the whole science on my, production
Y'all niggas guess who stuck son, left his nuts hung
Switch, finger itch, staring at you like a bitch
Maybe y'all niggas snitched
You's a loner, Adidas shell top
 
while I
Sip a Corona, read the Robb Report, then bone her
Buy you some jewels, here's some food
Not necessarily mean to be rude boo, check out the analoo
We in the mushrooms, chased the high neck in the custom
Baggy jeans, thick ropes god, sliding through customs
Chill, y'all niggas know what time it is
James Bond beamers behind me on Bacardi Limon
Check out the pitch like Nolan Ryan, 
he caught a slug for lying
Yeah you was lying, where's the cash, crying
Militia, rolling in position
Casa Blanca Cuban Link Christian
Lex retali' back whistling fake fucks {*echoes*}

[Hook: Madame D]
Woke up this morning, smoked some sticky green to get me started

Two On Da Road on this (12 O'Clock)
I love my brother to death
(That old hip-hop, catch this)
(Hot Nix', you know? Big tits)
[12 O'Clock]
I love my brother to death, nigga pussy to the rest
Shared a pair of Guess and an Eddie Bauer vest
A bitch named 
Celeste
I met her when I was goin to cash a Def Jam check
She had some big ass breasts
I had to catch her like a shortstop on the Mets
A nigga high off a dime from Gates and Best
Remember grandmother live on Louis and Lex
I remember 
Dirt Dog
 
crashed his white Lex
I remember me and Meth won a dice game against Ghost and Deck
Remember Portland had Clyde Drex'
Remember 12 O'Clock is a vet
Big Dogs we put 'em to sleep, keep 'em on a leash
I move like days in a week
Niggas don't know the face and names on my teeth
Niggas carry a cold piece, and separate the heat
Ain't scared of the motherfuckin police
[RZA]
Yo, yo
Guns jammed up, I'm cramed up in my lab
Six niggas, six bitches, two fifths and eight bags
One toilet, three weedheads, an alcoholic
And two niggas hooked on pussy
And in the corner, was this brother who would study his lessons
And learned how operate the Smith and the Wesson
Still cut class and played hookey
Threw freshmens in garbage cans, gave 'em nookies
Rolled the, back of the bus with a gun in his socks
Big forehead, 
had ears like Spock
He was mightier than a truckload of gats
And bound to make a bitch cum in six minutes flat
[Raekwon]
What up kid? Stay livin
Seen you look good, you look live in ya linen
And you survived ninth innin
The hood got us off the prop without women
All my niggas that ride that provide to the end of this
[Madame D]
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Ain't nothin but the real
Ain't nothin but the real, yeah
Million dollar deals, rollin on Chrome Wheels
[Prodical]
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah (Ain't nothin but the real)
This one's on P. Sunn, word up? Yeah, uh-huh
We gamble the dice
, remain humble, scramble through the jungle of life
While the we rumble with the foul and trife
Shots fired on the block 
in threes like Glen Rice
Made men think twice about the sacrifice
Black on white, write it for the world to hear
Write it for my fam who not here who do care
Glance and stare, why when you can't compare?
From the bottom of my feet to the end of my hair
Move rear, cop the blue steel bare, groove to the snare
Bass and drums, see my face in the slums
Pedia Brown
, media surround my sound
When you see me in the hood of ya town, respect my sound
Sample with black, criminal, mechanical rap
Assemblin hat, laced in a suit from Phat
Two On Da Road, got them bitches screamin, "Who Dat?"
Two with the plaques, two with the gats, it's like that
[Hook]
[Madame D]
Two On Da Road, Bobby Digital

Weed blazin, cocoa hazin, cocoa hazin

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, high potency Thai,
 smoke a bag of black
And feel the vibe, born to be wise, we form on a rise
The corner mean five, horns in disguise, throw on your slides
Young niggas racist, 
smokers is basing
We seen the eyes laying up, playing the cut, what?
Stay in the truck, something told me duck, folded me up
My shoulders struck out of luck, fucked the Pradas up
Fell in a daze like a Golotta snuff, 
niggas tried to body me up
I'm in the lobby bleeding, niggas in the waiting office probably eating
And sprinting and beefing when they heard the shots called the precinct
And seen barber nieces beast, some niggas shot Shallah features
And shot through his Ellesses, bent the spinal cordless creatures
I'm gagging and flagging a cab down
Guess who in the Benz wagon, dragging my sound down macking
It was Dale Breedy the greedy, conniving-ass snake genie
Cop with a bikini who murdered charge and benini
I'm feeling wheezy and I'm drained from the cheeba grieving
Ain't even looking decent, seeing police niggas reaching
[Sample]
That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my...
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling
 
who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego path and broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source
[Sample]
That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing – Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we... fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up big up me and the boys
I thought for a second then chose rather than froze
Had the 
Gem Star
 in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing-boggle-de-dum
[Sample]
That splash against my hollow bones
[Sample: Unknown movie atm]
The sword, it's the best weapon of all
Two sharp edges, and a long spine
The blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
You remember that: the vital thing is the point
Pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it

[Raekwon]
Hang glide for my nigga
 
Tical
Yo, word to God we run this whole shit Son (no doubt)
Right that's my word, 
guaranteed you're dealin with the invicible
 (no doubt)
(I'm specialized in swordsmanship)
That's my word, 
Persian Legacy
 one time, one time
That's the science of the black man
Stationary niggas, have fun on this right here
Yo Shorty cross your arms
Gonna rock niggas to sleep this year (throw your leather up)
Blade thrower, sword swinga, 
killa bee
 ringer
Rocky road roll dark greener
Cream fademas

Shout out Medina,
 federaloes Noxzema
Me, jewelery cleaner
 Million Man March screamers
Rae Cartegna

The Longines, wrapped around the wrist

Moschino
Yo

Statuary yo floatin that snatch-uary
Aiyyo, blow a hole in your limo, weed pass the dutch
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo this is MC wizardry
, 
killa bee invasion
Men of respect, blessed with wisdom of the ancients
My words are blatant, lacerate necks for statements
I launch like lead projectiles, straight out the basement
I suplex your rep, left ruined like the Aztecs
Parasites, double edge dice your larynx
My hip-hop, is quarantined locked inside the detox
Under key lock
, 
it's like b-block and E-Glocks
You're ill, 
your trail ends, thoughts are frail
I strike the cypher, and let one survive to tell the tale
Of my state of grace
, 
I raise the stakes on snakes
Knock em off like 
the big eights
 for takin up space
Never did fear em, stick em with the truth serum
Who sent em
, 
arrest em before my charge is ended
Designated hitter flows
 split the transistor
Kinetic globes light when it shine, 
burns your retina
Urban journal, plus eternal broadcaster
Before and after, 
I be Self Lord And Master
[Ol Dirty Bastard]
I be the Ironside, get touched, with the chloride
Take walk with the Nine
 Finger bandits worldwide
Shaolin hillside
, 
full of homicides
FUCK you dissatisfied the double dyed black brown Iodine
[U-God]
Yo, box talk sequence, powerhouse kickout
Eyes dusty, wet, butt-naked with my dick out
I'm direct, 
golden
 best, golden chest is blessed
Scarce chapter, 
snatch a batch of Winterfresh
It sound farfetched, mountain men that be rich
You get buckshot, dummy-clapped, mummy-wrapped and stitched
The 
Jeffrey Dahmer
 
Notre Dame-r sing the song the strongest
Brute force bullethole straight through your chorus
Shank you with the think tank
, harmony cake cut
A can of ass-whoopin', Flurry shake break, you fucks
Struck, love crooks, why for lyin hooks
Chef cocaine cook
, a marvelous book
This 
deathbed doctrine
, 
paper for the youth
What remains, a saber-toothed tiger in the booth
[Cappadonna]
Last night, I took a trip down to Crown Heights
Fast life, females are trife, stay tight
I detect that parasite
, 
satellite
RZA beat makes me wanna fight get hyped
, 
come to do shows
My slang sound write secretary type
Backflip on the mic
, 
I'm the poor black man
Workin hard for the grand,
 
I understand clear
Don't fear
, 
peep my new gear it's different from yours
My style drop like drawers
, 
you see me on tours
Don't you wait to say peace, the kid from the street
Put my technology on the track,
 just then the core attack
Wu article, Cappa, five
, 
CD attack
But my talk stage live killa beehive
Bermuda my life angle,
 
rectangle gold fronts
Bring the gold dangle
, 
never make me throw darts
Check out my arts, when I release my smarts
Hot like Pop Tarts, aim me at the charts

[Intro: RZA]
Windshield, rappers are like gnats
They're gettin' splattered 'pon the windshield
Fallin' down like London Bridge, my blade split your onion head
Axe that like Paul Bunyan, Meth prefers the gun instead
Bong bong, put a hole inside your head
[Hook:] x2
We keep it rugged
We keep it rough
We keep it real
We keep it raw
[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
How come the streets don't want me to live?
Plus my niggas keep tellin' me fibs
But the devil done poisoned my wiz
I'm doin' this for my family and kids
I'm tryna be wealthy, take my time right and stay healthy
Said it before but I don't think nobody felt me
Yo tried to understand this hand that this life dealt me
I'm on the verge of a whole new makeover
My fake friends, they can take it like a takeover
I'm ready to eat, I'm ready to grip it
Got enemies everywhere, I got chicks that's wicked
Sick shit, niggas doin' wicked ass wig shit
Bid shit, tellin' jakes that I had the biscuit
Niggas be wantin' my leftovers
I'm like a general that died and lost some of his best soldiers
I burn holsters and I kill that dirt religion
Murk that pigeon and I shoot the television
[Verse 2: U-God]
Got that trey pound on you, run down on you
Hard boiled nigga, Clan top soil
My fam straight royal, I'mma die loyal
When them shooters come for you, better throw your flag 'em
I'm pure gun oil, let 'em see that hand cannon
Foundation strong, never ride a bandwagon
Andrew Jacksons, hand-to-hand transaction
Cops jumped out, caught him with his pants saggin'
Criminal individuals up in here
Wild like the theme park ride called The Buccaneer
Weed in the Tupperware, throw you off the upper tiers
Suweeee, I got all my niggas up in here
[Hook:] x2
[Bridge: RZA]
Imagine the sound of your face scrapin' up against the gate
Of a barbed wire fence, this is barbed iron fist
Heartthrob, iron dick, hoes slob the nob quick
This is odd, so throw it in your iPod quick
[Verse 3: GZA]
Lifeless activity, constant movement
Buyin' elasticity, such improvement
Sword held to where it collapses inward
Spillin' rhymes if it's Shaolin vineyards
RZA had a mixture, then he added sound to the picture
Co-author rewrote the scripture
Math worked from birth, doubled the net worth
Amplified in the time machine of early Earth
A two-way radio, simple yet complex
Receivers, transmitters, interest to contacts
The emergence of the earliest atoms
Transform to a level extremely hard to fathom
Same soup, different bowl, Wu ceramics
Same group on them large-scale dynamics
A wave triggered the burst, glass was shattered
Galactic matter served on a graphic platter
[Hook] x2
[Verse 4: Method Man]
Overachiever, 
power hungry overeater
I95, 
whip fly like an overseer
I'm overconfident but some might say I'm overeager
Or overzealous, especially when it's over cheeba
I got a soldier's features, I rock the coldest sneakers
My sneakers' so cold, can't wear 'em 'less you hold the heater
Can't push me over either, that go for dojas
I ain't got no love for posers neither, keep my composure
I'm focused, tryna roll the reefer, let's turn it up
Forget the cope, I'm tryna blow the speaker, that's all he wrote
One verse could turn your soul to ether
It's time you gave me my respects just like the old Aretha
, Mr. Meth
[Hook] x2

[Intro: 'Unbeaten 28' sample]
The Wu-Tang Clan will rise again
There are many of us, all working for the good of the Wu-Tang
Die
[Verse 1: StreetLife]
So get your egg crashed by my Hellz Wind Staff
While the feature broadcast is splashed to tell the news
Like Katie Chung,
 how the bullet collapsed his lung
His father watched in horror as he swallowed his tongue
Another youth dead before the age of 21
Left his son to grow in the ghettos of the slums
Where the shots echo for twisted metal for cash flow
React slow nigga and get P.L.O
By the lone gunner who took revenge for his brother
Who got slain last summer by a cocaine runner
A new year is dawning, new crews is forming
Rival gangs warring, blood steadily pouring
The streets are deep son, every day is like a 
rerun
So I reach out and try to teach one
But 85% uncivilized content
No tolerance so a lifetime is spent
Behind a cage bent smoked out and on a park bench
Killer instinct slave rap niggas get lynched
[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
So yo break that nigga arm fast as a fuck
Tell Ra, Goldie left my beige jacket in his truck
To all you slew-footed penguins, ducking from these
Hot rocks that's flaming, 
chocolate for all you rap Damians
Spraying cards 
espionage
, dodgeball square hard
Strip bars, no bras, wet leotards
In the making, next album 'Blood on Chef Apron'
Keep a Gambino PlayStation in your playpen
Discovery Channel, cats the Book of Daniel
Coke blunts hot as a fuck swatted bamboo
High school dropouts, 
baseheads get knocked the fuck out
On the regular for robbing a good nigga house
Rough cut raw doses, the unexplainable
Hot rock lava, 
gringo bowl of Frusen Gladjé
[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
What you know about this specialist armed dangerous
Hit you close range with this madness
Unique design shine like a deep dish
The beat kick technique split up your weak shit
Yes, the rhythm, the Rebel
Alone in my level heat it up past the boiling point of metal
Living legend, veteran known to set trend
Lethal Weapon, step through your section
With the Force like Luke Skywalker
Rhyme author, orchestrate mind torture
Live performer, 
bid the mic sayōnara
Borderline to insane, I rain firewater
Tape recorder, can't be saved by a court order
I got my sword across your throat you joke
[Verse 4: Method Man]
We on the run with the golden guns, get you none
When it reach out and teach someone, blaze their buns
Now I'm guilty by association
Times of blackness eclipsing the Sun, target practice
Commence when I throw these darts at these rappers
Ricochet, hit the charts,
 
bloody your mattress
Hold me down, Wu bloodkin,
 I'm going in
Shooting bullets at the top ten
, rhyme concoction
Blend like chameleon
All these niggas want cheese, is we mice or men, word up
We can go platinum but then still can't get no satisfaction
Once again back on the block crumb snatching
Blowing backs in cold blooded 9 assassins, 
time for action
Johnny Unitas
, handle that like arthritis
Still, hold a golden touch like King Midas
[Verse 5: RZA]
Drowning problems in Heinekens imported from Holland
Getting boosted off of Killa Bee pollen
Stone columns get trapped by drum tracks mac loud as gun claps
Pin a crab to death with a thousand thumbtacks
The Wu Sensai fold
, 
it be's the Wind Ninja scroll
Soul edged blade controls your Interpol
The Fig Newt', fruit from the forbidden tree root
I stay secluded in the Chamber training new recruits
With Fatal Guillotine,
 
the black hooded team what it means
When bullets scream from the hot Glock like rock from a sling
Pushed through like George Bush Operation Whoops
Shots get popped on the block cause them blood to gush
From digital to analogue, the Wu-Wear camouflage
The entourage squad we stomping through Zanzibar
Like herds of cattle, 
RZA plays the wall like a shadow
Connecting Brooklyn/Shaol like the Verrazanno-Narrows
[Verse 6: Raekwon]
Stash the cream though, 
Iceatollah
 ice style gleama
Lex graffiti name Ramo,
 hold em we rolling asking me though
Raps is hotter than hot tamales in Toledo
Pussy that shit she passing off to me though
We wax Ajax niggas with an axe, 
Maxamill
You could crash a mil’ got your back still
Scold em and fold em like the thousand dollar bills
Sit back eyeing y'all niggas out
Fakes that delegate we spitting fire out
Verb burglar, design the Wally shoe store reserve a jet status
Guyanese bird up on my mattress
Watch me mack this, 
Ralph Lauren goose inside a fashion
Yo, these hands is flooded and they mad quick
Strong approach like magnets, custom wood crane name
Styling rich, RZA made the waves in one chain
Feeling mics like, wheeling a bike, slide like
Step on his Klondike, get your dart right, we moving on it like
Wind breaker niggas get they face broke, jewellery get snatched
Magazine right on the low, fuck y'all cats

"Gotta get that, all the way" (3.5X)
[RZA]
Provider of the blow, yo enter the Wu-Tang crew
With verses that curses dudes like Tal Bo
Designed by the mastermind on the mic
(
Ohh, We Love You Rakeem
) Yea girl aight
Recite to his vidals to idol my title
There's no survival for any rival
Check it check it, my style is perfected
I attack when y'all least it expect it
Corel pounds fouls with the Shaolin style
Puff the White Owls
 then break wild
Wild wild west, oh yes I suggest
Ya bop to the beat, release all ya stress
I got the proper hip-hop to rock ya
Enter with the Wu-Tang flow, call a doctor
But there's no sickness, only rhyme inflictness
And a slang that seems to be addictive
I got the new rocks, get on Shorty Doo Wop
Love the baracud', come on dance on the block
So go and do your thang and let me du my thang
RZA puts the bang, Enter the Wu-Tang
[Hook: RZA, (sample)]
Can you Wu, Wu-Tang? (MY GOD!)
Can you Wu, Wu-Tang? (MY GOD!)
Can you Wu, Wu-Tang? (MY GOD!)
Can you Wuuu-Tang (MY GOD!)
[RZA]
Those who try to oppose me or even overthrow me
I'm takin more falls than Wile E. Coyote
You can't snag me, rag-tag or bag me
I'd have your ass runnin like Scooby-Doo and Shaggy
Make decisions, to what? 
'Catch that pigeon'
But I escape right from your fuckin vision
Blasted, as I mastered you bastards
You tried to be slick like 
Dastard, Dick Dastard
I got the remedy to kill off my enemies
Carry two guns all my time like Yosemite
Sam
, god damn, my style is mad flam
I SLAM! That's the kind of man that I am
The black butterfly, what a guy! What a guy!
Rhymes of harmony like a soft lullabye
So give a 
SUUUUUU!
 
Real love's gettin Power-U
In ninety-two, Enter the Wu
[Hook 2X]
[Outro: RZA]
Yea, the Wu-Tang Clan, 
somethin new in ninety-two
Comin through with the 
Fatal Flying Guillotines
So 
Protect Ya Neck
Power Equality, Allah Cee's Everything
That means peace..

"Execute them" [x4]
[Street Life sample played in the background]
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap
Might lose your eye sight, blood type, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
[Raekwon:]
Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, 
whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Czechoslovak' lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, Timberland cold war
Hailin from my necks down, rounds flip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dryer, hitman for hire, alien flyer
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up
[Masta Killa:]
Aiyyo witness the abduction, villa destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
A lotta shorties bustin, but they gotta cum some
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
PC don, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Exploerer lives gold, bless em wit a c-note, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as command in chief
Mad thorough, competition's intense for every inch of the borough
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap" [x2]
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"
[Inspectah Deck:]
Murder verser, twenty beam rap fiend server
Rhymes nurture minds, bustin like twin burners
Certified live, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, dance by the rest
They fit in contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off
"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" [x2]
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
I live to write the hype

[Produced by Frank Dukes]
[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
You stepped in the pit of the flame
You're lost on Beat Street
, I'mma throw spit on your name
Hear the roar when they mention the name
It's like Mike when he score with like two seconds left in the game
Small change don't step in my lane
I rock too hardbody, I click-bang, give 'em the pain
Nah man, can't get with them games
Your boy born with it, so how you gon' get him to change
You a lame putting shit in the game
Piranha wanna see me in the state greens and prisoner chains
But I'm smooth like the groove to the listener brain
And you only understand it if you been through my pain
Icy white spitters in frames
Hustle in my blood, bet my seeds gon' get it the same
Yes indeed I'm destined to reign, so ahead of the game
All aboard y'all get on the train
[Raekwon]
Banana clip Mac-aholic
, I slap your cap then join
Go in the freezer, got a skeezer tits out the toilet
Niggas is Norbits, running up on a dice game, call it
Preacher suit on, holding a raw fifth
Put that call in, his dough in the wall, stall him
Plastic bags laying in the floorway, yep
It's just dog's day, reservoir out in Utah, yo
Where my dope and marijuanas got bought in
Real Nikes, afford 'em, we pay to have a roast
Assassins is strapped, this the only way the yay grows
More leverage, more sevens, riding around with legends
Paying judges off, we be up in New York repping
[Verse 2: RZA]
Miramax movie magic
, cold beer on tap, rumor has it
Words put ideas on track
Footprints, I walk on Earth and appear on maps
Strive for at least 2.5 mill a year on cap
Wu Wear on my cap,
 dime piece on the lap
Three hundred push-ups a day put the crease on your back
Be the cap-fitting lieutenant black man
Who invented chopping samples up, to make the beats that's ascended to
Every genre of music, the whole sphere of music
I produced, arranged, engineered the music
[U-God]
My ear candy been dope,
 
my pen stroke like Zorro
Hit the heavy bag like Foreman in the Congo
Mini transmitter, night vision in the stronghold
Rock long robes, smell snakes with a strong nose
Every time the horn blow the Wu signal's back on
Transform, pack form, a whole 'nother platform
We coming back for 'em to smash the spot, kid
I'm on your team too, pass me the rock
Til the casket drop I'mma flip your wig
Rip clothes, honey didn't know my dick this big
You get kicked in the ribs with two chrome gauge
Deadly venom, I send 'em back to stone age

[Method Man]
I'm sayin, you-could-you could just come over top of that shit...
Did I hear it?
Nigga and bang your head, PUNK!!
[Ol' Dirty Bastard] *in background repeating*
SUCK A DICK!!! 6x
SUCK MY DICK!!!
[Method Man]
And it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't, it don't
It don't, it don't, it don't, it don't stop!
It all starts wit the pad and pen

Run a mile wit a racist, they iced it, I aced it
Placed it, right up in their face till they faced it
Hard to the dome like a chrome microphone
I'm ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bad to the bone to the bone
Danger zone, that's my life and my song
Keep it movin, hop along little doggies!
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Uh uh uh, FUCK YOU!!!
Drive The Mack Cadillac
Dark shade the window all sunny and black
Pitch antenna back of the car
Inside is a TV, even a bar
Bulletproof down, safe and sound
Chauffeur in the FRONT just to drive the Lexus all around
Give ya, give ya, give ya body a ride, nice and warm inside
Come to the Dirt Dog as the tummy rise
*Laughs* Enter
[RZA]
Yo yo my Wu-Tang cliff'll make your atom split
The power of my brain, you can't fathom it
Whoever go against the will of the grain will get slain
Don't EVER say thy God name in vain
My third eye electronic dragonfly spiral observe
Can record your words
And your lies and approach you
And have my Dogs come and Ghost you
When it comes to the bread son, the heat will toast you
[U-God]
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go
Guaranteed to flip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Outta control, now here we go
[Masta Killa]
Yo who got that nigga gassed like he can't get skimasked
Abducted from his doorstep
Dufflebag his head for the price of nothin
He's a glutton
What I'm manifestin each day is a lesson
Ya'll faggots, 
came to the School of the 36 Chambers
Copied on papers of scholars that earn dollars
We trendsetters in Wu leathers, trendsetters in Wu leathers, whatever
Chorus [U-God] 2x
Music makes me lose control
This is not just rock and roll
Hip hop digs right to the soul
Music makes me lose control
Wu-Tang, now we on a roll
On a rise, now here we go *Skip next line on the second time of chorus*
Music makes me lose control (2x)
Guaranteed to rip the show
RZA beats is outta control
Outta control, outta control, outta control
Now here we go

[Intro: RZA]
Feelings. The emotional side of a man, woman or a child's character. A response or tendency to respond. A belief, which can be vague, illogical, but mostly, irrational
[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
I never gave a fuck on how the next nigga felt
I rocked a heavyweight belt cause that's the way I felt
Still feel, so inspired to write a rhyme that's ultimately
No other emcee could get with me, is way I felt
Don't forget the first time you heard me rhyme the way
The first time you heard "Protect Ya Neck", the way you felt
Like no other hip hop record ever made you felt
Cards dealt, played my handle, when no matter how I felt
[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Every time we touch the mic, you know our lyrics is felt
Worldwide, live, polaroid shit, all my homies is
And we ride out to all of our music is
Yeah, we gets busy, teach the youth  because we know how it felt
Give em Knowledge of self expressing in a way that it's felt
So each and every person to recognize what they felt
Watch your mind state because the evil could be felt
You never know, how when I first came out, how my brothers felt
I've been going through it, plus a lot of deep pain was felt
We would last for a night, but a better tomorrow
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I felt the angel of death breathe
When I felt the four fifths something told me squeeze
I felt like it was the end of a dynasty
Like I was fighting a clique of five Chinese thieves
Karate slippers with slip on's so I kept slippin'
The floor was too smooth felt like I couldn't catch a grip in
Felt like Dragonfly Jones, was Dragonfly Tone
So I kept spitting, woke up when I heard the phone
[Verse 4: Method Man]
I never gave a what on how the next rapper felt
I take that rapper's belt myself, I feel how Cappa felt
I don't really need help, use a sharpie, don't need the felt
Marker,
 
walk on water, I see how Jesus felt
No rhyme or reason, just bleeding, my every breathing's felt
This about a thesis that even paraplegics felt
These boys ain't needing, they barely breathing, believe it, seen it
Till you got cheated, you couldn't tell me how cheating felt
I'm not a failure, I couldn't tell ya how losing felt
Might not have nailed her, but I can tell ya how spooning felt
Remember when you first heard the rap and the way it felt
I burned the track with a murder rap and I know it's felt
[Hook]

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, one two one two Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
It's the Wu, creepin in the shadows Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang)
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
Sir I, Excalibur
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
(Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang) 2X
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
[Verse One: Inspectah Deck]
My rap style swing like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze, my solar razor burn through shades
Rhyme grenades raid the airwaves
, 
catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Born master
, 
with the faster blade,
 
track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones
, 
bones fracture
Limited edition composition
 
spark friction
Non-fiction
, the calm bomb, keep your arms distance
Zero tolerance
, 
dominant intelligence
Wu original
, true colors step from the melanin
The most high
, most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer
 
black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high, leave styes in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, 
poly like
 
Cochran
, and 
Sharpton
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap, 
kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a British Bulldog, observe the stacks
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
(repeat both lines 4X)
[Verse Two: Masta Killa]
Now all pay tribute to this entity
A spark that surges through the undergrowth
Overwhelming the populace from the entry
The Wu-Tang Dynasty, has emerged
From this elite fleet
I was appointed to strike the vital nerve
Mouths tend to utter and speak empty words
Observe the magnetic attraction
 
as we breathe
Seeds of MC's at these fake ass industry niggas
Feed off, the chrome mic tend to squeeze off
And spray, an array of shots
That travel downwind, just respect my prolific pen
As I send, the minds of the weak
To rise and take power I blew tower-ing over the land
As we stand
, expanding our 
CREAM
A dollar to every grain of sand
Let the mind use the physical as planned
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
[Verse Three: Cappadonna]
Yo, yo, this is Beirut
Try to comprehend check out my new suit
Gods blend aim take fire pure destruction
Disappear from here, 
my year,
 
drop the stupid LP's everywhere
Fallin out the sky tall sniper
Raps by Cappadonna hit the countryside
Poetry whirlpool,
 
RZA and True collide
We produce article exception to the rule
We the black men that struck oil
, 
the hardboiled
Cats that made that Watergate thing go spoiled
The heavy-handed, locked down stranded with Cyrus
Wu Pirates, sneak inside the club, low eyes
Low down dirty, twelve thirty, night time crawlers
Off-the-wallers, basketball gun brawlers
Smoked out throw both fists for nine-seven
Slang reverend,
 
put the best work in
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
"Oh baby, for heavens sake"
(repeat both 4X)

[Intro]
Yo, uh huh
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang
[Hook: Ozzy Osbourne]
You think I'm kinda crazy, but I gotta few regrets
Livin like a king, with a pocket full of grits
We come from different worlds, don't you ever forget
I'm just a poor little white boy, showin my respect
[Inspectah Deck]
Like Willie Mays
My eyes Purple Haze,
 
my solar razor burn through shades
My grenades raid the airwaves
, catch this rap page
I glide like, hovercrafts on the Everglades
Boom master, with the faster blade, track slasher
Manufacture poems to microphones, bones fracture
Limited edition composition spark friction
Non-fiction, the calm bomb keep your arm distant
Zero tolerance, dominant intelligence
Wu original, true colors step from the melanin
The most high, 
most try, to get close by
And overthrow I, but choke, with they hopes up high
I circulate the tri-state and vibrate beyond the Richter
Flies sense to flock when they spot this live nigga
The crowd seducer black your third eye before I lose ya
Verbal high I leave stars in the eyes of Medusa
Top ten, parley like Cochran, it's often
Narrow margin, of your odds to dodge the marksman
Murder rap
, 
kill you soft like Roberta Flack
Words attack like a british bulldog, observe the stacks

[Intro: Method Man]
If you got it, light it up (8X)
[Method Man]
Ain't no shook in 'em, 
Pyrex pots is hot, fiends is cooking 'em
Little niggas hugging the block, cops is booking 'em
Women hugging they purse when they spot the crook in 'em
Back when little J got shot,
 pops was whooping 'em
Little noses dripping with snot, ock, now look at 'em
The ghetto got a hook in 'em now, drugs, stay pushing 'em
Used to throwing dirt in these blunts, now, it's kush in 'em
Used to tell these chicks to shut up, now, he's shooshing 'em
Get cash, get that ass, or put a foot in 'em
Iron Flag, flag that cab, Bedford and Put-e-nam
There ain't no puss in 'em, dick, dildo, or gush in 'em
Niggas still got that juks in 'em
[Hook 2X: Ghostface Killah] + (Raekwon)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he drunk and he run his mouth (Get 'em out ya way pa)
If he front then we stomp 'em out (Get 'em out ya way pa)
(Get 'em out ya way pa, move, move, move)
[U-God]
I'm seduced by the chrome
, 
it's a ruthless poem
It took a little time to get his juices going
Producers know him
, as the 
kid with the Iron Palm
Righteous hammer
, 
examine the firearm
Approach or get fired on
, permanent chest scar
Empire Strikes Back, check out the Death Star
Bless y'all, wet y'all, do the impossible
Where I'm from, we use dum-dums in the arsenal
Highly sparkable, get stretched off the knuckle check
Known to scuffle, I take it to the upper deck
Universal conquest, kung fu, buckle vets
In a dufflebag, max yo, a couple techs
Give 'em ear hustle, Wu brand, we programmed
Next time we dance, it won't be a slow jam
I fear no man
, 
son, you get lynched up
Nigga bitch, get Frankenstein stitched up
[Hook]
[Masta Killa]
Yeah, 
voice skipping off percussion
Give it to 'em how they love it, slow flow, deadly, beloved
All praise, the daunting, calm yet
So alarming, without a word being spoken
A thought with no voice, just a nod and a look
The contract was took, straight cash, off the books
A major pawn took a Don, look, he's armed
With a few black rooks from the heart of the Crook
Shook ones look while they hung him on Hercules hooks
They found his body near a shallow brook, escaped on foot
Switched the look up, out of state, he got the hook up
The flipped cake, thought lighter than the feather
Yet heavier than weight, when my mindstate starts to break, take cover
Over RZA instrumental, I'm damn near invincible, it's simple
[Hook 2X]
[Outro: kung fu sample]
Tell me, what are they like?
They got holes in the top, five round holes
While I was watching, this stranger, hit them
But his fingers went right through the bone
So then, they've... mastered it
It's some style of kung fu, you know it?
The Skeleton Claw

[Intro : RZA]
1,2, 1,2, yo check this out, 
it's the jump off right now
I want everybody, to put your work down, put your guns down
And report to the pit, the gravel pit
Leave your problems at home, leave your children at home
We gon' take it back underground
, 
I be Bobby Boulders
Wu-Tang Clan on yo' mind one time
It's the jump off, so just jump off my nigga
[Hook : Paulissa Moorman]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
[Meth]
Ha, holocaust from the land of the lost
Behold the pale horse, off course (off course)
Follow me, Wu-Tang gotta be
The best thing since 
Starks and Clark Wallabees
African killer bees
 
blackwatch
On your radio, blowin out yo' watts
From Park Hill, the house on haunted hill
Every time you walk by your back get a chill
Let's peel, who want to talk rap skills
I spit like a semi-automatic to the grill
Elbow grease, and elbow room
Baby play me, baby fall down, go boom
Party people gather round, count down to apocalypse
[U-God]
I'm the kid with the 
golden arms
[Meth]
And I'm the motherfuckin 
hott nikks
 
pass the blunt
My nigga don't front
You had it for a minute but it seem like a month
Now I'm chokin, smokin
, 
hopin
I don't croakin, from overdosin
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Wu and Meth got you open (open), let's ride
Can't stand niggas that floss too much
Can't stand Bentleys they cost too much
Kid wanna get up then kid get touched
Kid wanna stick up then kid get stuck
I'm the one that called your bluff
When your boy tried to act tough
Remember what Ol' Dirty said: "I'll fuck yo' ass up!"
Now listen
[Meth over hook]
Back, back and forth and forth
[Ghostface]
E with the English, extinguish styles extremist
Bald head beamers run wild
It's the kid with the gold cup
Stepped out like what
What's poppin, and y'all niggas dobo
Blastin shae shae, chocolate shortae
Rich color mocks
, 
rock those all day
1960 shit I'm Goldie
That's right motherfucker don't hold me
The world's greatest, Las Vegas, paid as rock
Skin painted on my face look ageless
Perfect combos, Ghost bang out condos
Jeff from Hamo, ex three bangos
Bancos, stank hoes in plain clothes
Change those, bang those, same old, same old
[Raekwon]
Yeah y'all, straight up this the jump off right here
The gravel pit, word up represent, rock the boulders
All my rich gangsta style, killers
, y'all know what time it is
Shorty do your thing, get up on that shit right now boo, do you
That's what I'm talkin 'bout
[U-God]
Yo, step to my groove, move like this
When we shoot the gift of course it's ruthless
Grab the mic with no excuses
In a sec, 
grab the Tecs and loot this
Executing, shaking all sets, and I'm breaking all hecks
I'm taking all bets, move all best, who want the dram' next
You all stank, we got the bigger bank
Bigger shank to fill your tank
Still the same kill you for real, while you crank
Slide, do or die, fry to bake
Admire the greats, on fire wit a heart of hate
Bitter shark, every part I take, heavy darts that quake
It's okay, all fakes, get caught by the dropkicks
You know the thrill, yes it's Park Hill
Yo we hit 'em with the hot grits
On the go, check the flow, saying Wu don't rock shit
Stop quick, hold the gossip, stop sweating my pockets
I hear the hot shit
[Hook Two : Paulissa Moorman]
Check out my gravel pit
A mystery unraveling
Wu-Tang is the CD that I travel with
Don't go against the grain if you can't handle it
You don't have to move a mountain
Just give me enough strength to climb
Oh Lord ! Don't take away my stumbling vows
And lead me a round
[Outro speech]
Yakub, maker and creator of the devil. Swine merchant... your time is near at hand. Fuck with me and your time will be now. Your presence here effects the mind of my people like a fever. You, Yakub, are the bearer of nine thousand nine hundred and ninety nine diseases, evil, corrupt, porkchop-eatin' brain!

[Intro: Method Man w/ sample] + (Sunny valentine)
We got butter (8X)
(The gun'll go, the gun'll go...
The gun'll go...)
[Raekwon]
Aiyo, one thing for sure, keep you of all
Keep a nice crib, fly away, keep to the point
Keep niggas outta ya face, who snakes
Keep bitches in they place, keep the mac in a special place
Keep moving for papes, keep cool, keep doing what you doing
Keep it fly, keep me in the crates
Cuz I will erase shit, on the real, note, you'se a waste
It's right here for you, I will lace you
Rip you and brace you, put a nice W up on ya face
Word to mother, you could get chased
It's nothing to taste, blood on a thug if he gotta go
All I know is, we be giving grace
This is a place, from where we make tapes
We make 'em everywhere, still in all, 
we be making base
Y'all be making paste, these little niggas, they be making shapes
Our shit is art, yours is traced
[Hook: Sunny Valentine]
This is the way that we rolling in the streets
You know when we roll we be packing that heat
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go...
[Method Man]
This is, 
Poverty Island
, man, these animals don't run
Slums where the ambulance don't come
Who got the best base? Fiends waiting to smoke some
Approach something, ask him where he getting that coke from
My dudes hug blocks like, samurai shogun
Cuz no V and no ones, equalling no fun
Who want to treat they nose, huh? Body'll go numb
My woman need funds, plus her hair and her toes done
It is what it is though, you fuck with the kid flow
That make it hard to get dough, the harder the kid go
Harder the piff blow, harder when it snow
The pinky and the wrist glow, this here, what we live for
Get gwop, then get low, but first thought
We gotta get the work off, the gift and the curse, boss
Yeah, see I'm the shit yo, the dirt in the fit, no
Hustling from the get-go, the motto is get more
[Hook]
[Masta Killa]
We was quiet flashy brothers, strapped all along
With the dirty .38 long, twelve hour shift gate
Took case, state to state, you think he won't hold his weight?
Put ya money on the plate and watch it get scrapped
We get ape up in that club, off that juice and Henn
And it's a no win situation fucking with them
You mean like Ewing at the front at the rim, finger roll a Dutch
Million dollar stages touched, techs, gauges bust
Trust no one, the lone shogun, rugged Timb boot stomper
Damaging lyrical mass destruction launcher
Nothing can calm the quakeage when I break, kid
Peace to my brothers up north, doing state bids
[Hook]
[Hook 2: Sunny Valentine]
Whoa... this is the way we be rolling in the club
You know when we roll we be packing .32 snubs
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
The gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go, the gun'll go
[Outro: sample to fade]
We got butter...

The vandal, too hot to handle
Cause times is changed and life is strange.
Come to my center, you enter the winter.
What justifies the homicide, when he dies?
It's always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind.
Something in the street went, BANG BANG!
Don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad.
For those that murdered me shall stand before God.
No longer brothers, we’re unstable
Like Cain when he slew Abel.
Take in my energy, breathe and know the rest,
Cause the good die young and the hard die best.

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Technique is ill son,
 
watch how I spill one
Peace to Biggie, 2Pac, Big L and Big Pun
Havoc on the streets of Staten, snitches
House niggas, children watch as they produce the same pattern
Somebody raped our women, murdered our babies
Hit us with the cracks and guns in the early 80's
For those that murdered me shall stand before God
To fall at the hands of fate, then out comes the rod
Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back
What the fuck is going on, I can't go to sleep
Feds jumping out their jeeps, I can't go to sleep
Babies with flies on they cheeks, it's hard to go to sleep
Ish bowled two 6's twice, I couldn't go to sleep
Aiyyo we deep in the stairs, we carry big guns
Whippy got hit up with the big shit, bong bong
Stop at the cheeba spot,
 
then pass the leak spot
Drove past y'all niggas again, you took a cheap shot
Not knowing, fucking with me you get your meat chopped
You thought we fell on our face, you need to be stopped
Call on the chariots,
 
call on an ambulance
You better smile, my nigga you on Candid Cam
Gangsta broad, these be the laws, walk with big balls
Nigga, motherfucking eunuch, I even take which was yours
I'm the nigga that made you, man
When your rap wasn't doing well I'm the nigga that gave you a hand
[Hook: Isaac Hayes]
Don't kill your brother
, learn to love each other
Don't get mad, cause it ain't that bad
Look at who you are, you've come too far
It's in your hands, just be a man
Get the jelly out your spine
Cobwebs out of your mind
[Verse 2: RZA]
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut my eyes
They shot the father at his mom's building seven times
They shot Malcolm in the chest, front of his little seeds
Jesse watched as they shot King on the balcony
Exported Marcus Garvey cause he tried to spark us
With the knowledge of ourselves and our forefathers
Oh Jacqueline you heard the rifle shots crackling
Her husband's head in her hands, you tried to put it back in
America's watching, blood-stained ink blotches
Medgar took one to the skull for integrating college
What's the science? Somebody? This is 
trick knowledge
They try to keep us enslaved and still scrape for dollars
Walking through Park Hill, drunk as a fuck
Looking around like these Devils
I'm ready to break this world down
They got me trapped up in a metal gate
Just stressed out with hate
And just give me no time to relax and use my mind to meditate
What should I do, grab a blunt or a brew
Grab a .22 and run out there and put this fucking violence in you
I can't go to sleep, I can't shut em, son.. I
[Outro - Isaac Hayes]
Don't let the game make you lose your head
You should be calling the shots instead
The power is in your hands
Stop all this crying and be a man

[RZA] Yo, check check it
[Tekitha] You can never defeat
[RZA] Yo, check the method of this shit right here one time
[Tekitha] The Gods
[RZA] Sparking your braincells to the upmost
[Tekitha] Impossible
[RZA] Unlimited epidemics being spreaded
[Tekitha] You can never defeat
[RZA] You know, we try and add on for y'all niggas
[Tekitha] The Gods
[RZA] Yo, yo
[Verse One: RZA]
Fusion of the five elements, to search for the higher intelligence
Women walk around celibate, living irrelevant
The most benevolent king, communication through your dreams
Mental pictures been painted, Allah's heard and seen
Everywhere, throughout your surrounding atmosphere
Troposphere, thermosphere, stratosphere
Can you imagine from one single idea, everything appeared here
Understanding makes my truth, crystal clear
Innocent black immigrants locked in housing tenements
Eighty-Five percent tenants depended welfare recipients
Stapleton's been stamped as a concentration camp
At night I walk through, third eye as bright as a street lamp
Electric microbes, robotic probes
Taking telescope pictures of globe, babies getting pierced with microchips
Stuffed inside their earlobes,
 
then examinated
Blood contaminated, vaccinated, lives fabricated
Exaggerated authorization, Food and Drug Administration
Testing poison in prison population
My occupation to stop the inauguration of Satan
Some claim that it was Reagan
, 
so I come to slay men
Like Bartholomew, cause every particle is physical article
Was diabolical to the last visible molecule
A spaceknight like Rom
, 
consume planets like Unicron
Blasting photon bombs from the arm like Galvatron
[Verse Two: U-God]
United Nations, gun bias style patient
Formulating rap plural acapella occupation
Conquer land like Napoleon
, 
military bomb fest
We want sanitary food, planetary conquest
Thug peoples on some hardco' body shit
Get your shit together 'fore the fuck Illuminati
 hit
Dreams is free and escape is sleep
For a fool peep 
jewels
, 
keep tools for tough time
The rule of rough mind, elevate, stay behind
The sun gotta shine, keep on, 
cremate
The whole Babylon
, times up, move on
Kings on your pawn, checkmate, 
no fakes
Supposed through the gate
, c
ase closed
Things get froze
, 
when it comes time, chosen ones
Will holding guns
, we take flight with no fright
And attack, never fear cause our words is clear
What's been done can't be undone Son, we can't care
Cause the last days and times are surely here
Snakes and flakes get blown, by the righteous ones
Divine minds bind, we unified as one
Half of black folk, we half broke, smoke a bowl of weed shit
Our everlasting essence 
stay flying over Egypt
[Hook: Tekitha]
For you to defeat, the Gods
Impossible, you can never... defeat
The
Gods
Impossible
For you to defeat, the Gods
[Verse Three: Ghostface Killah]
Call an ambulance, Jamie been shot, word to Kimmy
Don't go Son, nigga you my motherfuckin heart
Stay still Son, don't move, just think about Keeba
She'll be three in January
, your 
young God
 needs ya
The ambulance is taking too long
Everybody get the fuck back
, excuse me bitch, gimme your 
jack
One, seven one eight, nine one one
, 
low battery, damn
Blood comin out his mouth, he bleedin badly
Nahhh Jamie, don't start that shit
Keep your head up, if you escape hell we gettin fucked up
When we was eight, we went to Bat Day to see the Yanks
In Sixty-Nine, his father and mines, they robbed banks
He pointed to the charm on his neck
With his last bit of energy left, told me rock it with respect
I opened it, seen the God holdin his kids
Photogenic, tears just burst out my wig
Plus he dropped one, oh shit
, 
here come his Old Earth
With no shoes on, screamin holdin her breasts with a gown on
She fell and then lightly touched his jaw, kissed him
Rubbed his hair, turned around the ambulance was there
Plus the 
blue coats
, 
Officer Lough
, 
took it as a joke
Weeks ago he strip-searched the God and gave him back his coke
Bitches yellin, Beenie Man swung on Helen
In the back of a cop car, 
Dirty Tasha
 are tellin
But suddenly a chill came through it was weird
Felt like my man, was cast out my heaven now we share
Laid on the stretcher, blood on his 
Wally's
 like ketchup
Deep like the full assassination with a sketch of it
It can't be, from Yoo-hoo to Lee's
Second grade humped the teachers, about to leave
Finally this closed chapter, comes to an end
He was announced, pronounced dead, y'all, at twelve ten
[Outro: Raekwon and Tekitha]
Now what my man is trying to tell y'all
Is that across the whole globe
The murder rates is increasin, and we decreasing
So at the same time, when you play with guns
When you play with guns Son
That causes the conflict of you going against your own
You hear me, so let's pay attention
Straight up and down, cause this is only a story
From the real

"The story you're about to see, occured along the main
Trading route, on the border between the North and South..
At a small outpost called Red Clay Village."
[RZA]
What the fuck y'all niggas thought, huh? What you thinkin bitch?
Are you stupid son, must be stupid kid
What the fuck is wrong? It's the Wu bitch
Ain't got a clue bitch, tie ya shoe bitch
Get the fuck back, 'fore we break a f... listen
Tryin to tell y'all niggas, give you a fair warnin
Just a chance to live, so you can see ya kids
Yo son nah, before I split ya wig
I'd rather feed you this, but you ain't wanna eat it
So now you got to FEEL IT!!
{*beat changes*}
[Masta Killa]
Yo what the, yo
Let me fuck it one more time then y'all can fuck
Y'know how we do it in the hood
Yo.. yeah.. turn the mic up, yeah, yo
Y'all niggas better rock y'all hoodies
Take money 
snatch jewelry
, in the hood
You find the best woman lookin good
Diamond she need polishin
In my hood, all the gunshot legal
At the same time we gotta stop killin our people
Keep it in the hood, niggas walk with they gun
Keep it in the hood that's where we come from
I rep Brooklyn, home of the gangsta
I know a few murderer, drug dealer
In the hood, we speak mathematics and build
What's the total weight of the brain, Allah real
Slang jacks and hold gats, in the hood
; 
80 proof
Get my dick sucked on the roof of the projects
Dice game in the park
, 
blunt sessions after dark
Movin with the Wesson
Welcome to the God we build and drop a lesson
Pussyhole testin, in the hood
Got the word from the hoodrat, shorty on the wood
[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say
Murder, no time fi talk, one fi
Murder, men an' dem ah talk 'bout di
Murder, Masta Killa come calm wit nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying
Nying, nying, nying, nying, nying, me say murder
[Inspectah Deck]
Ay yo, we boys in the hood, big bad wolves in the woods
It ain't all good, pass the goods
Deep in the project halls waitin to shine
Walk with a nine and talk with gang signs
In the hood, niggas put twenty on Hoopties
Four heads, one forty ounce and a loosie
And keep dough on the flip
, a ho on the strip
And roll dick throw on the flip
Weed clouds thick enough to block the sun
Cops come, but thugs never drop the gun, understood?
Far from ya Hollywood
From day one, I vowed I would keep it in the hood
From project chicks with hips and slim waists
From five dollar plates apartment six-eighths
O.G, I spit G to the young ones
I keep it in the hood that's where I come from
[Hook: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah
Murder, rude boy ya pop off ah
Murder, nine millimeter me say

[Streetlife]
This is the place where thugs is born - in the hood
Blink to long ya life is gone
 - in the hood
Convicts still live with they mom
And they whole family tree is tattooed on they arm
 - in the hood
Crack fiends'll furnish a 'Llac
 - in the hood
African's be drivin cabs - in the hood
In the streets the ghetto 
is
 hot
And the illest gangsters, on the block with cops
 - in the hood
The ones you love'll fill you with slugs
 - in the hood
Babies born addicted to drugs
 - in the hood
We make life or death decisions
And the school system is like a minimal prison
So you 
can't knock the hustle
 or the life that I'm livin
In the hood, it ain't all good, repent or you sinnin
[Hook 2X: Suga Bang Bang]
Murder, bad boy ya block off ah

Yo, yo one two one two, yo live in effect
We got the king Ruler Zig-Zag-Zag Allah
Commonly known to y'all as the RZA
Yo before we go into side two or side B of this double CD
Knahmsayin I want to give y'all a little announcement man
For the last year there's been a lot of music comin out

And make that shit R&B, rap and bullshit yaknowhatI'msayin?
Or make that shit funk
Fuck that, this is MCin right here, this is hip-hop
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang gonna bring it to you in the purest form
I got the GZA on my side, Killah Priest
Sunz of Man, Royal Fam, Killarmy, Gravediggaz, 12 O'Clock
Yo, we want to let y'all niggas know somethin man
To my people all across the world; Japan, Europe -- knowhatI'msayin?
Canada, knowmean -- Austria, Germany, Sweden
Yo, this is true hip-hop you listenin to right here
In the pure form, this ain't no R&B with a wack nigga takin the loop
Be loopin that shit thinkin it's gonna be the sound of the culture
YaknowhatI'msayin? (That player bullshit)
YaknowhatI'msayin? All that player dressin up
On this shit, actin like this some kind of fashion show man
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is hip-hop right here
YaknowhatI'msayin? This is lyrics, MCin
And yo, to y'all niggas who think you going to become an MC overnight
YaknowhatI'msayin? Better snap out that fuckin dream
Man it takes years for this you Cat in the Hat ass rappers
You Dr. Seuss, Mother Goose, simple minded
(Stop runnin up on niggas with all that wack shit)
Word up man (talking bout "you MC")
You ain't no MC; niggas ain't made for this yaknowhatI'msayin?
This shit was Only Built 4 Cuban Linx -- we told y'all niggas back then
And then everybody wanted to change their motherfuckin name
YaknowhatI'msayin? We come out with a style
Now everybody wanna imitate our style
 
and all you producers out there
YaknowhatI'msayin? It's all good to show love to a nigga
But stop bitin my shit, yaknowhatI'msayin?
Come from your own heart with this shit
And all y'all MC's, stop biting from my niggas
We told ya'll niggas on the fucking Cuban Linx album
Don't bite our shit, y'all niggas keep biting
Yo, I'm going to tell y'all something man
It's time for the Wu revolution right here
To all my niggas across the world
Raise your motherfucking fist in the air
And get ready for the Triumph
Cause the Gods is here to take over this shit
Word up, peace

[Intro/Hook: Raekwon]
Murder one of y'all niggas..
Get to hurtin one of y'all niggas..
Bitches, snatch the shirt off one of y'all niggas
Kick dirt
[Raekwon the Chef]
Color Glocks splitters just listen there's UFO visitors
Fly paintings remainin, reclinin pro-comissioner
One boot off he Rudolph, know he hyped flew off
Hibernatin, dead in the makin, ear-rake him, gear-rake him
Technician murderer, Wu hit the universe
Our words is crush, fingers icy slush, ringers wants Mercedes bust
Tip bottles, Movado, sailin in some Wu googles you follow
Mail and jail letters, sendin niggas lottos
What made you murder my flow, what made you rival my clothes
What made you -- fuck it, yo son these niggas gotta owe
I think a lot of flows, I flip exotic hoes
We paintin pictures if it's was drizzies, seen a lot of those
Gettin fly with Ghost, power just buy the boats
RZA your vision is exquisite, daddy hide your scrolls
Platonic chronic shows, tonic prose
Off the meter Panasonic know, son line me a ho
[Masta Killa]
Devestatin shockwaves strikin the nation
Newsflash, warn the people, assassination
The hour of detonation, pure untampered or mixed in any form
In any form mixed untampered it's pure
Dissect each line of the rhyme
Find my ingredients and nutrients
Teach patience and obediance before movement
Killer bee student enrollment
I'm out your control and expose if it's synthetic
Quote these plush degrees as I inject, there's many at risk
Slang therapist 
Shallah Rae
Bless the people, with magnificent wordplay
[Hook]
[Inspectah Deck]
Aiyyo you know the half, some get respect, most we show the path
They quoted tracks while we spoke math, blowin fast
Expose the craft, 
first picks chosen in the draft
I don't flash, hoes love me cause I hold a stash
Known to blast, paramedics couldn't close the gash
Floatin past in a 'Nail with the oak dash
Show the cash, watch it blow in half, it's no fair
They goin mad, check their tape recorders and their notepads
Crabs wanna play me close and grab
Can't believe you on the canvas, I'm just throwin jabs
Where the powers you supposed to have, hand in your soldier rag
You posin bad, show your ass son, you won't last
With heavy weights that elevate the whole mass
Compose a smash, rollin grass at Ghost lab
{*samples scratched: "drink to your new life.. iron flag brothers"*}

[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Machine gun Rap for all my niggas in the back
Stadium packed
, 
linebacker nigga flash stacks
See through yellow lines, rock a fly jersey in the summertime
God
, 
magic marker rap,
 
bleed betadine
 relaxed
Wrote this, coming at you crab ass culprits
Snatch ya ice off, chilling in the back, throw the lights off
Waves, water blend, rhyme flow in slow motion
Thick snare
, 
I'm feeling like a snail in the ocean
What's your wish? Wanna Kringle like Kris?
 
Melodic single darts
Snap a nigga just like fish
, 
you fucked up
Some rich niggas you done test, yo
Select the wrong apartment and niggas pulled up your dress
Style, molest that
, 
Canal chain,
 
nigga where ya vest at?
Flex'll make me wanna bless that, yo
Saddam Hussain niggas

light the torch, we flaming niggas
Autograph that

[Hook: RZA]
(It's Yours!)
The world in the palm of your hand

Double LP from Wu-Tang Clan
(It's Yours!)
[Verse 2: U-God]
Yo, super freak physique like Raphael Saadiq
Baby love the ganja leaf everyday of the week
Super friends wake up
, 
deluxe gourmet beats
The night is right, I might find me a suite
It's a quarter full moon
, 
I arrive, women swoon
Well groomed, 
dance hall packed, full room
Lady move, 
peep my glide
, peep my zoom
Keep in stride, smoke the 
lye
 smoke the boom
Feel the fumes
, 
consume toxic tunes
Hell bound, species forty ounce typhoon
The ultra-violet scream machine
 
move your body touch
The totem pole wobble, 
Ark builders, God's thrust
Beams of light, 
stop ya breathing, it's hunting season
Honey eye-balling down for no reason
Grab her close, play post, wind and wax floors
Never mind the laws cause tonight It's Your's
[Verse 3: RZA]
Stop the fader of 
the
 RAM, 
blast more watts through my pre-amp
Them can't stress the beat vamp the shit'll get blamp
At full throttle, hot lead propels throughout my nozzle
Crack your soul like bottles, leave you stiff as models
You fag,
 
you couldn't pull one drag off my blunt
You couldn't punch your way out of a wet paper bag
With scissors in your hands
.
bitch the RZA
I stand close to walls, like Number 4 The Lizard
And channel through 
solar panels
, 
blast off like Roman Candles
Rap vandals, stomp your ass like 
Wahoo McDaniel
You cocker spaniel dogs, can't fuck with our catalog
Put your lights out and leave your brain inside a fog
[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
It's only natural, actual facts are thrown at you
The impact will blow trees back and crack statues
Million dollar rap crews fold, check the sick shit
Explicit, I crystallize ya rhyme till you can sniff it
We live this
, 
fitted hats low conceal the
 
crooked eye
No surprise, verbal stick up, put 'em high
Rebel I
 
outlaw, split second on the draw
Blow the door off this shit like bricks of C-4
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Check out my beaver,
 
baby blue Glock in the safe
Seen Dorothy in the garden getting ski row eight
We hold a belt Son
, 
that's my word
Spot a rapper run him down, throw him out in the third, yo check it
I think like the man behind a register
Evergreen smoking estates, 
Divine and Power made me treasurer
With third down, six to go flash his strobe lights
I'm open, RZA hit me off lovely and I love him
With root beer thoughts,
 
here's a tennis court for your birthday
The babyface of Rap politic with Sade
Avenging eagle crooks, rock the "W" and "Spiegel" books
Anheuser-Busch kings came through
 and stopped your whole 
Juks
Spitfire Kangols, watch Tony train a gang of hoes
Painful like hearing the news, like when your man go
Ends blow, windy at times watch the room
Sexy girl love the shit out the song, now watch her water break

[Junior Reid]
Him speaketh in tongues into the hearts of all flesh
Yeah stanyoi
Whoi
[Ghostface Killah]
Oh God, I beg for forgiveness
So help me Lord, yes I beg for forgiveness
Deep in my heart, please, I'm crying for forgiveness
Allah U Akbar, I fall to my knees for forgiveness
Branded by the steel iron, bullets flying
Ladies being hit through wickedness, I'm losing my grip
I thought we lived by the books, The Bible, Koran
We pick cotton, my back is still hot and dark and
They threw burners in our babies' faces
Pale hands that looked scary touched our bodies in the strangest places
Sweat from the white man's head
Fell on our daughters as she cried, giving white man head, almighty
Alrighty, niggas is screwing
God won't you tell me why these ho niggas is screwing?
I'm sorry father, sacrifice me, leave me wife
Sacrifice me twice, so my kids can see paradise...
[Junior Reid]
So we heed our god king Selassie I, Jah Rastafari
Who is seated in zion and reigneth in all
In the hearts of all flesh
Whoa wow
Let my task oh Jah with them that strive with me
Fight against them Whoa wow that fight against me
Whoa wow
Take hold thy shield and rock and stand up for my health
Oh Jah, oh Jah, only you can comfort me
La la la, la la la la la, la la la la
La la la whoi stand out
[RZA]
Curse to the wicked snakes who try to snatch the truth away
Cursed be the ones who try to take our youth away
Peace to the black, the brown, the red, yellow, and white seed
We don't discriminate man over color/creed
They tried to snatch up our beats, son, and steal our culture
And German Catholics, whitewashing Roman sculptures
How dare you try to deny Allah's intelligence?
Kidnap the truth, and destroying the black evidence
[Junior Reid]
Glory be to the father
Glory be to the son (Glory be to the holy one)
Glory be to the holy one
The holder of creation whoi
As Jah was in the beginning is now and forever shall be
Jah world
Jah world without end whoi
So we heed our god king Selassie I, Jahova God, Jah Rastafari
Who is seated in zion and reigneth in the hearts of
In the hearts of all flesh whoi

[Verse 1: Method Man]
I ain't trying to be no D-boy, I love music, I'm a b-boy
Are you the undercover or the decoy
I'm heavy with the D, Trouble T Roy
A pit with no muzzle about to bust your bubble like a keloid
Too much marijuana got me p-noid
I'm killing instrumentals with that All So Simple Can It Be, boy
Shout to Lil Cease, B.I.G., boy
And Funk Doctor Spock, I mean Redman that's not Leonard Nimoy
88 keys on the keyboard
I'm down to catch wreck, take them first three letters out of record
It's Meth, you heard it through the wire I could be more
Or washed up like Sonny Black's body on the seashore
That's a problem, I could be yours
A monster without the mad scientist and Igor
I've heard it before, a third of these boys
Got murder raps and never even murdered before
[Hook: Nathaniel]
Keep watch, lights out when the beat drop
Keeping the streets locked
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
Keep watch, lame niggas out there can kick rocks
Run these streets out here don't need cops
I'm calling all G's from each block, from each block
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Codename Sensei, I live what my pen say
Game hall of fame, flow is MJ
, 
Muy caliente
Je m'appelle Rebel, capisce, comprende?
Son I'm touching 'em up, trust I'm like
Justin Tuck how they ducking the rush
Tryna Break Bad, you catch a bad break
Like I own a 
 how I stack cakes
Greatness was nothing, Deck the next Nike ad
Wifey bad and my life got 'em slightly mad
Cause I shine like chrome in July
Soldier I opened your eyes, notice the lies
DEA say I'm drugging 'em
I get you leaning hard, I get the fiends to nod, I mean they loving 'em
All hail your highness,
 terrific win
Put a so-called beast in his place, Pacific Rim
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
Foul ass police, crooked ass friends
I don't give a fuck yo, the drama never ends
I'm a project nigga, I don't care about the Benz
Plus I had a lot of chicks, you can have those bitches
But I murder your bloodclot if you touch my riches
Yeah crazy ass skipper, I be in the slums, nigga
Fuck where I come from 
I'm a quiet gangster nigga
First I get you comfortable, then I start shanking niggas
 code is don't violate the family
 it's no snakes in the amnesty
I come through wilding on some Wu-Tang 'Can It Be'
Googly-eyed nigga
, 
chop his face in the ministry
Never scared to do the time, fuck the penitentiary
Leave a bunch of dead niggas,
 
don't forget to mention me
The angel of rap, the un-ordinary light
Already did what I was gonna do before you even got the mic
[Verse 4: GZA]
We left a large solar cloud distinguished by size
Interaction with the wise and civilized
The mind caused matter to fall into a center
A great deal of heat that'll radiate within ya
From out of this collision
The central cord became thick enough to trap its own light and bring vision
Each drop full of Hip Hop energy
Balanced on all sides such great symmetry
The bars unlocked the power of the stars
The mirror in the telescope pinpoint the Gods
From a distance, acting as a guiding coach
Analyze the board, universal approach
Retune the soul to a certain pitch
Changing the frequency frequently, hitting a certain switch
The love is paramount, the connect is brotherly
Respect for the intellect and broad discovery
[Hook]

[Rae]
Yo Meth, hold up, hold up

[Rae]
Fucking corn

YoyoyoyoyoYO! Yo
Is the niggas ready for this son?
Niggas ain't ready for this ock
One two whatcha wanna do (I'm gonna give it to em anyway though man)
Peep the Inspectah Deck (You know they ain't ready for it)
Lyrical threat
Representing Wu-Tang
Slang, ninety-five
Hittin it live
You know what time it is
Blessed with the art rhymes that's sharp like a circular saw
Hit the floor like Dorf, who wants the war
Then slide by my, lyrical driveby
Chops rush, making black hearts bust, plus knifes they got
When they rush, built like construction tools
Crushing fools, in twos
Forced dude to blast you out your fuckin shoes
A South swap with the bombs I drop
Plan A to terrorize you can't stop the plot
Execution of an amateur, who dared to challenge the
Clansman, holding a sword like Excalibur
Truth is my shield, show and prove I reveal
Reality, a coldness the heart can feel
Livin life where caps peel, and crack deals from nine to five
But I survived in these hard times I nearly died
Now I'm wanted by death I did escape
Now it's thrown on a tape with those who can relate
Still I wrap my face take a space in the staircase
Hits takin place, yo God, watch the Jakes
Out of state court dates, chase me with the warrants
For my insurance, switched names to Michael Lawrence
The Rebel, stomps through the slums I'm from
Coming through with nuff niggas, and nuff guns to bust son
So read the article, lyrical assassin with the arsenal
Potential witnesses are incapable
Of testifying, I won't be frying in the chair
Plus the case closed, I won't be ever shackled, and safe clothes
I make foes, exasperates then, I 
make friends
Cause today's friends, show theyselves as snakes in the end
And if you fit the trend then Protect Ya Nec
k
Shaolin, INS, Killa Hill Projects
No one on this earth, can hold me
No one on this earth, can fool me
No one on this earth, can grip the mic
Like, I, do, nigga
You ever, feel, that you can
Test me, you got to face the Clan and
Never, return to the mic again
There's no one in the world
Let me at them! I blast off lyrics like a Magnum
Forty-four caliber, bustin mad holes in my challenger
Tongue in your throat is swiss cheese
The wild freestyler, wild like Gene Wilder
Wu-Tang killa bee aimed at your brain
With my stinger, it stun your mind, when I bring ya
Thirty-six chambers of anger, frustration
For waiting, to let loose on the nation
Far from commercial no need for no rehearsal
Hit you from all angles then form a circle
Go against the grain within close range
When I Slam, like Onyx, come get some, that's a promise
I'll represent, here's the evidence
Science of mad murder plates I make sense
My technique of speech is deep, like Leviathan
Hittin up your block with rhymes, like a firing
Shooting for the platinum, then bring it back to
The same place I got the gat from, let me at them!

[Intro Skit]
Someday I'm gonna be walkin down the streets
Mindin my own business.. and BAM!!
I'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna SWEAR
That it was a mistake
I accept that as a part of my destiny!
{*
Si es mi destino morir en la calle como un perro

Whattup kid? That's right..
Yo.. aiyyo.. aiyyo..
[Hook: Raekwon]
Aiyyo let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo
Let my niggas live
We real niggas that's God-body, challenge anything, make major moves
Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron,
 no pryin rules
Let my niggas live; aiyyo let my niggas live
Handle your bid and kill no kids
[Raekwon the Chef]
Millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
Got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
Kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
Yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
That's that fire move like Schwinns yo
Invisible pens that write light, leave blends
Hit with the JF Kennedy shot
Smash with the Acapulco rifle got got
Bolt off, but got clocked
Legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
Design your alphabet, reps get graded
We in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
Home of Allah's ten big rooms
So what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
Exotic Gods bust my hammer at frauds
Call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
Gucci jumper X-5, gettin more head
[Hook]
[Nas]
I scream at the mirror, curse, askin God, "Why me?"
Run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
I'm God-son, son of man, son of Marcus Garvey
Rastafari irie, Ha-ile Selassie
Police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
It takes more than metal bars
, we destined for ours
I hear murder plans from dopefiends,
 
with elephant hands
Snots in they nostril,
 
the blocks is hostile
There's no pots to piss in, Glocks is spittin
Rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
Drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
It drove lots of men to die with no name
I been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga
[Hook]
[Inspectah Deck]
Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C.O. flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas Glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a 
New York state of mind
, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors
[Hook]

[Intro: Method Man] + (Raekwon)
(Yeah, yeah) Aiyo, how much more for a fifth of Vodka? (Peace beloved)
(Six bottles of Henny, six bottles of Henn) Word, word, let me get that
Herb, yeah, yeah.. (bring that bucket here)

[
Hook 2X: Freda Payne sample

I've gone through life pretending
That time will change the ending
[Method Man]
Peace to the God (peace God) pour out a little liquor
Shame On A Nigga
, I heard the reaper done came to get ya
So I done copped a fifth of, Vodka, and in your honor
I've grown this fetish for loose ladies and baby mommas
Some say it's bad karma, what you do, man, it come back on ya
Music got us up off them crack corners
Now I'mma swallow this whole bottle for Ol' Dirty
Damn, it hurts me, I hate it when brothers go early
[Hook 2X]
[Raekwon]
Word to my son, he gon' remember you, rubbing on a statue
In his lab, that resemble you, and what it meant to Wu
Us forming like a family, you just blew
You was the chess piece on the board, that made us look true
Watching your pen swish, you love frying kingfish
You the pearl in the ocean, I'm up on the land, pissed
Now you moving more prestigious
, 
me, hitting this reefer
I know it's real, 
guess I slept with the Black Jesus
[Hook 2X]
[GZA]
I became weak when I heard, that his body expired
It was hard for me to believe my brother retired
Suddenly the clock stopped and the room started spinning
How can he walk off the field during the first inning?
I cried like a baby on the way to his place of death
Hate not being there, the minutes before he left
Now I'm in the booth, ten feet from where he lay dead
I think about him on this song and what he might've said
[Hook 2X]
[Masta Killa]
When I first heard the word, I needed air to clear my head
I know you didn't say what I thought you said, my brother's dead
You crazy, another Dirty prank to get the family cranked
Ya'll niggas shouldn't play like that
, I know how you feel
Lord, but it's real, and I still can't believe
And my heart still grieves the loss, there's no pretending
Ason Unique
, loved wine and fine women
We singing on tour, "
ooh baby, we like it raw
"
[Hook 2X]
[Interlude: Inspectah Deck - over hook]
Can't pretend...
Some day it gotta come to an end
But I'mma keep you right here dog, real close to my heart
Yeah...
[Inspectah Deck]
I popped a bottle on your born day, God
Tried hard not to cry, I still can't hide the scar
And I still ask, why to God
, 
analyzing your form
As I stood there beside your mom
And I share the blame, cuz you was calling for help, kid
Should've, would've, could've, had the time, I was selfish
I carry on your struggle, each day it really hurts me
I really miss you Russell, hope you forgive me Dirty
[Hook 2X]
[U-God]
Yo, these walls I wanna crash, and put my fists through
Shout out to Dirty, let the whole world miss you
Reach out and kiss you in your coffin, my heart races
I dropped tears and watch my nigga fall from greatness
It's all wasted, flushed down the drain
 and
Soon as the news hit me, I bust out with pain
 and
Rivers I cried, my brother just died
I'mma see you, my nigga, on the other side
[Hook 2X]
[RZA]
Ah, man, how do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
It's hard to live without you, God, 
I shouldn't have doubted you
When you said that The Passion of Christ was all about you
From the God Mobile
, to Linden Plaza, to Brownsville
Florida to Ohio, to Putnam, to Park Hill
You interrupt the Grammy's said "Wu for the kids"
Took four or five shots when they rushed in the crib
Trey-five-seven cracked ya ribs,
 
cops shot ya whip
You've been chased by the pigs,
 
sold the four year bid
Crashed cars, still came out without a scar
They tried to keep ya free spirit trapped in a jar
So you'll keep ya mouth shut, and not tell the world
Who's who and what's what, and probably go nuts
How we treat them hoes? Dirt, how we treat them hoes?
We fuck 'em in the butt, Dirt
[Hook]

But those mistakes behind me
Cast shadows to remind me

[Intro: Tyrese Rose]
Yeah, the fuckin' Wu-Tang Clan
With the, with the, with the friggin' uh
The friggin' dope artists man
Friggin' uh, Ghostface, Inspectah Deck
And me, Tyrese Rose, always just gotta rip shit up
So fuck y'all motherfuckers
[Verse 1: Tyrese Rose]
Yo, I'm not a thug so I sit back to see how people act
Some niggas rap, some niggas don't, but they packin' gats
For niggas, bitches and cops, they bust shots with Glocks
They don't stop, until they see that every motherfucker drop
Some people I knew, they dead on the floor
'Cuz they got AIDS, 'cuz they was gettin' head from a whore
Some of the girls are gettin' blackmailed to stay with a guy
Like Brianna, 'cuz they sent naked pics, not a lie
By the way, I only said it 'cuz you just put me out
You said I got lame rhymes, don't open your mouth
Next time,
 
anyways back to the topic,
 
don't talk shit
Or else you gotta deal with their Glock bitch
Back then I wasn't insane, now I'm fuckin' deranged
'Cuz I'm lovin' this pain,
 
but my cousin's in my dang-er
Yo, Scoe stay strong, them niggas can't fade ya
Life will be always the same cuh
Thankful for Leo, DaiDai, Adrian and CJ
'Cuz they got my back every single day
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Fleeing the crime scene speeding
Beefing leaving behind cream, not even peeping that I was leaking
Won't see the precinct just got a recent case beaten
Still jakes are creeping, don't blow your spot, stay the weekend
Keep the Ruger peeling who's squealing few knew the dealings
Keep the steel concealed in cause we got no time for feelings
Eyes on the building guards are on the corners illing
Million dollar block villain plotting on a killing
Feel like, a superhero talking like a true Deniro
They boost his ego path and broke down, reduced to zero
Cops fill reports hoping I'll reveal my source, source
[Sample]
That splash against my hollow bones
That rocks my soul
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Outside the check cashing, flashing, dipped in fashion
Five cherry-faced faggots tried to cash in
They keep laughing – Ghost, you'll get your face bashed in
Who gave you these privileges son? Why you maxing?
And we... fiending to take those
Move slow, I'm hearing how you broke Rob's nose
And I heard you keep a banging hammer, golden brass
Diamonds embroideries that was stolen that you haven't reported, G
Make very little noise, my shit hiccup
Don't make this big stick up big up me and the boys
I thought for a second then chose rather than froze
Had the Gem Star in my hand... yo, what the fuck?
Yo, that's when I ripped Timothy, snatched and dipped
Jumped right in back of him, had the mini axe tool, faxed him
Shots rang off, bing-boggle-de-dum
[Sample]
That splash against my hollow bones
[Movie Sample]
The sword, it's the best weapon of all
Two sharp edges, and a long spine
The blade is very thin and it's easily damaged
You remember that: the vital thing is the point
Pay special attention to it, your life could depend on it

    
  [Raekwon] Yo, you know what I mean? Chillin within

"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility"
[Raekwon] That's comin from Louis Rich
[Raekwon] Baggin, you know what time it is, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Put them cracks down you just started slanging two months ago
What up with Larry Francisco tell him to let that bitch go
Why you standing there? Posing you like Donna Karan wear
Nigga save that, the same shit you had it last year
You be running with them outsiders
That shit is fucked up yo, we never turn to dick riders
Your Mac is big, got a little grip, yo
You think that shit gon live what he did -- what this nigga said
Remember when his mans got there, the whole shit was set up
Shut up, whole fam want the science and the letter
It got back to me some niggas in Medina askin me
"You know some niggas in the gold E-Class," splash to me
Yo that shit you had in Vegas
Yo, it could have got us both sprayed up
They seen the Ac, noticed Jada
Hair salon, 
treating shorty like Quran
Her fam major swing kingpins you won't dare front on
Octavia with all the ice on, yo
She own a car wash now, 
her little Keon doing triple life
Marry a Son who got baked, it coulda been
For a half a cake, play the shank, maybe bite her
Shit is fucked up when they got us yo
She fainted at her baby wake now watch the breakdown
"..face responsibility"
She fainted at her baby wake now yo watch the breakdown
"Little ghetto boy, playing in the ghetto street"
[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
Yo all of y'all niggas got the whole story wrong
Talk what you talk but twist the real song
When it comes down to this, not a licensed driver
Show y'all niggas whose style is more liver
This is not a act this is more actual fact
Nothing but experience placed upon track
With the true sound, not lying out the crown
When we not working we hardly be around
Yeah see the light, right now we could fight
You not a real brother you just a fake type
That get on the mic then throw your cliché
Half the East coast sounding just like Rae
If you a Gambino, give credit to the flow
If you not a part of this kid act like you know
Fuck the studio, Cappaccino the great
Fly cherry head niggas like planes out of state
I ain't friends with you, only my CD hit you
If you want some then stop fronting is the issue
It's my turn, live niggas could pass
Two-faced rappers push they shit last
Straight off the edge into the rubbish
Peep my new style fuck Cristal and Moet
I drink Evian water while my darts get published
"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"
"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up..."
"What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"
"Little ghetto boy, playin in the ghetto streets
What you gonna do when you grow up, and have to face responsibility?"
{*35 seconds of instrumental pass until the martial arts samples*}
One is invulnerable, in fact
It involves strenuous breath control
Out of all techniques, it's the most difficult
The human body has a hundred and eight pressure points
Thirty-six of these can be fatal
The remainder, paralyzing

[Skit: Method Man and Raekwon]
[Meth] Yeahhh, torture motherfucker what? [Torture nigga what?] What?
I'll fuckin - I'll fuckin tie you to a fuckin bedpost with your ass cheeks spread out and shit, right, put a hanger on a fuckin stove and let that shit sit there for like a half hour, take it off and stick it in your ass slow like *Tssssssss*

If a million sons would stand as one

The whole world trippin', listen it's still a cold world
The other day I had to bury my homegirl
Wrong place, caught one in her face
Plus her man's on the run and couldn't come to the wake
For Heaven's sake, you pray God open the gate
In this modern day Sodom, that's their only escape
10 year olds are cold, no, they don't hesitate
2 up a G pack, he chose the whole 8
Catch a 5 to 10 sellin' 5's and 10's
And the police informer was your childhood friend
In the real world, gotta hustle for your dream
Extend your clips, fit the muzzle with the beam
For the love of cream, it's nothin' but routine
Swing on the judge, take a couple for the team
He's the young Capone, he grew up in a drug home
Stranded on the Ave with a blunt and his gun shown

A live scene theme from a 
 saga
A Martin Scorsese classic and I'm the author
Drama at the opera, 
crime story novel
Tuxedo suit and silencer on the nozzle
Meeting place scheduled at the Broadway musical
Bravo, we arrive in bulletproof limo
Shotgun, the underboss of our main source
Of interest, 
the black widow cocaine empress
A princess rich from her family's inheritance
Now let's talk business, begin by addressin' the bricks
That was missin' in the last shipment
At first, everything nice, everything routine
Jocks lining up the food, we blessed him with the cream
But on this day he wasn't ready and my God sense keen
I noticed that his normal firm handshake shook
It wasn't steady when he squeezed
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Raekwon]
He went from prince to a king out of a life of rubbish
Wearin' tailor-made suits, Sky Dwellers and clusters
To perfection, rags to riches, the evil's done influenced
That pushed him off the edge, they said the greed made him do it
You're my right hand, damn, he fucked the trust up
It's ruined, niggas caught him slidin' on his belly
I'm grippin' on my hammer with the silencer twisted
Contemplatin' murder now, I'm 'bout to swerve on my biscuit
But it's my man at the same time, I don't wanna do him
He violated, broke a major code, bar what you stealin' now
It's over, in the falls of Niagara, he was soakin'
With a shell case stuck in his head, they found him floatin'
[Hook] x2
[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
Allah let me lay in your arms
Hold me like a newborn, sing to me the most sweetest song
The exalted, the most benevolent
The knower of all, keep me safe 'till I return back to your residence
This Earth, my place of birth
As time went through the ages it got worse
Sicknesses, beheadings in Syria
Ebola's killin' my people, it's gettin' scarier
Most foods ain't even real, the chip is here
Deadly fluids bein' released, contracted through air
Dear God, it's been a minute since I cried out
Since mama died, I never wild out
We need help like the phone's 'bout to die out
Can you hear me? Can you hear me now?
We need a miracle
Destroy the FDA for holdin' back cures so they can get paid

Still a predicate, doin' time, tell 'em that's a negative
Prejudice judge, bails be a mil' in cash
Scorin' money like the meter on the Yellow Cab
Give the witness an unexpected visit
Make his story change like walls blockin' his vision
Couldn't give a clear description, fearin' the repercussions
Like, "I was on the ground, I ain't see him bustin'"
Now the DA chasin' a plea, they hatin' I'm free
The case is mistaken identity
[Verse 2: Method Man]
Whoever push me like Pusha T, I push back
I push a cap, before '93, I pushed crack
I'm hood, black, you know me well, what's good Scrap?
I'm smokin' rappers, you are a L, what's good Smack?
Hold up that's goods rap, pardon self
I just like good rap, but when I see goods I give his goods back
I rap for riders that pack strap to rhymers that backpack
To 25 to lifers that jack MAC
We movin' ratchets, no Kat Stacks, it's magic
The way we flip the package before the coppers can catch it
I'm past that chapter in life, let's live it lavish
When life take a piss in your bed, you flip the mattress
Before you try and get my head, get you some Pampers
Then take a long look at my ish and get your answers
Kick in my vicinity, I'm what rappers pretend to be
Charge 'em with a penalty, mistaken identity
[Hook: Streetlife]
 (x2)
Mistaken identity, you highly mistaken me
Check my ID, Wu-Tang, that's the legacy
[Verse 3: U-God]
Fresh off of work, he jumped out the van
Two suitcases, dangle on his hands
He opened up the door, headed up the stairs
Thought he heard a noise, but no one else was there
First sight he saw, struck him by surprise
Two shots was given, between his girl's eyes
Windows blown out, no prints on the door
All he seen was blood stains, smear the damn floor
911, ambulance showed up
Blood everywhere, paramedics throwin' up
Cops cuffed him up, hit him with the charge
But he was bangin' Mrs. Prixy at the Motor Lodge
He got his alibis, gonna use 'em all
The screw fit the judge, he might take the fall
Someone set him up, a botched robbery
Mistaken identity, yeah it gotta be
[Verse 4: Cappadonna]
17 years old, I'm headed back to the hole
Mistaken identity, every way was sold
I look like a hoodlum, I rock a lot of gold
They lockin' everybody up, ship your ass up the road
I ain't have a 9 on me, they was lyin' on me
Court day with my old bird, they was spyin' on me
Tried to set me up, plantin' coke in my pocket
The beast pat me up, they won't let me off
[Verse 5: Masta Killa]
Na-n-n-n-n-n-n-nah it wasn't me
It could never been the G-O-D, not me
You terribly mistaken, son, I ain't the one
We could never look nothin' like, whether near or far sight
What resemblance does he strike? So my mic Fahrenheit
W for my a-alike, your DNA match tight
Even if they bite us, close but not quite
They still tryna get it right, mistaken identity
[Hook:] x4 + [Instrumental] + [Hook:] x4

[Interlude]
Brother, I think that necklace is causing you too much trouble
[Verse 1: Cappadonna]
My necklace had the whole crowd on some next shit
The guest list full of real niggas that's hectic
The charm piece made my niggas move like calm beasts
Palm beats, two jostling niggas with long reach
Keep your eyes open for them strong on thieves
Out here looking for ice to put in they teeth
Chain glowing shining and I'm ready for beef
Like my nigga 2 Chainz, cappuccino from the east
From the Wu-Tang Clan, my necklace and my heat
Bang bang, 
different robe every day of the week
2 Angels
, 
dinner plate
, 
fat dollar sign
Universal flag on, nigga, I got shine
[Interlude]
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
I keep my neck frozen, .45 loaded, please don't approach this
Rope is so ferocious
, 
diamonds that shine in oceans
Keep you arm distant from my carats, silly rabbits
Make me get my barrel, spazzed out and cause havoc
Iced out Cubans,
 
exotic stones from Africa
This the real thing, big bling, the chain swing
Try to swipe mines, that's a no no, the God's loco
Jewelry truckin' fancy spend stacks upon Delancey
Exhaust pipes coughing horse kicks
ACP's dress up the flesh, now the crime scene's gorgeous
My links is unbreakable, told y'all on the Purple Tape
40 inches hang from my neck, nigga, I'm wealthy
[Interlude]
[Break during Interlude: Ghostface Killah]
Why you say that?
It's real, kill a nigga for this shit
Aha, yo relax sis
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Dinner plates rings
, 
smothered in 2 pounds of dope
Eric B on the cut when it blings
Scrubbin' chain down in Colgate
, double edged bangers
On they hips I wait in the jaw break
The snakes and the violators, Dracula style takers
We got a bunch of gold balls, but we ain't the Lakers
Hey bitches, stay lickin' my necklace
And I ain't even put the dumb bitch in the guest list
That's what you get when you throwin' on Cuban's
Drawers that's made from silk, a robe and a Ruger
Crack heads catchin' a sweet vix on a scooter
Catch me for my chain, it belongs on a shooter
Lucky my shit blow like a horn on a tuba
You might as well do me now cause I will do ya
[Interlude]
[Verse 4: GZA]
God-Cipher-Love-Divine in math 79
Bright yellow and dense in its gift and shine
Still the same when exposed to air and water
Like when amongst thieves you  travellin' across the border
The brink of the metal link when in transition remains solid
The message was lost in transmission
That's often in a free elemental form
Nuggets and grains and rocks and things that's norm
Malleable ductile metal on many levels
Get you shot for a Flintstone, killed for a pebble
Lieutenants and Generals move with criminals
The pride for all in line, they hunt for mineral
The scope is on the rope, claws on the table
Brass knuckle, knees buckle, legs unstable
And it's sold by the weight
Shaped into a plate with food on it
The hungry wolves lie and wait
[Interlude]
[Outro skit]
Tu Tin-To. So you're the tigers of Tinan, bastard, you're gonna pay for this, you'll die here. I'll use the tiger strike to kill you all. I'll show you the three different strokes. Forest Tiger! Win Tiger, Winmau Tiger!

[Sample: Martin Luther King]
I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. Five score years ago, a great American in whose symbolic shadow we stand today
[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
Look, homicide is illegal, death is a penalty
Never let go when you've got ahold of your enemy
Eagle claw cobra clutch by any means necessary
I’ll never let it go, see my shadow ninja mic flow
I throw a great entre dart arrow to your temple
Allmighty [?]  to the insidious
Plan of the Wu-Tang Clan became a world brand
We never let it go, we talk a half a mil a show
[Verse 2: GZA]
Never let go of your mind
It’s a terrible thing to waste
To lose, but it’s very hard to find
Being that ignorance is lethal
We must touch hearts, tune souls, harmonize the people
Never let go of your plan, execute
So when you shoot, inspire everyone on the land
Never lose knowledge of yourself
For it may become risk to your health
And great loss of wealth
[Verse 3: Method Man]
Never let go of your cream, never let go of your dream
Players retire, but they never let go of the team
If you a rider then you never let go of that thing
Pull up your mans’ like you better let go of that bling
This life’s crazy, too many life sentences, maybe
Fatherless babies on the block but they father 380
That’s just the hood lately, never let go
I’m what the hood made me
Momma told me to find a good lady
[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
Never let go of staring at the death
Like yo, that's your best blow
I still hold on like En Vogue
The cold go to war with the heat
Eyes wide, never falling asleep
All the talking is cheap
Call'em, 
ultimate warrior, W.W.F
I come up victorious, struggle is nothing to Deck
Set it straight for the seeds, to see a better new
Take the real life by the rings and I ain’t letting go
I ain’t letting go
[Chorus]
No matter what the odds be
No matter how hard we
You never let go
[Verse 5: U-God]
Never let go of the fight, never let go of the mic
My honesty, my values, my loyalty, my pride
And memory of those who have passed to the other side
Never letting go, I’m never letting go of my beliefs
My faith, convictions, real
Both hands holding on, never let go the wheel
We hood legends, misunderstood
These lessons, learned
Growing up for manhood
Keep focus on the prize what you better do
A little taste of heaven, sunshine is where we headed to
States what’s ahead of you, always on the schedule
Smoke the gold leaf down to the residue
Letting go, is something that I never do
Those who let go, live life regrettable
Never let go of your hope or your rope
Eyes on the prize, never let go of the scope
When I’m in jail, never let go of the soap
Hold on, boy, never let go
[Verse 6: RZA]
Never let go, the all-eye-seeing, the supreme
Never let go the love of your seeds, or your queen
Never let go your heart, or the place you started
The feeling that I had, Wu-Tang had just charted
The old earth departed, I give thanks to the martyrs
I never let go the love I have for thy father
Never let go the glow
The more I know the more that it shows
I won’t let go, even if I decompose
Your seed will carry it on, we need to carry it on
Pass the baton, life is just the marathon
And ain't' playing to win it, it’s an epidemic
Never let go, that’s what the god recommended
[Chorus]
[Sample: Martin Luther King]
And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges. Who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice. For many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny. And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom

[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Aiyo I roll like a Bat Out of Hell
, 
evil acapell's fly
Spitting out of my grill before I hit the sky
With springtime colors, juicy as a Sunkist
Certain broads double Dutch this, they carve it in they wrist
Pillsbury blazes, 
straightening combs left on the stove
Crumbs in my lady hair, 
plus yours, the look gold
God, the old chain and ball technique, 
got these
Vegetable lasagne niggas in they whips, jumping out they seats
18 Bronzeman Part II
We like Dorothy Hamill on ice, we in your hood we might circle
Hats down low in the
 
Range
, 
switch lanes Change my tire, peel out, real loud on the stage yo
I shitted on your hood kid
, 
I shitted on your hood
Got to your burner too late, I'm looking real good
Draped out, 
shining like a fresh fifty cent piece
"Yo girlfriend, come here, oh shit, you my man's niece"
The gourmet pocket twenty, bombs made of clay
Sexcapades take place, we fucking forty eight shades
Might walk up in your studio
, 
time slap your engineer
Lighter fluid to
 
DAT
 style, hand me the matches now
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Aiyo rainbow Roley on the wrist
, 
now what's this
Niggas bless this
, eight and a half, Bally banana twist
E shakes
, 
puffing on lye
, 
feeding the seed's plate
Pulling out old .38s to rob gates
Major wake up, the kid tell tales, make a nigga head wake up
Beats break, the nigga whipped, take off his time
Honolulu status, gladdest, 
the rich rock cabbage
And dollar vans grands
, that nigga mad savage
Stationary Hall of Justice, niggas came clumped out
Just came home, now they bunked out
Money be longer than triple life
, 
till the Sun burn out
That's my word, move it with the burner out
Fidel way of thinking, 
roll with the Mac bent Ac-10
Most of my team, Five Percent
Check what the live said, rolling with Guess vests pedestrians
Yo, holding my nuts, 
fucking thousand dollar lesbians
[Hook: Ghostface Killah and Raekwon]
Ghost:
Yo, the Older God put me on and had to rock this
Both: 
Maintain 360 Lord live prosperous
Ghost: 
It only takes a lesson a day
, just to analyze life
Both: one time in the respectable mind
(repeat 2X)
[Verse 3: GZA]
Let the shot spark, soon as his pit bull barks
Tire scars from skid marks leaves from jams in school parks
Witness forget his original statement
Even in protection programs there's no escapement
Gunned down, three in town hit king from 
seven crowns
Spent rounds, catch him while he rhyme in the Zebra Lounge
Wounded, back in the '83 summer heat
Up in 3-0-9 park, 
rhyming off the drummer's beat
I stalk the city streets demonstrating mic wrecks
All looking stank, I ain't playing with a full deck
And as they nervously stare, I know they scared
They saw the coming of Wu in neon in Times Square
Household name assassin, 
Killa Bee
Mill to the grain that posess the Wu trilogy
Quick to spot those that bite camoflouge and blend
Those that got styles, they got identical twins
Don't stretch the small thing, copycats are finicky
Without skills, they master the art of mimicry
But I go line for line on the whole page
Your unspotted life on the mic is old age
{*rocket fired, whistles off and explodes, breaking glass*}

I saw niggas cough up blood when they hiccup
Hole in their stomach comin' back from a stick up
If you don't make it you can keep your half of the bread
I'm not playin' with you bruh, you halfway dead
If it was me, you'd probably say the same shit
Crack the drugs probably wouldn't get a rag to cover my shit
I'm just bein' honest Lord
It's $400,000 for the four of us
What's up with ya'lls
Damn Tone leave em alone
Shut the fuck up be quiet before I go in your bag
Then I'm gonna come up
You know how I do I get busy
If you can get through this near death shit I throw 'em the extra 50

Modern vampires of the city, hunting blood
Blooood, blood, bloooood.. blooood
You coulda from Rema, or ya come from Jungle
You coulda come from Fire House or
You come from Tower Hill
One bloood, one bloood, one bloood
[Masta Killa]
I was rollin, showin my age, unshaven
Rugged with my Timberland boots that paid
I walk with a slight lean from the weight of my heat
Givin a green to shine infra-red beam
At the street traffic light recorders
Takin pictures of our corners
Cameras on the side of the buildings, we destroy 'em
The Chameleon throws cream to children, out the window
We movin in unmarked vans, disguised as a light tan
With plastic faces and rubber hands
Fuck fame, I shoot a hole in a 50 cent piece to test my aim
How dare you call the Gods in vain
Not knowin the seriousness of this and why I came
To Earth, feet first
I dare you lion tame to the beat of the drum
No questionin to the session, I walk with gun
The magnum'll bust his head from many directions unknown
Another statistic
, 
change the ballistics
On the nozzle, make em goggle and swallow
Scrape the craters of the brain for data
Old scriptures on withered paper
Beginnin take shape and form
When the Gods get on it and crash your college dorm
[Junior Reid]
You coulda come from uptown, or you come from downtown
You coulda come from outta town, or you come from 'round town
One bloood, one blooood, one blooooood
The fussing and fighting
The tribal war, racial war
Cause bloooood, blooood
[Masta Killa]
Now verse 2, even more deadly than the first, unrehearsed raw footage
Part 2 for you, I give this dedication, project elimination
Here's a burnt offering, nothing up my sleeve
I'm just vanishin with the vanishin cream
Here's jewels to live by
Identify before you enter and can't leave with weed
Fuck that, we waste no time in search of those who can't breathe
A bomb only has one time to explode
When I break I'm takin everything
Turn the city streets to Dusty Rhodes
Behold this return of the Invincible Tone
Rude like Governor Tuse and King Toustume
Who gave the order to bust 'em?
Don't ask this is Genuine Draft
Blueprint ultimate legit 
sting international, stone love classical
Comin back, to attack in black fatigue

You coulda come from Lebanon, or ya come from Iran
You da both from China, ah ya both from Japan

You da both from An-ah-town, ah ya both from long (??)
One bloood, one blooood, one blooood
The pussy 'nit find it
Travel w'on, raise your wine
That's bloood, yuud, blooood, bloood
Mothers fighting daughters every day
Fathers fighting sons
Sisters hating sisters
Rappers getting murdered, every day
You two da both from Eeh-hee-ma, ah ya both a Juhnker
You da both from fire outside
Ya both a (??)
One bloood, one blooood, one bloooood
You two da from da Brook-a-lyn, ah ya both from Jonx

One of these days and you won't be long
[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I'm from the home where the buffalo roam
And niggas don't give a flyin' fuck
Talk with signs up, 
walk with the iron tucked
Leave your eyes wide shut
Money bag's on the table, gots to get my cut
Rebel I city slicker
, 
pick up a pretty sister
Dig her out on the table, bent off the Rémy liquor
Head splitter, deliver so cold I send shivers
From many figures, battle the world or any nigga
I'm uptown saturday night like Bill Cos'
Got weed in the jars with 
vanilla cigars
On the strip, eyeballin' the chicks, all in the mix
Gassed off of my shit, vibratin' the whip
[Hook] x2
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Yo I'm sicker than the V12 X5
With cracks in the Rolly jumper all we do is Drink fuckin' Drive
Real niggas raise up, Mommy get your feet off the table
The cable luck bare, my man got me one on his leckle
It's nothin' for me to get up with you, guts with you
Blow off them matches and sit up with you
Aiyo the streets, what is gettin' more crazy?
Stressin' me nothin', investin' the leathers, we all into things blazin'
Slingin' coke is just a normal habit
, rappers we wear
Straddlers with cannons and hatchets gettin' cheers
Yatzis are fresh off the block, block squeezin', it's real
If we get real, put pop, poppin' at your blocks equal
Take these niggas and throw 'em in lakes, it's business
Rake these niggas on the mic, display your ninjas
Nines crowns verses your nine towns
Run up with nine 9's, brown down, get to lyin' you down
[Hook] x2
[Verse 3: U-God]
I come from the slums, I ain't no dummy
My testiment talk, represent money
This Verbal Intercourse
, 
fueled by exhaust
The bread winner, head spinner, coldest with the force
No remorse, endorse the rap artist
So flamboyant cos I pimp slap the hardest
Ever since the triumph we've been missin' them soldiers
We came tonight, boy the mission is cobra, full exploder
Bulldose through the rubbish, I'm in too deep boy
I just gotta love this, they call we too sweet
One of the nine brothers, I'm so unique
Every line that smother, the situation's grim
It's bloody sin cos every time I want out they pull me back in
I see my reflection in the chrome mac 10
Ask the passer who's faster with the pen
Then pull it, nine hollows, amorettos
That's how I like it, sweat on my wine bottles
The automobiles with them shiny assed hubs
The endo pull, with the bathtub club, my angel's in the mud
Veteran smile, that's gangsta shit, that American style
Dig it, prick or prey
I'm quick to slay with the rectifier shit, caught by the ricochet nigga

Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
Enter the Wu-Tang zone
[Verse 1: RZA]
We don't hunt deer
Vegetarian dishes from the concierge
Presidential suites, presidential treats
Brazilian models, oilin' up my feet
10 days a month, my girl pays for lunch
3 days a week, we work out at Crunch
Time after time, line after line
Our stock increases, rhyme after rhyme
In the valley, of San Fernando
Found Q-Tip's wallet in El Segundo
Prolly been spotted on Telemundo
With more wild cards than a box of Uno
That spin like propeller, my dog like Old Yeller
Holler at the moon, my goons at Coachella
[Refrain]
[Verse 2: U-God]
I got my hands in the pot, 500 grand in the yacht
I'm the dope man with plans to expand on every block
Wu-brand, legendary hands, hard as penitentiary rock
Now put that to your temple, the Wu symbol's 'bout to drop
Insert the beam on my Glock, got that lean in my bottle
What that mean? High self esteem, straight cream on the top
Ridin' chops similar to UFC kickbox, kick rocks
Dirty trucker pit stops, shit, grams in a Ziploc
Watch how the pitbull lock his jaws, then lock your doors
Feds watch the boards, hip hop spills out my pores
I be raw, 4 plus 4, but 7 more
The Clan rock the tours, we be them reservoir dogs
[Hook: RZA]
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier
Pioneer the frontier

[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Guaranteed I bang hard
I plan to leave the game large, no brainwash
The devil himself could not persuade God,
 my blade's sharp
Circle my square, I dare you Braveheart
Before I leave your head in your hands, what's your name, huh?
My lines get in your cells like 7 Ls
Any problem, I address you like I'm sendin' you mail
Let me do well, they'd rather see me dead or in jail
But let it be my life story if they ever do tell
Know I died for what I live
An intimate connection for that infinite reflection
That's my wife and my kids, there's a price on my lid
So now my stock's high and shots fired
My niggas who was tight with the kid
I'm hot as Hell's Kitchen with the oven on
Deck bomb, teflon the rappers nothin' to a don
If I'm frontin' then respond
If not, throw up your arms, it's the Killer Bee swarm
And your set, the fuck is y'all?
[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
You enterin' the 36, masterin' the 18
[?] chamber sixth, hands down, I crush bricks
Backs that'll break bats, this is what y'all wanted back
Classic Wu RZA track with mathematic actual facts
That weigh heavy, the universal strikin' attack
Dance the drunken medley, long axe blade, machete
The shallow steppin' ninja

The only girl that could ever please me
Was the daughter of a preacher man
[Verse 1: Method Man]
Yo, pa, I got a lady, I'm 'bout to make her my baby
Might even make a baby
, the thesis makin' her crazy
She know my style wavy, I'm circlin' her Mercedes
Father, father was a preacher, I'm almost certain he hates me
But he ain't gotta date me
 and look, his baby is grown
And she decides on her own who resides on the throne
I'm her king, she my queen, we keep it right in the zone
And she understands the fact that I'm even right when I'm wrong
When she was prayin' in church, I was playin' in dirt
That's 100, I admit that we both was playin' at first
When opposites attract, I ain't always sayin' it works
I'm just sayin' ain't no use in me strayin', that make it worse
It's Wu-Tang, baby, my crew bang
And she's the preacher's daughter, I just call her my boo thang
And we tighter than shoestrings, or 10 grand in rubber bands
Man, sometimes I tell your parents just don't understand
[Verse 2: Masta Killa (RZA)]
No. yo, you mean Pastor Brown's daughter?
The preacher, the rich slave-maker of the poorer?
I used to see her Sundays comin' from church
We used to kick it at her window when her pops at work
Yo, her parents didn't play
She couldn't even come out to play on a school day
Thought she was gonna give me some on April Fool's day
(But no, no way) nah, (no, no-no, no-no, no-no way)
[Verse 3: Cappadonna]
The preacher's daughter, she an illegitimate child
She know the word, but she be runnin' in them streets foul
She married to a man, but she's crushin' his brother now
See her in the market place loud and boisterous
With tight spandex on, chokin' her oysters
She a seductress in the form of a goddess
Never virtuous or modest, poison the part is
Breakin' the vessel, turn brother against brother
Man, that's how she molest you
That's why the preacher man prolly a mess too
Cause the fruit that she devourin' is evil
Never sin around righteous people
Black widow, preacher's daughter comin' to eat you
[Hook] x4
[Verse 4: Ghostface Killah]
I met her on the bus stop with black eyes
That's why she said she don't fuck with black guys
I cleaned her up, fed her all my wisdom
Her father spit the gospel but she never caught the vision
Brutal ass whoopins, always facin' these evictions
So she only fuck with thugs that'll wind up in the system
Them greasy bastards quick to squeeze a ratchet
Never knew the science of virtue, Ecclesiastes
Like, a time for peace, a time for war
A time to laugh though, she never felt God before
Eternal love that'll pop like a kernel, this is grown folk talk
Between me and her, it don't concern you
[Hook] x4

[Woman] I'm sick doc, when can you help me?
My mind's thinkin bout shit I don't wanna think about
[Doc] Pssh.. that's yo' problem
[Hook 4X: sample *singing*]
Comfort me, you are this and that
You are this and that
[RZA]
Yo, check out yo..
I never listen to the things that my brother keeps tellin me
Hittin up thoroughly cuz my dreams are deep felony
Brothers on the beat have me high as I'm Brighton be
My legend on the verge of convertin me
Poppa be tellin me what I should be
Grand dad talks up things that I could be
Friends are finicky what I'm gonna be
When no one ever asked me, what I wanna be
A teenager house keep arresting me, big head and brothers keep testin me
I don't understand, the way my bothers lovin me
Outter world pushin me, inner world shoving me
No tape out but my friends keep provokin me
Commotion is constantly chokin me
Havin nightmares with guilt that is hurtin me
Tryin to avod this crab girl that is wantin me
Somebody help me, I've gotta be free
Of the trouble of society, I have problems
[Hook 3X]
[RZA]
Now they got me out buggin, strung out on crack
Be gettin discriminated because I'm black
My house once was a mansion but now it's a shack
My best friend talked about me, behind my back
Things would change, I thought that at first, right?
Time goes on, things got worst
Poppa now drinking, and he hit me
When I relayed it to my girl, she quit me
Tryin to make a better way but it keeps holdin me
Deadly bomb, now she is schoolin me
My brother fightin me, neighbor dog bitin me
What is goin down? No one is invitin me
Be put into the parcel , it's not healin me
Broke as sex and it's killin me
I was a good citizen now I'm a leech
Get some other girl to increase my grief
My mom said that she better off without me
No girl, no friends, who cares about me?
Grand dad is mad, about to have a heart attack
Grandma is worried, she may think I'm on crack
I could collapse but I could feel myself
Come to the conclusion, maybe I should kill myself
You see what I'm going through?
I have problems, what can I do?
[Hook 4X]
[RZA]
I go to sleep to keep my mind from my sorrow
Hopin it'll be a new and better day tomorrow
And as I sleep, I dream, rearrangin, changin all bad things
The light is clear, my thoughts flushed loose
Things that I do well I put it to use
I rap, I write, I co' rock the mic
I do things good cuz it's things that I like
So I make the demo tape with my voice on track
Took it to Melquan, he sent it back
With a note attached sayin he admired me
Made me a contract and then hired me
Now I'm makin records, everybody praise me
Do I get scooped man? It doesn't phaze me
My rep is known all on the town
I once was lost but now I'm found
Put the pen to the fullest, brand new attitude
To those who helped me, I give my gratitude
Have a new girl, new friends, new ways
Could pass the gun now I have a new thing
It is true we all have problems
Well reach deep down inside of yourself and you'll solve those problems...

Divine Prince Master Rakeem Allah

[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard (woman)]
(You my Dirty whore, you that Dirty whore)
What else you gonna do to it
But bust it, bust it though baby, bust it
Who else, who else is gonna do it
This is dedicated to all you 
bitches
[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Knew this bitch named Trash, she had a hella fine ass
Can't ask, blew my hope in the past
Niggarette
 
gave me gonorrhoea
Pussy dick to the tippy toe like ballerina
Boy you should have seen her
She had a baby face creamer Purinas, called up talking Tina
I put my dick in her womb
She blew my head like a balloon
, 
I had her walking on the Moon
[Verse 2: Cappadonna]
I seen you at the 
five and dime
 wasting your time
Oh you shine, I'm looking at your ass from behind
You walked by smelling like watermelon
You might make me a felon
, 
my eyeballs swelling
My nuts start yelling, excuse my prick
Wanna have a talk with you, I'm sick
My medicine is can I walk with you
Fantasy, after that we can cheat
Laid on the bed
, 
handcuffed with hard meat
 
Long stroke smacking, smack it then broke
Nothing can't stop my continuous poke
Compound, porno flick music
Daddy came with it when I wrote it
[Verse 3: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Dirt Dog be bouncing on bitches like fog
I pollute the air up like smog
, bitch
I'm up my jacuzzi, peeping this smoothie
My bitch is a floozy
Dirt Dog ain't choosy
, pussy move me
Pretty black dick up in the booty
, 
I like it muddy and swampy
By now you find your ass up shitty creeky
Don't got no fucking room me and my momma in my teepee
Blackberry squeeze, bitch you a tease
Titties small, I got used to the squeeze
Fuck that shit, I'm through with this bitch
Old hen please can't get a bank of these welfare cheese
Now to blow fifty G's overseas
I'm doing the breeze, in my 850
[Verse 4: RZA]
Suicidal, she been in more hotels than bibles
Idol worshipping
 
bitch wasn't the type to make bridle
Strung on how the bitch manoeuvred her tongue
From the top of his dick to the bottom of his ass split
I told the God to jet quick, this wicked bitch was a harlot
But had him trapped up inside the Charlotte Web
She wasn't choosy, fucked for a movie and a loose leaf cigarette
Pussy stay wet and juicy like lemons
, 
big ass in tight denim
Had the most faithful niggas sinning against their women
And enjoyed to watch relationships get destroyed
This unemployed welfare bitch was non-void
And shameless, her attitude was blameless
Even though she had a hundred dicks on her name list
Her obsession caused niggas to get the ass cheek injection
The bitched lied, said she had Urinary Tract Infection
I tried to warn 'em and bomb 'em, but she conned em
Wanted niggas to fuck her raw dog without no condom
*woman moans* oooooh, ahahhh, ohh
[Outro: '4 Assassins' samples]
You people are all trying to achieve the impossible
That's exactly what we've done
But you'll fail and you'll all die
If we die, the next generation will fight them too
And the one after them for as long as they must
And eventually we shall succeed

[Intro]
Caller: "So whassup man?"
DJ: "Coolin' man"
C: "Chillin' chilin'? Yo, you know I had to call, you why right?"
DJ: "Why?"
C: "Because, you, I never ever call and ask you to play somethin' right?"
DJ: "Yeah"
C: "You know what I wanna hear, right?"
DJ: "Whatchu wanna hear?"
C: "I wanna hear that Wu-Tang joint"
DJ: "Wu-Tang again?"
C: "Ahh yea, again and again"
[Inspectah Deck]
I smoke on the mic like smokin' Joe Frazier
The hell-raiser, raising hell with the flavor
Terrorize the jam like troops in Pakistan
Swingin' through your town like your neighborhood Spiderman
So uhh, tick tock and keep ticking
While I get you flipping off the shit that I'm kicking
The Lone Ranger
Code red: DANGER
Deep in the dark with the art to rip the charts apart
The vandal
Too hot to handle
You battle, you're sayin' goodbye like Tevin Campbell
Roughneck, Inspectah Deck's on the set
The rebel,
 
I make more noise than heavy metal
[Raekwon]
The way I make the crowd go wild
Sit back relax, won't smile
Rae got it going on pal
, 
call me the rap assassinator
Rhymes rugged and built like Schwarzenegger
And I'ma get mad deep like a threat
Blow up your project
Then take all your assets
Cause I came to shake the frame in half
With the thoughts that bomb shit like math
So if you wanna try to flip, go flip on the next man
Cause I grab the clip and
Hit you with 16 shots and more, I got
Going to war with the melting pot
 
hot
[Method Man]
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth
Movin' on your left
And set it off, get it off, let it off like a Gat
I wanna break fool, cock me back
Small change, they puttin' shame in the game
I take aim and blow the nigga out the frame
And like Fame - my style will live forever
Niggas crossin' over but they don't know no better
But I do
True, can I get a "suuue"
Nuff respect due to the one-six-oooo
I mean ohhh
Yo, check out the flow
Like the Hudson
 
or PCP when I'm dustin'
Niggas off,
 
because I'm hot like sauce
The smoke from the lyrical blunt makes me *cough*
[U-God]
Ooh what
Grab my nut, get screwed
Oww, here comes my Shaolin style
True B-A-ba-B-Y-U
To my crew with a "suuue"
[Ol Dirty Bastard]
C'mon baby, baby c'mon baby, baby c'mon baby baby c'mon
[RZA]
Yo, you best protect ya neck
[Ol Dirty Bastard]
First things first man,
 
you're fuckin' with the worst
I'll be stickin' pins in your head like a fuckin' nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with a fat rugged stack
Shame on you when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zoo
And I'll be damned if I let any man
Come to my center
You enter the winter
Straight up and down, that shit is packed: jam
You can't slam,
 
don't let me get fool on him, man
The Ol' Dirty Bastard is dirty and stinking
Ason Unique rollin' with the night of the creeps
Niggas be rollin' with a stash, ain't sayin' cash
Bite my style I'll bite your motherfuckin' ass
[Ghostface Killah]
For crying out loud, my style is wild, so book me
Not long is how long that this rhyme took me
Ejectin' styles from
 
my lethal weapon
My pen that rocks
 
from here to Oregon
Here's more again
Catch it like a psycho flashback
I love Gats
If rap was a gun, you wouldn't bust back
I come with shit in all types of shapes and sounds
And where I lounge is my stompin' grounds
I give an order to my peeps across the water
To go and snatch up props all around the border
And get far like a shooting star
Cause who I are is living the life of Pablo Escobar
Point-blank as I kick the square biz
There it is, you're fuckin' with pros and there it goes
[
RZA
]
Yo chill with the feedback, black, we don't need that
It's 10 o'clock, ho, where the fuck's your seed at
Feelin' mad hostile
Wearin' Aéropostale
Flowin' like Christ when I speaks The Gospel
Stroll with the Holy robe
Then attack the globe
With the buck-us style: the ruckus
Ten times ten men committing mad sin
Turn the other cheek and I'll break your fuckin' chin
Slang boom-bangs like African drums
(He'll be) coming around the mountain when I cum
Crazy flamboyant for the rap enjoyment
My clan increase like black unemployment
Yeah, another one down,
 
G-g-genius
Take us the fuck outta here
[GZA]
The Wu is too slammin' for these Cold Killin' labels
Some ain't had hits since I seen Aunt Mabel
Be doin' artists in like Cain did Abel
Now they money's gettin' stuck to the gum under the table
That's what you get when you misuse what I invent
Your empire falls and you lose every cent
For tryna blow up a scrub
Now that thought was just as bright as a 20-watt light bulb
Should've pumped it when I rocked it
Niggas so stingy they got short arms and deep pockets
This goes on in some companies
With majors
They're scared to death to pump these
First of all, who's your A&R
A mountain climber who plays an electric guitar
But he don't know the meanin' of dope
When he's lookin' for a suit-and-tie rap that's cleaner than a bar of soap
And I'm the dirtiest thing in sight
Matter of fact, bring out the girls and let's have a mud fight
[RZA]
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck
You best protect ya neck

[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to welcome to you
All the way from the slums of 
Shaolin
Special uninvited guests
Came in through the back door
Ladies and gentlemen, it's them!
[Inspectah Deck]
Dance with the mantis
, 
note the slim chances
Chant this 
anthem, swing like Pete Sampras
Taking it straight to 
Big Man On Campus
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Scandalous, made the metro panic
Cause static with or without the automatic
And while I'm at it, yo, 
you got cash, pass it
It's drastic, gotta send half to Dirty Bastard
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Waves is spinning
, 
blades is spinning
Slay em in the eighth inning
Stay truck
, god 
stay playing linen
Kill rap, observe 
the uptowns
, ho, feel that
Mink jeans on
, seen where the real at
2000 Zitos
, 
moving with a ill ego
For real, for real, ill lines, ill people
Yo, bring it back, 
9 more civilians
Pollying deals, monopoly and bills, y'all niggas lying
Caught 300, lab look royal wit a mean stomach
Go broke, all seen, done it
Words from the 
heavy set
, if I don't eat, then we already met
Fly ass bro, 
liver than coke
[Verse 2: Method Man]
Now what Clan you know with lines this ill?
Bust shots at Big Ben like we got time to kill
Niggas can't gel or I'm just too high to tell
Put on my gasoline boots and walk through Hell
With 9 generals
, 
9 ninjas
 in your video
9 milli blow, semi-auto with no serial
Man metaphysical, I speak for criminals
Who don't pay they bills on time and fuck with 
digital
Never seen, 
smoke a bag of evergreen
My sword got a Jones
, 
more heads for the severing
Johnny in the dungeon, taking all bets, throw ya ones in
Scared money don't make money, throw ya guns in
[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
That's word to 
Damo
, San Juan, Puerto Rico
Blowin hydro on a beach
 wit 
Tamiko
My gun bullet hollow for you to swallow
Blowin' the nozzle, hear it whistle
One in the head, 
this is code red
, man for dead
X amount of lead spray from the barrel
Heat clear the street like Connor O'Carroll
Fully equipped, rifles,
 
banana clip shit
To make my niggas from East New York flip
[Verse 4: RZA]
Yo, you may catch me in a pair of 
Polo Skipperys
, matching cap
Razor blades in my gums
 (
BOBBY!
)
You may catch me in 
yellow Havana Joe's
 
goose jumper
And my phaser off stun
 (BOBBY!)
Y'all might just catch me in the park playin' chess
, 
studyin' math
Signin 7 and a sun
 (BOBBY!)
But you won't catch me without the ratchet, in the joint
Smoked out, dead broke or off point
 (
BOBBY!
)
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Wallo's comfortable
, 
chocolate frosting
Your socks hangin' out, yours is talkin'
Rock so steadily, son, I'm still crazy
Sport my old Force MD furs from the 80's
Nat Turners wit burners
, 
Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Taught y'all niggas how to rap, reimburse me
Rothsdale's
, ruby red sales, 
Bloomingdale's, blocks
Ox tails
 chopped up in Caribbean spots
I'm nice, maxed out, creepin' wit the ax out
Murder these bikini bitches,
 
switchin with they backs out
[Verse 6: U-God]
Niggas wanna pop shit, I pop clips
Bitch, I'll put my dick on ya lips
Alabama split, 
hammer slay quick
That 
David Banner gamma ray shit
Shells in the mouth, jailhouse snitch
My powder voice
, 
Snow White sniff
Verbal killas, 
gorilla grip
God body shit, 
puff Marley spliffs
[Verse 7: Cappadonna]
You might see me in a 6, that's not my style
You might see me wit a bitch, that's not my child
I be in the benzo, keep a low profile
Dead serious, take flicks and don't smile
Tryin' to get money, y'all cats is wild
I pose for the clothes, make a song like wild
I'm a chip off the board game, got sword game
Live life to the fullest, 
still want more fame
Darts on layaway, beats on standby
Outfits pressed up, ready for airtime
[
Verse 8: GZA
]
Run on the track like Jesse Owens
Broke the record flowin', without any knowin'
That my wordplay run the 400 meter relay
It's on once I grab the baton from the DJ
A athlete wit his iron cleat in the ground
Wireless nigga who sprint off the gun sound
The best time yet still 7.0
Swift flow made the cameramen clothes blow

Lay ya hammer (lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (lay ya hammer kid)
They want the drama bring it to 'em Fuck 'em
[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
All rise meet the preacher this pro dueler been diagnosed
Diabetic keptic I'm your host
Lock the vanilla suede British
Staten Island mall menace
Otherwise posing as a dentist in my lenses
Pinball machine gun rap spoke to Arafat
Laundry maid honey can't blow in this hat
What
[Verse 2: Method Man]
Is it raw now, change it around
It's war now, the final countdown commences
The battleground is twelve inches of wax paper
Breaking down your defenseless senseless nature
Pain stings with 'Ma Baker
Twin towering I skyscrape ya
Freedom come meet your maker
[
Verse 3: Inspectah Deck
]
Yo; Another sound boy's dying
Crowd noise multiplying
Don't let the fuzz slide in bust out the sirens
Sure win lure 'em in like exotic women
I smile with the sinister grin and finish him
You're fucking with hoods, get ya goods pushed back
Ya fraud, pull the wool off your Hollywood hat
[Verse 4: U-God]
The track melts in half liquors have this brave meaning
Supreme being being all that I can being
Picture wavy beavers meat cleaving your receiver
Fly sunny cheeba leather buckets dirty reefer
Fast floatin grill residential honey hill
Stainless steel rashes sheisty catch a money bill
[Verse 5: Raekwon]
It's all gravy
We floating through like the British navy
Fresh design lady  love the fade keep it wavy
The mix drink - throw the dick in the drink
Play it baby girl caught ya
Exotic album Cuban Link
Custom AV's beige panties who could front on these please
Y'all niggas broke so much your uncle sells trees
[
Verse 6: GZA
]
Yo; High ranked officials and armed tanks and missiles
Blood drizzle simple fact you slept on the issue
That before he started jerkin' off joysticks and Sega
I made tapes a hundred watt amps
 
insuring Vegas
RZA fine tune it shipping meal units
MC's ask, who be those rhyme killers in masks?
No doubt difficult task to last in the square
Beware infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious no opponents and blast through components
And microphones watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti that came approaching this
Incapable lust speech remains motionless
Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)
Lay ya hammer kid (Lay ya hammer kid)
Lay ya hammer (Lay ya hammer)

[Intro]
You will be punished (Wu-Tang style)
For all your evil deeds (Wu-Tang style)
Be warned - you will suffer (Wu-Tang style)
Justice (Wu-Tang style)
[Verse 1: GZA]
Slept on this hazardous enterprise
Hit from the back, from a long range attack in disguise
Week self-captivity became months
Those who were holdin' it down they hold a pump
Do we delay the conflict and prolong the suffer?
Got a mass of starvin' niggas wanna eat supper
Unfair corruptions lead to abductions
Creatin' wider circles of destructions
So we attack, with the pen and blaze in
From the terrifyin' to the fascinating
Quick to slay a narrow minded nigga that's hasty to give credit
Full of hostile overtones mixed with wack edits
They heavily defended airfields
But they bodies rot behind punctured steels
When I greeted you, you didn't hear a piece of my voice?
Oh that water was my liquid of choice
Forensic couldn't tell it, it was nine tons of steel pellet
Powerful projection, noise is deafening
Carrier battle groups, that's threatening
Higher level bombing, plus
The shipment in hand known as alarming, bells ring loud
In the same crucial manner but different style
[Bridge]
Wu-Tang style
Wu-Tang style
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Ayo once again, all blunts again
Yo the real remain silent, any type of violence I'm in
Allah's helpful most, innovative raps
That brought wealth through, shot out the belch too
We holdin', automatic semis with sick lines
Run up, body niggas, break down shoddy niggas
Styles so sharp, state of the art
Greater the mark, flyest creator sprayed layin' darts
Flowin' like water, "Apocalypse Now"
Gun out blaow, wow the shit's wild when you short us
Runnin' through parkin' lots, don't get caught
Let off, bark your shots, we outta here, off the blocks
[Verse 3: Method Man]
It ain't all to the good, muh'fuckers hatin' in the hood
Gotta a hundred wolves waitin' in the woods
For the Clan's forthcomin'
I miss you in the game a court summons
And fugitives of rap caught runnin, y'all get locked up
E'rything was wack 'til we popped up
And got it on and poppin' like Orville Reddenbacher
Potnah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Wu-Tang got ya, like every ghetto got a Tasha
Request lines are now open, you see these MC's chokin'
And thinkin', "What's that SHIT they be smokin'?"
I'm so focused, simple chronic halitosis
Keep my shit funky when I spit this braggadocious
{*hach, spit*} Y'all niggas got some fuckin nerve
To critic what I write, that's my muh'fuckin word
Blah blah blah, 
like N'Sync
Kiss that ass bye bye bye
 knahmsayin'? I ain't playin'
[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
Many shall come, few chose to stay exact
Track after track I'm fightin' for survival
Before me I see hills and mountains they sway
The words gotta move and the crowd's like the ocean
I walk water holdin' y'all suspended with the vocal
What's the total people that came to see the Gods?
I gave thought talent, construct my best poetry
Potentcy, high-level content
Side effect may cause a tec to eject, many places
All ages streets to cages, split faces
Shoutin' nuff love to the peeps from Miami
We live from Pulaski and spread glassy
[Outro]
Wu-Tang style

[Redman]
RZA came and got me
, this what I came to do, come on
Ring the bell so it's time to eat
Brick Dog stash weed inta AMI-seats
Bomb inside the palm
Doc rock a wifebeater with me beatin my wife ass ironed on
The front with my pump built like the Klumps
To carry it I take the spare out the trunk
I stay hungry, I ain't worked for days
That's why you see the pump when the curtains raise
Blast! Don't panic
Do I gotta explain how I tame and lock the rapgame single-handed?
Hell nah! I won't tell you son
If I find a wack ID I sell you one
Doc
 and 
Hot Nick
, 
Inspectah
My lecture's like Hannibal Lector's
Where's the ketchup?
Don't speak on it, shut ya trap
I see ya whole crew yellow like mustardpacks
Ah woo, Doc in my own zone
You say you got the rapgames sewn, but it's sewn wrong
I ride through ya hood in a Mr. Softee truck
Then pull a mac out a box of snow cones
Yeah, ya little fucks
Gimme ya fucking money!
*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*
[Method Man]
Uhuh, check it
I'm hotter than a hundred degrees with my coat on
Playing with a dynamitestick, where did I go wrong?
Somebody pull the fire along when Jonny stomp
If ya lukewarm leavin ya clothes and boots torn
Pro's and con's, megabomb's and so-on's
By arid actions try MC's to get their roll on
First issue got issues
What is hip-hop to Hot Nickles
?
It's like Funk Doc to snot tissues, word
Look at my hand and get the third
Finger out ya earhole like: Fuck what you hear
Now that's what I call hardcore, let's act fool
Mr. Fix-It like Handyman I pack tool
I been shitty, I'm from the bowels of the city (New York)
And just because my outfit match don't make me pretty
Baggy dungarees, dick need room to breathe
In a room full of crackers I might cut the cheese
Ain't no rules to the game, if it is we ain't playin
In your business like EPMD, "So What Cha Sayin'"
You co-signin that bullshit yo man tryin
Chaka chaka cha-ta tatat!!
Slugs flyin
*Shout-outs from Raekwon, Ghostface and Inspectah Deck*
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, ya
Check, the code echos from magazines to the big screen
Fo' wheel machines like ya wits scream
Kids fiend from the urban to sub-urban
Roll upon me thirstin like: Hey, hey, Mister Dream-Merchant
We roll longer than dice in a casino
Cee-lo in the 4, 5 or 6 with double 0
Behind the tinted windows I lay low
On some hydro tryin to slide from the 5-0
But now I get wild similar to Ol' Dirty
A third time felon just hit with over 30
No worries, style have em so thirsty
First degree heats are quittin on me
Cold turkey, no mercy
I bring the pain of a hundred migraines
But a thousand shoutin my name that's why I came
But first bring the cashburst, then the outburst
My surround sound pound ya ear like Jevon Kearse
I flex muscle outside I find a next hustle
Trouble with ya here and face the TEC-muscle
Even the best buckle win
I take it to the extreme
It gets ugly, but it's what a nigga do to get C.R.E.A.M
This life
*Shout-outs from Raekwon and Ghostface*

[Intro: Ms. Roxy]
It's Wu motherfuckers, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers, a Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu
[Verse 1: GZA]
Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a match to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scatting off soft-ass beats them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style deteriorate rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwing your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up if you mastered addition
Where I come from, getting visuals is habitual
You're more safe walking on hot coals in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, formed a mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it was plural
Rhyming while impaired
, 
dart hit your garment
Pierced your internal streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparalleled advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage
[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Bitchass niggas counterfeit the funk
I smoke the bead of the skunk
, 
tree top of the trunk
Moonshine drunken monk,
 
your head get shrunk
Your treasure sunk
, I be fucking bitches by the chunk
My name black, you worms wanna play in my dirt
Bitch stop, 
my Momma serve free lunch from the church
I cum like a thousand doves
Bitch you quiet at the bus, making no fuss, I gots tough love
Unglove the noose, watch a nigga transfuse
Dirty add to the fuse, heavy at the booze
I don't walk, I get carried
Gold and platinum Frisbees on my wall, 
looking properly
But comely
, 
I U.F.O. you Wright Brothers
The Indian that sold Manhattan to the white man
My grandfather, stepped up and get knocked right the fuck out
Come to the cook-out
, dirty bitch at the mouth
You scared, run around like a plane about to crash
[Break: Ms. Roxy]
Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers
Yeah and RZA
[Verse 3: RZA]
The Riddler
, 
funny bone tickler, freak Caligula
Bigger dick sex enigma, pistil fertilize your stigma
Stinkbox order from Pink Dot
MCs get stuck on ink blots, AirSound plug to the sinkbox
Wu-Tang Incorp. take your brain on spacewarp
Talk strange like Björk
, 
great hero Jim Thorpe
How can I put it, life is like video footage
Hard to edit,
 
directors, that never understood it
Too impulsive, my deadly corrosive dosage
Attack when you least notice through explosive postage
I don't play, the rap souffle sautee for the day
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig A
 
Leg Leg Arm Head
Spread like plague
, 
we drink Hennessy by the keg
I got the golden egg plus the goose
Eighty proof Absolut mixed with cranberry fruit juice
Ginseng boost
, 
I got your neck in a noose
Keep my money wrinkled
, the rap star twinkle killer instinct
Sixteen bar nickel sell more copies than Kinko
Grow like a fetus with no hands and feet to complete us
And we return like Jesus when the whole world need us
[Verse 4: Method Man]
Is it appetite for destruction
, 
slap a murder rap on this production
I touch something, trust nothing
Iron Lung/Twisted Metal
I see 'em ducking my dart gun, busting from every angle
Worldwide total carnage, 
the sickest flow
That be codenamed 
Agent Orange, killing you slow
It's only right you pay homage
 
to those
That's 'bout to blow like that shit up your nose
Solid as a rock when I strike target,
 
verbal
Be screaming on you like a drill sergeant
, 
herbals
Got me where I wanna be right now,
 don't know the time
Check the hour on your sundial, watch me shine
Drunk off of cheap wine
, 
each line be on point when I speak mine
On behalf of my crew,
 
SUUUUUUUUUUU
, 
Enter the Wu
36 more deadly Chambers
 
to take you through
[Outro x6: Ms. Roxy]
It's Wu motherfuckers
Wu-Tang motherfuckers

[Intro: RZA]
The Chinese have a saying: "Dangerous men will meet in narrow streets."
 And so it was. We were raised between the clans, and that meant pressure on me to make more weapons. And as word of the gold shipment spread, strangers suddenly appeared in jungle village
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
[Ay yo, ay yo] 
Machete still stainless
The archbishop run from the narcs
A crisp biscuit plus play the harp, wrist glisten
Goon captain, catch me in Africa black down with 4 5 Somalians
Black Tims,
 
rubber suit
 
Wonder Woman bangle
 
a blue coupe
I'm usually upon the roof countin' mad loot
Root beer reefer, teeth frame, doin' my 1, 2
Smokin' with a plain Jane trooper
Excellent with rifles, out in Japan
In a flight goose
 
switchblade that poke out the Nike boots
Thrusted on a 
bullet train
 with chains on, gettin' my train on
Thunder money, make bread, brainstorm
All this is made for the 
Forbes list
Broads get pissed, say "Yo he fucked me out his drawers he dissed me"
All this is calculated,
 the Batman with a black hand
Mafia money, killas who rock tans
[Hook: U-God]
Bone crushing, smooth kicks, blades choppin' through bricks
Masters of the weaponry, sells to both cliques
Blacksmith,
 
with the iron fist
X2
[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Rigor mortis, I watch the body rot to the bone structure
Scrape out your brain, watch your eyeballs rupture
Black magic, leave your fuckin' skull in a soup pot
Makaveli, Vamoose like 2pac
Suicidal tendencies, down the white Hennessy
Look in the book, I'm the definition of menace b
Chokin' niggas out for no reason, 
it's duck season
I'm cold as ice, 6 degrees below freezing
Stay dipped, rock a striped shirt like Freddy Kreuger
You'se a baby piranha surrounded by barracudas
Seven thirty, I'm more like 6 o' clock
Straight up and down
 beatin' up niggas till there's blood in they socks
Ox em, duff em', stuff 'em in black bags
Without gettin' no blood on my fresh rags
Ruthless, heart of a stone, grown with no emotions
I piss out 
brewhas
, poisonous potion
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kool G. Rap]
Yeah, it's the three deadly venoms
 
with weapons in the denims
Some shit that'll shake windows and break lay tenants
Come left field, aim crooked and straight blaze in em
Have you niggas with straight-legs with a fake leg in em
Wolf in sheep's clothing, eyes scoping a tender lamb
Spin you bitches like a ballroom dinner dance
G-Mode dress code got suspender clamps
Russian roulette, money bet, go and spend your chance
You little fleas get killa bees and army ants
EMS cut up your jeans like zombie pants
Hollow chrome to your collarbone
Ping against your dome piece and sound like the first key on a xylophone
Grown men discussing death and the malice tone
See how quick the smiley faces turn solid stone
Ghostface, Rae and G be the wildest known
We straight street, we keep seat in the palace throne
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Coach, put me in the game
I'm for real, for them peoples tryna to put me in them chains
Whatever the topic, let's put it in the frame
We can even load it and cock it and put it in they brains
I'm saying, some rappers do it for a chain
Kill yourself, I know killers that'll do it for some change
These veterans is slipping, they ain't doing it the same
I don't slip, set a pick and put a shooter in your lane
Precise, 'bout shoot them at the range
But I ain't tryna shoot it with you rappers
I'll just shoot it at your dame
Y'all never should have threw me in the game
Found a new word for weed, that was so mean
I threw it in my name
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
My song banging loud on the block like arms spraying
The law hating, 
warring like Blacks and Caucasians
God versus Satan,
 
I'm laying in the dark
With the Mossberg waiting,
 letting off first basing
Slim from the cotton club washing a scrub
Deuce high when he cruise by, spotting his love
Hold the mic like a .38 muzzle to snub
This flow, call it OJ blood on the glove
Above rap, capital Gs speak on the facts
Please believe that, 
meaning that I keep it a stack
He's back, he a beast on the track
The only time that I go soft is probably with your freak in the sack
Feel the bass make sure he shake, 
murder verse, first forty-eight
Manslaughter, nearly caught a case
I crack heads more than base
Stack bread when I orchestrate, that said y'all the bass
[Hook: Nathaniel]
No matter what the weather, we be getting our cheddar
So we can have a better tomorrow
Oh, money, cars, superstars, getting ours, working hard
For a better tomorrow
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I seen niggas sniff coke through a crazy straw
Come out they shirts sweating bullets with the Bobby Brown jaw
Dry mouth, grinding back and forth plus he's steaming a Newport
We all holding the torch
Few staircase murders, 
some burners don't blam right
Guns that kicked around the wall you better stand tight
Full of X, AKs, whiling in lobbys, bulletproof PJs
Fuck around and get spunned like the DJ
CSI traumatized by viewing the instant replay
SpongeBob niggas get scars nigga
I'm off style in any section of the hood I'll pull your car nigga
[Hook]
[Bridge: Masta Killa]
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
See ignorance wouldn't allow retreat
So you rather pursue death than admit defeat
[Verse 4: RZA]
I used to be so narcissistic, park the whip and spark the biscuits
Spit hollow tipped shells at the Narcs with quickness
Live to tell the tale cause only God's my witness
Been a long time, change gonna come son, I'm optimistic
I hold the steel like Ron O'Neal
Super fly,
 
do or die
, 
Killah Hill,
 
Brownsville
Never ran, never will, yes I can, yes I will
Put a dot upon your knot then I drill through your grill
Like a dentist,
 my apprentice speaks with a vengeance
Demented scientists count bodies inside the trenches
That's judges off the benches,
 
got inches for y'all wenches
We plant those hot seeds that grow in cold winters
[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Intro: RZA]
Huh, after all these years, what you said was true
The Shaolin and the Wu-Tang is very dangerous
[Interlude 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
It's the ODB kid, once again coming through your area
And I'm going to tell you one time, you gon' love this
[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
I had to get the money, said it wasn't a choice
Die Hard's on the bars, Ladies lovin' the voice
Morphine flow, numbing your joints
Bomb a nigga like he number 81 from Detroit
Zombie life, World War Z
Antidote to your virus, your highness, the world on me
Capital G, cool as the dude from Dos Equis
So deadly, I don't make it rain, I snow heavy
Sick lane, Nic Cage how I ride with fire
Forever with bars, sort of like a lifer
With the Son of Anarchy, I be Breaking Bad
Walking Dead, day dreaming of making a band
Dancing With the Stars, Americans Idol me
The Mentalist with the Big Bang Theory
[Hook: Method Man]
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
Still number one, still number one, still number one, one, one
[Verse 2: U-God]
The most duplicated, anticipated, validated
Urban legends in the books with the ones who made it
Highly celebrated, everything was work related
Current top 40 got the Wu deep in all their business
20 years Killa Bees, yeah, we hold the pennant
Monumental stance on the cover with my co-defendants
Drop her sentence, in remembrance
Construct these jewels so they can live through my descendants
[Bridge: Method Man]
Youngun, I can see your draws, pull your pants up
Can't even call yourself a man until you man up
And if you call yourself a fan you need to stand up
This ain't a party, it's a jux, keep your hands up
And I don't care who runs the city when the summer come
Your summer's done, Wu forever, and we're still number one
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Cappadonna]
Picture a nigga on the strip getting rich off the drug shit
Putting other niggas on, teaching ‘em thug shit
Then they want stick 'em up, then they get slugs quick
Hood-type niggas always living that crime life
Jealous-ass grimy niggas seeing the limelight
Slimy old nigga like fucking your man’s wife
Fool shouldn't use the word brother, he man dyke
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Yo, I spin my web all across New York
Get it out in all types of ice, there's a sport
One chain, two chain, three chain, four
Niggas mouth's drop like the leaves in the fall
Tone got that WBC
I take off heavy in air ballons and land in the Fiji's
That's my bird and that's my word
You faggots keep fucking around and get curbed
[Verse 6: GZA]
Forms circles like the rings of Saturn
Dust rocks and ice in a particular pattern
Then this fascinating picture has emerged from surface
A wonder of the young world with an urgent purpose
A wild fire engulfing every home
It's history chiseled and carved in every stone
A workshop where skills are learned
Handcrafted and drafted, written works the main concern
Urban center provided with a social structure
And a curious culture full of superconductors
Each stain is part of a scene with
Intricate geometric raps on a larger screen
Spell bounding, marvellous and it's surrounding
Viewpoints remain the same, it's all astounding
A place where the forgotten art is so powerful
A striking image is something that's so valuable
[Interlude 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
This one's the blackout! Three-fifty-seven to your mouth!
[Interlude 3: RZA]
GZA, this is called Ruckus In B Minor
Rae, all those bad times is behind us
Ghost, put that mask on to remind us
Method Man, let 'em know who's New York's finest
[Bridge + Hook]
[During hook: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Now I'mma let all you motherfuckers know
Whether you from Brooklyn, whether you from Manhattan
You from Queens nigga, I don't give a fuck
Where you be motherfucker!
[Verse 6: Raekwon]
My lines is like Peruvian coke, go ahead and try one
My recipe is A1 remarkable with my mixture
Rainman mathematician
,
 this city slicker
Finest threads cover my frame, the cloths of royalty
Strive with an army of winners and no pretenders
(*One*) We live free and achieve more
But first we gotta win with no stale mate
The all eye seeing is victorious biz to the sound man
[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
All my trucks, tanks are bulletproof, been the truth
Loot the track, clear the booth, my thought ready, aim, shoot
My knowledge one twenty proof, let's tear the roof off
Let's spray, M-A-S-T-A
King I Love-Love club, pack stadium rock
I hold the mic snug, split a slug
Black ninja, mask and gloves
[Hook]

Serial killers tote guns without the serial
High-tech, street intellect, all digital
Project original, sheisty individual
New York's bravest, always supply you with the latest
We hall of famers, and still hit you with the greatest
Took a year hiatus, now you wanna hate us
Thanks to all you haters for all the 
cream

[Hook]
[Raekwon the Chef]
Sendin letters to China, my cousin in Wendy's on Viacom
At home, it's worth money, I adorns
Order drinks, all real niggas order your minks yo
We got the fitteds on, lookin all fink
Daddy everybody get money from now on
Payday flash Visas livin like, Easter e'ryday
Don't fuck Benz, rather a 430
That shit that float through water, eyeball come up, drop birdies yo
[Method Man]
We can eat right, or we can clap these toys
I'm with StreetLife, ain't never been a Backstreet Boy
Who y'all kiddin? Tryin to act like my shoe fittin
Confused with ya head up yo' ass like who's shittin?
It's Hot Nixon
, same team same position
Battin average three-five-seven and still hittin
Y'all still bitchin, still lame and still chicken
I'm still here, one leg missin and still kickin
Cause I'm haaaaaaaaaaaard! Hard like a criminal
Love like a tennis shoe, throw slug to finish you
It's the Method Man, for short Mr. Meth
I can tell this motherfucker ain't Wu, look at his neck
"Comin from the thirty-six chamber" - Meth
"Bring it to em proper, potnah" - Meth

"Wu, Tang, Wu, Tang"
[Method Man]
It's Wu-Tang, rushin yo' gang, crushin the game
Pretty thugs, clutchin they chain, hand cuppin they thang
Who get strange, gassed up playin with flames
Let a nigga take off his shades, see what I'm sayin is..
[Hook]

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, yo, yo, what up kid? Yo, these niggas is back, son
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) I'm telling you, spit that, done it nigga
Yeah... yeah... yeah, yeah, I seen it like a Zenith, man
You hear me man? Word up, man, ya'll know what it is
It's on again, man, for real, Top Gun, what what
[Raekwon]
Aiyo, we came through thumping like elephants
The new Range is super-charged
, I remains intelligent
Back to the formula, lord, hard grammar
This is God school, make sure the lobby ain't jammed up
Excalibur swords, T-Rexes, bibles of rhymes
We in the lunchroom, weed and veggies for breakfast
Polo campus, sicker lances, the crisp
Hundred dollar kick niggas, that be showing you hand steps
Back to the dormatory, where niggas
Broke my forearm and index finger, now you write glory
True holding my flag, it's all engraved in my blade
So when I wave it, you gon' say Rae mad
Now it's 
28 Days Later
, now Wu's up, do something, you can't
It's blood in my eye, I might get amped
To rip something down, the billboard holders is back
So when you see me, you gon' say he gets down
[GZA]
From darkness to DNA, I move with my brother
And we resonate, energy that shifts in colors
Bringing MC's punishment, then I'm done with it
The meter leave way on the fast break, I run with it
It was not a hobby, but a childhood passion
That had started in the lobby and was quicky fashioned
Every line to line, bar for bar is clockwork
Hazardous and powerful enough to have your block hurt
Check the total amount of MC's inflicted
With torture, from moving with work that's restricted
We criticize producers til they joints are right
Then acupuncture the track with pinpoints of light
Hitting them from well conceiled firing positions
With explosiveness that'll make the deaf listen
Drastic, pyroclastic, connected with the same old
Down the dangerous slopes of an active volcano
[RZA]
Blitz like the Green Bay Packers, sack like the linebackers
Hang with niggas, like redneck crackers
Strangle cold bottles of Beck's, like a vexed German
Duck low behind the car, 
my tech burning
Neck burning, from eight karats of sunlight
Absorbed, 
in the grill, Big Pun like
Lord of the Wu-Tang sword, know what that means?
Like J.R. Tolkien, it's the Lord of the Rings
This is my man, Chef,
 auto, like Grand Theft Auto
The 18th letter, followed by the mark of Zorro
Plus A, not for apple,
 
but I pack an apple
Shorty try to buck back, and knock me off the saddle
Caramel, pecan, sundae, Pregline
Plump breasts, was filled with saline
Her big booty cousin, nasty Nadine
Get you on the floor, whore tried to double team
[Masta Killa]
Is he still that nucca? Is he in the hood like that?
Is he really strapped? Will he really split yo' shit?
I thought you said he rap? Pull up in the yard, ten sets
He ain't flexing, microphone ripping, heat holding
Who testing? Rope-a-dope his black lotus
Can't quote th
is, chat with th
e sword tongue
Duck when the axe is swinging, wild Apache drum
Crazy Horse kicking his thoughts, he won't quit
Can't tell 'em nothing, he grown, give the man room
Space was demanded, beat banging through the speaker
Voice, heat seek missle, guided at the listener
Swing to the gospel, catch up and wet at the brothel
Unstoppable, direction of my flow, optional
To the ear, depending on the current of air, the crowd's in

[Verse 1]
Method Man
As I walk in the shadow of death
16 men on a dead man's chest
Your host this eve

Momma used to say be a ladies man, yuh yuh yuh

All day every day, with the souffle'
All you cats got to react, to jump back
Kiss yourself, 'fore you get smacked
By the my appa-ra-tus comin' through with the stat-us
Connect-in', 
lethal weapon
, lethal injection
Visual unseen, like gene
When I had men, I'm unforgiven
Locked in prison, 
in the Wu-Tang dirty dungeon
You should come into my 12 bar dirty dozen
Love you to death now, kiss of death
Every body wants to do what they gotta do, to breath, try to eat
Your minds on the rhymin', dancin', runnin' in money
They get dope biz, step in the square, cats 'n' Clan over here
Playas'
Yeah, an' it's all G-O-NEE
Hehe

[Raekwon the Chef]
The Fuck?
It's just the new way of thinkin
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow...
That's how we doin it
Bound by honest sword take over the set; rap from here to Que-bec
Throw up the tech, crash your intellect select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
When nasty can blew, my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Askin my man'll get you slapped down; play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines soundin like crickets snatchin worker shipment
Pull the air, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who rip it?

Hear me, you jam all you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coke aimin at cha kidney

Five o'clock shadowboxer, hold down the sector

Suck my dick it's the kid with the fat knob

Quick get on your knees, with yo' sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spread it in shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently, on your clit
Ping-pong pussy, wide world of wombs
 titty saggin
Stomach on some scriveled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screamin that it's
TALKIN TO YOU DADDY, fart's breathin out your lips splashin my dick badly
Use vinegar, to try to tighten up your ginger
All-mighty dick, ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane
 attatched to God
Thick, like a great adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for slobbin my shit
You bit it on the couch, dry pussy leave the friction burns
Plus beef I hone, the condom broke
Bitch you got AIDS I'm shakin in my bones

Yo... this song is...
Aiyyo 
Dunn
 this song is called Sunshower
Cause we approachin the final hour
You know I ahh all I can say to my brothers and sisters right now
Is stay close to your families, and all your loved ones
Cause this globe is about to explode with hatred
They killin for pennies, knahmsayin?
Peace to the Gods, we got a heavy job... yo, yo
Trouble follows behind a wicked mind
, 
20/20 vision
Of the prism of light but still blind
Because you lack the inner
, 
every sinner
Will end up in the everlastin winter of hellfire
Throw on this mix just picks your third eye out
You cry out your words fly out, and sounds die out
You remain unheard, sufferin eternally, internal external
Along with your wicked fraternal from generals to colonels
Releasin thermonuclear heat that burns you firmly
And permanently upon this journey
Through the journal of the book of life
Those who took a life without justice
Will become just ice ice ice
It's been taught that your worst enemy couldn't harm you
As much as your own wicked thoughts
What devils fought we wrought, and let's annoint
Now you're bein persecuted by that universal court court court
Iron hell with the strong blend of rape and blend of sandal
With rose petals and jasmine, as men use talismans
Burn some incense, chantin witchcraft to reach high dimensions
I'm convinced, Allah is God always has been always will be
You could travel every square inch of the planet Earth and still be
Ninety-three million miles away from the sun
Til you realize you and the sun is one, like the knowledge
Know the ledge to where your heart is
Or fall off into the internal hell that's uncharted
Light travels at the rate of 186,000 miles per second
Through time and space, until it reach a target
And once we're freed of darkness
, 
and show em where the path
From which the Red Sea was parted
, 
into these straight
At the narrow gate
, 
but wide is the road to destruction and hate
What you thought life was a sport? A game?
One hundred years short, know the soul is immortal
Walk through many portals, and those who go astray
Will pay a judgment day
, 
and these few years of wicked bullshit
Ain't worth the eternity inside a sulfur lake
With dragons and snakes, and any pain you can imaginate
Instead, I chose to become a newlywed to the true bread
Of life and fed 
God Degree
 of light to my head
It's been said, the fool who sleep is already dead, so I stay awake
And take care of my brother
, and uncover reveal the skin
So we can see each other, cause every color
That makes the light appear duller, who's the colored man?
Who's the original, who's the biochemical
Who's the grafted digital, digital, digital, digital
Digital.. yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Two hundred thousand million atmosphere cubic feet of air we breath
While niggas minds are trapped twenty thousand fathoms beneath
The sea of reality, they can't inhale deep, devils have em
Stagnant, a trapping, the .45 magnum
And shatter bone fragments
Cops love the block you gettin backed up by Dragnet
Thrown into a six by eight steel cabinet
Liftin weights readin ancient tablets, back on the block nobody's havin it
Those who haven't learnt get returned
You freaky ass niggas get burned
Some walk around like they ain't concerned
With the hell goin on inside the world
Why do grown men molest little girls?
Is it because the girl's breast has swelled
To the size of a woman, although she's twelve
The whole world is sick, sick, sick
Trapped up in six, six, six
I started off as a pawn in this marathon of life
Tryin to carry on, wishin I had a bomb to blow up Babylon
A vagabond, tryin to steal his corpse we're from paragon
Goin in circles, like a ferris wheel
Undernourished meals I cherish hope, 
drown inside the sea of life
Use my third eye for a periscope
, and take flight to the edge of night
To far heights so dark that even wit a bright light
You couldn't see a spark of light
While others play ball, I recall, me and GZA, Dirty
Hangin in halls, bangin on walls
Kickin rhymes three hours straight with no pause
Boostin from Freeport sunrise to Amityville morgue
Kept razorblade between the jaws, breakin all laws
Started out writin fables to makin beats on lunchroom tables
To wearin long cables that hung down to the navel
So pack some crack and fat sacks of skunk
To funnel the P-Funk, smokin woolie blunts
Dust cocktails and primos, shot more dice than casinos
Back when Wu-Gambinos were called 
F.O.I.
 MC's
All and Together Now Crew
 B.C.C
REC Posse, 
G.P.
, D.M.D
Ol' Dirty stalked East New York,
 
GZA maintained Franklin Lane
I was going to Thomas the Jeff, where students got slain
Old Earth got nervous walked me to Shaolin sent me to Curtis
Took share time in Marquis, U-God general contractin service
While Meth Chef and Deck was off the New Dorp
For white boys who took steroids
Buildin up bicep tricep pectoids and deltoids
Back when our girlfriends was virgins
Cuttin class with Ghost tryin to bag hoes in Murry Bergtraum
A Maybeldine beacon night school Washington Irving
These young Gods was seekin
Hoes in Westinghouse and Clara Parton
 and 
Medina
Girls who sung like Sarafina
On the corner of Belmont and Picket Avenue I seen her
As if I dreamed her
I was dead broke, now I will use key notes to make G-notes
So it's always hope
See subway train run through the city like blood through the veins
To the heart of Medina, but Shaolin is the brain
So take heed to these words
And feel the power of the Sunshower
Approachin the final hour
Power equality, Allah Cees everything
Let's come together under the wings
And take flight, Wu-Tang, the saga, 
Rzarecta
In your sector

[Sample]
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
The fists are the arrows, the body is the bow
All movements have to be....
[Intro: Raekwon]
It's phat, man, it's phat, man
[RZA]
I'm the 7 in the center of the sun, I keep shining
My inner light would turn my baby's tear drop to small diamonds
That be twinkling, while my love be sprinkling
We stay young while your old wicked faces be wrinkling
Allah's the most gracious, he made the universe the most spacious
Seen and heard in all places, but still appear faceless
Embraces all races, all caste and all cases
In every spec of life he's the substance of all traces
The answer to all questions, the spark of all suggestions
Of righteousness, the pathway to the road of perfection
Who gives you all and never ask more of you
The faithful companion that fights every war with you
Before the mortal view of the prehistorical, historical
He's the all and all, you searching for the oracle
A mission impossible, purely philosophical
But you call him on your death bed when you laying in the hospital
And as you play all day like the grasshopper who work and toil
Like armies of ants carrying stones of soil
Building a home for themselves and storing food
At night we praise Allah and adore the moon
In sync like the flow of the Nile, the growth of a child
Only fearing God, we great a ghost with a smile
That which is spirit is spirit, which is flesh is flesh
Meaning life has no partnership with death
Yo, I've been highly misunderstood by those who met us
They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce
Mentally dead, essentially led
By the false teachings, and eventually pledge
Their allegiance, to that which was against them
And exempt them from the truth
Then juiced them and pimped them
To give it in tithes, so the church can rise
While their babies home hungry covered with flies
Bzzzz, trying to harness the wind
Allah's the father from without and within
On Christ return, who will announce him?
Every tree is numbered, but who can count them?
The name of all things on this world, who can pronounce them?
Allah's the father of all, why do you doubt him?
[Sample]
The heart is the general, the eyes are the scouts
The fists are the arrow, the body is the bow
All movements have to be natural
The wrist must be strong and the fingers powerful
Fast, high kicks, a good firm stance
Avoid the enemy's strong points...
Eagle's Claw!

[ODB]
Daddy's home, your daddy's home to stay
[Meth]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo same time same channel
Nasty vandals too hot to fucking handle
Bring the ruckus to all you knotty head fuckas
Shit's like Hammer Time, niggas can't touch us
[RZA]
Straight up and down Wu-Tang forever
Come tougher than DJ Run's leather
Make a better tomorrow
Condition your atmosphere, air like feathers
The fire come, transmit vire come
The higher sire come, we burn your wire
Wu-Tang be number one...
[Meth & RZA]
Four years ago a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Meth and it went this way
Yo, we took a test to become an MC
All the withers in the crowd got amazed at me
God threw me inside his Cadillac
The chaffuer drove off and we never came back
Meth cut the record down to the bone
And now I rock solid chrome microphones
Now we signing autographs, with cheers and laughs
Champagne, caviar, and bubblebaths, but see...
That's the life that I lead, you sucka MC, we G-O-D
Take that and move back, or catch a heartattack
Because there's nothing in the world the gods could ever lack
I chill at the party in my b-boy stance
Walk, cap low, 45 in my pants
Fly like a dove, that come from up above
My nigga's Iron Lung but you can stay one love
It's just a one two three a three a two one
Throw your blunts in the air for the god Iron Lung
Blow them right in your face with the bass
You messed up, come in first place, the real rap taste
First come, first serve basis
Coolin out boo, take you to the def places
One of a kind for you people's delight
And to you sucker MC, you know it ain't right
Bet you bite all your life, cheat on your wife
Run in a gun fight with nuthin but a knife
Bangin with your boy, slingin with the crew
And everybody know what you've been through
It's the one two three three two one
Throw your blunts in the air for your dunn Iron Lung
Smoke in your place with the highs and the bass
Come in first place in the real rap race
Go uptown, buy a bag of brown
You sucker MC, a sad face clown
Gettin OD ready to rock crowds steady
You drive a big car get your gas from Getti
[ODB]
I'm ODB in the place to be
Didn't go to St. John's University
In the streets of Brooklyn I aquired the knowledge
A Law of Mathematics that's higher than college
I'm fly on skins that I gets in Queens
She love filthy swine and my collard greens
I'm dressed to kill, you know our style
Cause niggas don't know that Dirty Dogg fly
If you wanna see me baby come, you know Dirty Dog is number one
X2
I wrote this song about the (?)
You gotta know where to start when the beats play
X2

[Method Man]
Oh yeah, coming through with my Shaolin crew
Two cent for a case, gimme St. Ide's brew
In the midst of broken bottles and crushed up cans
Methtical's in a jam, oh how dry I am
[Raekwon]
With St. Ides in my system
Crack another I'm blessed, let's go get the next one
And get over, the object is to stay sober
Lay on the sofa, better yet, dial my chauffeur
[Ghostface]
Call me the Wallabee Champ, stretched out, could never be Son
Ricochet daily hit the deli for a cold one
Naturally blessed, yes, my rap is like a laser beam
That blows in the bushes, St. Ide's fill the canteen
[U-God]
Crack the bottle of the St. Ide's, sipping to those
Who don't realize that drinking ain't only to be drunk
You can't drive, keep my peoples alive
And if the saint don't know you from a can of paint
[RZA]
It was hot on the spot so I jetted up the block
I saw Ak with an Ide's, I could tell by the dot
On the back he be building, not that charcoal filtered
Ice cold bottle tilted, to my cup he spilt it
Ahh St. Ides

[Hook]
(After laughter, comes tears)
[Verse 1: RZA]
Check the script, me and the gods getting ripped
Blunts in the dip,
 
forty dogs in my lip
Had a box, 'Boom Boom' the bass will blast
We was laughing at all the girls that passed
Conversation, brothers had began to discuss
(Hey yo, Ra, remember that kid ya bust?)
Aw yeah, he ran, but he didn't get far
Cause I dropped him, heh heh heh heh heh ha
Not knowing exactly what lied ahead
My little brother, my mother sent him out for bread
Get the Wonder, it's a hot day in the summer
Didn't expect to come across a crazy gunner
"Hey Shorty, check it for the bag and the dough"
But he was brave, looked him in the eye, and said "No!!"
Money splattered him, BOW! then he snatched the bag
Hit his pockets, then he jetted up the Ave
Girls screaming, the noise up and down the block
(Hey, 
Rakeem!
) What? (Your little brother got shot!)
I ran frantically, then I dropped down to his feet
I saw the blood all over the hot concrete
I picked him up then I held him by his head
His eyes shut, that's when I knew he was...
Aw man! How do I say goodbye?
It's always the good ones that have to die
Memories in the corner of my mind
Flashbacks, I was laughing all the time
I taught him all about the bees and birds
But I wish I had a chance to sing these three words
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Ghostface]
Me and my man, my ace big Moe from the shelter
Bout to hit the skins from this girl named Thelma
Now Thelma had a rep that was higher than her neck
Every girl from Shaolin dissed her respect
We was stimmy, you know how it is when you're blitzed
Three o'clock in the morning, something got to give
Moe said he'll go first, I said I'll take next
Here, take this raincoat and practice safe sex
He seemed to ignore, I said, "Be for real!
"She's not even worth it to go raw deal."
A man's gonna do what a man's gonna do
He got butt-naked and stuck the power U
Twenty minutes went by, Moe I'm out without a doubt
I'm not pumping up, I am airing out
Hey yo, he came out laughing with glory
I'm surprised, he's still living to tell his story
But he carried on with the same old stuff
With Stephanie, like a Whammy, he pressed his luck
Moe tried to be down with O.P.P
Ain't nothing wrong but he got caught with the H.I.V
Now no life to live
, 
doc says two more years
So after the laughter I guess comes the tears
[Hook]

Blood money mercenaries, think you can muscle Wu?
It's a foot race, who can out-hustle who?
Hip hop junkie flunky, monkey see, monkey do
Great minds connect like mobster rings
Sit back, let me do my, Sinatra thing
I'm in the Hip Hop Hall of Fame, on the wall is the plaques
Old ball and chain, I named her Madam X
She love big cannons, sex unprotected
You better respect it, kid, we 'bout to set trip
You get ya neck ripped, eyeballs are scoping
I don't sell crack, I sell dopium
Catch him at the podium, nah, he moving too fast
Professor X, behind the bulletproof glass
You need a Wu pass, a bag of that high
Easy with the flicks, baby, I'm camera shy
[Hook: Method Man] + (George Clinton)
Get that money, God, keep your sword sharp (1-2-3-4)
[Cappadonna]
We might have to 8 Diagram one of y'all MC's
We grind everyday and we hustle for cheese
Got our face on the front of CD's, we off the hook
W.T.C. y'all soft and shook
Y'all not built like the Cuban Linx Clan that get CREAM
And back heads down every time we sing
Give us a hundred grand for a show, let us rock
For more money, more chicks, more private stock
[Streetlife]
They call me Streetlife, slap the taste
Out ya mug, know ya place, you ain't thug, fix ya face
Throw a slug, catch a case
Meanwhile, beat trial, back on that cash cow
Getting CREAM, however, a street brother know how
Point blank, I'm pulling rank, calling shot, I got bank
Pass the rock, my hand's hot, hit 'em with the showshotter
Peace to my ala mater, Wu-Tang block scholars
Never settle for less, promoters pay us top dollar
[Hook: Method Man] + (George Clinton)
Get that money, God, keep your sword sharp (Eastside, Westside)

[Outro: George Clinton]
The Clan'll talk, Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit, we was s'posed to be cool
Only the clue's on the other end of the stick
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackrock hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Barney here is down to a feeding dreadlock
Armpit like two Buckwheat's in a headlock
Macy Gray's hair between your leg lock
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
{*coughs*} This shit is strong, god damn, what you got in there?
Over-crowded police blood bamboo bimbo
Chickenhead skeezer crackhead hoodrat
Somebody let the monkeys out the cage
Ya mother's so cross-eyed, when she cry tears roll down her back
Calabama niggas all'll quit
Talking that short dick shit
Speak up, no loud speaker but I'm speaking loud
Venacular ass kicking, truth got there in crowd
Shit, they call me the lethal lip
The linguistic, full metal jacket of venacular ballistic
Shooting out at the mouth without Chap or Blistec
Here's a mothafucka, I didn't flunk diaper rash
I'm verbally toxic, metal-piercing, forked, hollow point tongue
Dum dum, pow, shot from gattling gums
Hooked on phonics, packing a vicious vocabulary
Malicious, with malice and mayhem
Fuck a dictionary, give me the mic and I'll slay
Them and literally poetic symptoms
Pissing me the fuck off, missing me with that shit
I stick a venacular foot so far up in ya ass
You won't be able to pass verbal gas
So far in ya ass that one of my knees will rise so far above ya head
And you drown of a poetic ass kicking
Leaving lyrical lacerations on your lungs, from a verbal hangnail
That hung on my big toe, as I flow upward
Kicking yo on ya eardrum, you wanna hear some?
Tap dance on ya tonsils, leaving kiwi shoe polish on ya breath
Cavity in ya best rhyme, and I'm the access on the rest
Call me the proverbial verbal menacing dentist
With the drill, I got lyrical skills
I could perform oral root canals
It's unwise to fuck with me
Kick ya wisdom teeth down ya throat
Leaving you to choke
On where it hurts, unspoken vocals
Tying down ya vocal cord and windpipe tight
With toe jamming and ya mothafucking hemmoroids
Fuck the dumb shit...

[Intro: movie sample] + (Raekwon)
On the firing line... lock, one round load
Ready on the right? Ready on the left?
Ready on the firing line? Watch for ya targets
(Yeah, yeah, yeah...) pay attention
[Raekwon]
Welcome to the fish fry where niggas get burnt to a crisp
Jump out the pot
, 
"Yeah yo I got this"
Long armor, 
construction's on, I'm pro-drama
Catch me in the wildest beefs, I bring bombers
Bearded like Talibans,
 booted, my black ninjas
'll come through,
 
tuxedos on with the
 
gold llamas
Priceless like emeralds, check out the ski mask
King Tut's nephew gave it to me for three bags
Of heron, 
Don Baron, sniff a bag of blow
Fifth out, runnin' up in Saks with the ill army
Shake feds, play dead, yo check out what Rae said
Lay on ya hands, let the Branson break bread
High energy, 
all my niggas a kin to me
Regardless how it go down I still get ten a ki
Beware of my enemies, y'all remember me
Nikes with the low goose on and I've been a beast
Wilding in my headphones, red in my stones
Good ganja out,
 
if I die fill up my headstones
With water, dough, acid and gold classics
All my niggas who pump, the spirit'll jump out and grab shit
Max with the laser on 'em, staircase caskets (caskets)
Broke bugged thugs in the hallway maxing (maxing)
[Interlude: Inspectah Deck] + (movie sample)
Still them 1-6-Ooh niggas, straight up (whoa, hold up, hold up)
[Inspectah Deck]
The nozzel aim, rip through ya frame for pocket change
Fiend for the Rush Hour 4, then pop a vein
Thousand dollar corks pop,
 pause or get off top
Used to be a general, just lost your spot
Animal House, two grand'll handle ya mouth
Beast mode with the G-Code, cancel 'em out
Son, I've seen hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms
Don that I am made 'em bow in the face of God
Graveyard Shifting, different day, the same thing
The name ring then the chain swing and dames cling
Money green, Maury kicks, whips and new fitteds
(It was all a dream) Advocated by the few who do live it
Bloomberg, make a nigga cop the Mausberg
Shorty ain't a shorty, he a
 
Shooter like Wahlberg
Old man told me, don't be, blind to deception, only
Sharp with perfection, homey ,ya mind is a weapon
[Interlude: movie sample]
Relax, you got ya muscles tight, relax
Word... Word...
[Hook: Method Man] + (U-God)
First we told y'all niggas, then we showed y'all niggas, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
By the time you get a show, we've been all around the globe, huh?
(We gon' take it back with this)
Before you even had a name, you was screaming "Wu-Tang"
(We gon' take it back with this)
When we was running on the block, you was under ya pops, remember
(We gon' take it back with this... let's go)
[Ghostface Killah]
Armored truck money,
 
Shazam bangles
, play the throne like
Julius Caesar, gorilla mob, slash, Killah's 
gaurd
Fake passports and visas, all of my goons
They be carrying spoons, because boom, he had a massive seizure
Hot chocolate lovers, guns is published
Detroit bitches out of town be dying to fuck us
This is real talk, shank lullabyes
Ben Franks,
 we like Jet Blue we stay hella high
Curl on the dumbell L, we can't even S-P-E-L-L MTV or TRL's
Supreme novelists, we rank superior, guarding the post
Down low in the 'jects, got it locked in ya area
Ain't tryin' to hurry up
We like rebel niggas powdered up wilding in the streets of Liberia
No matter the crime, I'm beating the case
If I'm a wrong, a chair hit a judge right in his face
Shitting shanks out, come to court dates
Mittens on shines with blood Wally's that's the color of wine
[U-God]
Talk to me, my criminal mystique
Kick back the boards, six thousand a week
Pay homage, what the don beat, you're a minor threat
I see ya sweat roll down ya cheek
And ya soft and sweet, ya talk is pork
Get murdered in New York when I enforce the heat
And the cost ain't cheap, my advice is priceless
Bring back the life that ya thought was lifeless
The Way of the Gun, son, who the nicest?
S.K., no stungun, smooth devices
Time Crisis, I played the game, low lifers
In a brawl, ripped the phones out the walls in Rikers
Vipers in the infirmary rooms with slicers
Shiesters with hate in their blood might bite ya
Fuck that bitch, ya wife don't write ya
Cancel her, buy another one just like her
Pipers in the bucket of ice taste righteous
Today's mathematics when we build in cyphers
The baby automatic kill like Air Force strikers
I'm still Asiatic when I spill the hypeness
[Interlude: movie sample]
The dark, and this place will come here
That's right!
[Hook]

[Intro: 'The Master' sample]
I despise your killing and raping
You're despicable (Are you my judge?)
It's just you should be punished
I'm gonna chop off your arm, so are you ready?
[Verse One: U-God]
Check these high hats sling tings moving through the rubbish
Party robust, rec room style for you brothers
Time's ticking, erupt misconduct
Entering one funk before the drum dry up
Dial, style, jab vocab slow
Alphabet run, construction voice might blow
Tap dance swelling 
Hemingway novel model
For a breather, dirty reefer hide your bottle
Cut down, come with something that's round and profound
Blood brothers, people of colors, we get down
Watch this fly, force feed things being said
Nine Diagram acid black evil red leathers
Mic half a dangle, serious a man
My mic clapper death wish, everlasting plan
Heavenly God body, know me as the cleaner
Night champion, old villain style seamer
Kiss a spider, Seagal saga why bother
Godfather talk drama, fly swatters
[Break]
Number two, Chao San Poi
[Verse Two: GZA]
This Wu shit be hard to kill and full blown
Rhymes filtered through the net before words hit the chrome
Pro tools editing tracks that's rough
Cause a jam without a live MC isn't enough
So we attack this and grab all within reach
Throw a scrap back to niggas
,
perfect your own speech
Shit is copper, it ain't worth the mic stands
Used by backup singers in Atlantic City bands
Niggas look on and get hooked on this mic line
Reeled in and shipped through the pipeline
LPs delivered with style and potential
Niggas flowing smoothly in a sequential
Order
, 
revealing hidden tape recorders
Stashed inside pockets of those who lack aura
[Verse Three: Raekwon]
Twist the DAC up
, 
them niggas with math is back up
Watch he act up, fifty-two block track we slap up
Playground manoeuvre, jet to Vancouver like this
Two Kahluas one chick, she's German Luger
Get the shit on, light a fresh pack, bust it open
With the seal on Dunn, deal on this, with the real on
Necks rocky ring, call it the Decatur
Slang soufleer
 home decorater, player
Mic immigrants, nine of us formed resemblance
Somethin flashy, God dead-armed is nasty
Peep the ornaments enough to make Shorty-Wop stare at me yo
He killed the God might as well throw a chair at me
[Verse Four: RZA]
Yo MC's wonder what's hip-hop thunder
Tell you the truth it's just
 
one nation under a groove
Gettin down for the funk of it
Like Fred Sanford in the biz...
Yo one held his paraphenalia, a Wu memorabilia
Mailed by the fortune teller, tried to tell ya
Bout the group recruit we 
scoop up CREAM like Breyer's
Then spread across the globe like telephone wires
Thirty-six assorted, Shaolin imported
Chambers been recorded, you're fuckin with the loops
Time for royalty audit
Fabulous establishment metabolism
, 
Blackfoot Indian
Cherokee started out smaller than amphibian
Then grew to a physical body
 with 
five meridians
As the pendulum swings closer to the millenium
Two thousand, wickedness is spread amongst my citizen
I got a muscle the industrial to make a hustle
And politic with Lyor and Russell
When niggas is still rushin we'll brush you
[Break]
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
[Verse Five: Masta Killa]
Thoughts are contained in the trenches of the brain
Ignite, blowing the mic to Arabian heights
As I recite this medley, niggas couldn't fuck with the
Deadly ground I hold down
Classical gangland style, shots hit the ceiling
Panic and confusion echoes through the building
Continuing to build, I strive for perfection
Driven by the will to live, Glocks I hold
Shots I give, while searchers of rescue teams
Look for means of survival and who's liable
For this harrowing experience
You scream for the extreme, fiend for the cap
And proceeds of the Wu-Tang Academy
To fuck up your anatomy with assault and battery
[Outro]
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
Number one, Yen Chang Wa
He's an adulterer, don't trust him
Number two, Chao San Poi
Number two, Chao San Poi
He's a womanizer, but he's an expert at throwing knives
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?
I despise your killing, and raping
You're... despicable
Are you, my judge?
It's just... you should be punished
I'm going to chop off your arm, so are you ready?

Yo RZA, yo razor,

For rhyme and for rapture, got niggas resigning, now master

So, when you see me on the real, forming like Voltron
Remember I got deep like a Navy Seal

Yo! I come with that ol' loco, style from my vocal
Couldn't peep it with a pair of bi-focals
I'm no joker, play me as a joker
Be on you like a house on fire, smoke ya
Crews be acting like they gangs, anyway
Be like, "Warriors, come out and play"
Burn me, I get into shit, I let it out like diarrhea
Got burnt once, but that was only gonorrhea
Dirty, I keep shit stains in my drawers
So I can get fizza-funky for you
Murder, taste the flame of the Wu-Tang, rah!
Here comes the Tiger vs. Crane
I'll be like wild with my style
Punk, you play me chump, you get jumped
Wu is coming through at a theater near you
And get funk like a shoe
What?

Yo, yo
Never doubt the Life
(EHHHH! YO!) Yo
Who the fuck are you to criticize me?
Yo, I slap, yo, I slap dick ta ya wifey
Yo (respect, that's my word)
[Street Life]
Another Wu tradition, Street vision, listen
All my life I've been poverty stricken
Always took what's mines, never was given
A second chance just to rap sheet a bad decision
You can't knock the hustle or the life that I'm livin
Quick to stick the clip in, blow you out position
Street juridictions, nigga, no restriction
Concrete composition for emcee's in submission
Special edition crash course mission
Push through like the task force and crush all competition
See you from a distance, dry snitchin, whisperin
Greet your man posted up like two little bitches
When you get the heart, step live or catch stitches
Or find yourself with Del, sleepin with the fishes
I got no love for fans that's fake ass niggas
I can't stand the bid when it's all in my business
Wu-Tang Forever and a day, don't get it twisted
I get lifted, I just shoot somethin from hot buscuit
These street kids, we can't lost, we terrorize you district
Leave no finger prints and no survivin witness
Chorus: Method Man
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide

Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go

Yo, thoughts sharper than a Japanese Kitana
Ninja coma, pirahnas crack teeth on my armor
Scadalous, I ran contra-bomber, 
stalker like rebels of Rwanda
Death before dishonor, snake charmer, persona of one who makes drama
Godfather 4 type saga, tuckin a revolver in my Parker
Bombin unprepared for departure, might talk but strike harder
Fear the bow 
o
f the silent archer
Sure shotter, pass the rock to your starter
Poison darter, news photographers document the horror
While I bounce Shaunda with Tiwana and I from blue Honda
Honorable scholar, rockwilder, rip mic's for top dollar
Your highnes, the crowd hollar
Got your head rock, feel the brain trauma
Crowd sponser, hotter than Bahama steam saunas
The Rebel of opera, popped off the choclate and the ?gosha?
Monster truck crush you imposters
Chorus: Method Man
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide

You ain't got to love me, or even pretend to
Actin like the street, they ain't got no street credentials
Crack villians, raps be killin instrumentals
The caps pealin and slap a feelin out ya dental
Underground, sound, for ghetto residentials
Up shit's creek lookin for some more shit to get into
Got the Clan jewels as I continue
To serve you everythin on that's on the menu
With 
Chef John Jacob
, remember Sunz Of Man told you Wake Up?
My nigga smell the coffee, I'm too hardcore to kill softly
Come to free the mind and get the bullshit up off me
The Jedi, only use The Force if ya force me
Shaolin What? Don't get it fucked up and cross me
Rappers gettin stuck for actin stuck up and 
flossy
Say it ain't so! Bust the callico
Rap from the Island called Stat', here we go
Chorus: Method Man
Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide
It's them kids from the otherside "Shaolin" Worldwide
Method Man, Homocide, nowhere to run to
Nowhere to hide, boo, we P.L.O
Fo' sho', if it don't flow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it don't blow, gotta go
Fo' sho', if it ain't dough, gotta go
Some didn't listen 'til my gun went BLOW!

[Verse 1: U-God]
When I'm locked down I use Timbs as my shower slippers
I'm in the background mingling with the powder flippers
In the basement, hard-body power lifters
I crush sour in the sifter,
 
see how I lift her
Universal God I stay scientific
The kid with the Golden Arms,
 
Iron Fisted
Stay Asiatic, so cinematic
Noise in the attic, bang out with them automatics
It's hood politics that bring the hunger back
I'm straight chopping wood, call me the lumberjack
Check the catalog put out a hundred packs
Watch for drug sniffing dogs they coming from the back
I'm straight thunder clap the funky drummer's back
It's pure Dopium,
 
give em a heart attack
I stay stacking plaques like ancient artifacts
Joe Namath in the game I'm the quarterback
[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Eight balls of coke,
 blunt to the greenery
Pounds in the trunk get you a concrete scenery
Handmade ox'll get you dumped in the mess hall
Snitch niggas run to C.O.s to confess all
This is street knowledge, knowledge I school college
Like a speech from the GZA, sharp like the RZA
Don't run with a scissor,
 nigga the truth is the
Truth, now I'mma drop a few jewels in the booth
Used to boot crack, stuff em inside a tennis ball
Ans throw it when they rushing the block,
 
trust no cops
Driving around with two mitts in my socks
Cooked coke gon' get you in more trouble than money
Don't crawl through dust juice
 
the pigs is hungry
You think they ain't watching
They watching while you uptown copping
Back home while you're cooking and chopping
They scheming on the block waiting to get it popping
[Verse 3: GZA]
He had a sword and an axe with cuts
Under a road that was woven from silver and gold, waxed it up
His army was so great in quantity
His crops and livestock boost the economy
Many would travel by boat to see him
His image adorned most schools and coliseums
A merchant, hustle those silk and velvets
Portrait illuminated when the torch was well-lit
Picture so beautifully painted that
One thought it would breathe or move cause it would leave a mood
Or energy
, 
you see his wife practiced Yoga
Made herbal enhancers that had saved the soldiers
Guard the treasures in the chambers, halls and vaults
Well-prepared for all assaults
Heavy guarded village
Armed with the sharpest weapons designed to pierce and cause blood spillage
[Verse 4: Masta Killa]
From a young teen, a murder team, inspired by crime
See Allah Just granted permission for my position
Sit down, write rhymes, escaping this repetitive cycle
Slinging dimes, losing time, doing hard time
Teaching y'all mathematically
, 
come see
The epitomy of what you wanna be - emcee
My semi-auto gun mandatory at the sound clash
The mic touched, dance mashed up, pounds of the best
Green glass bottles of don, I sip the liquor slow
Flow so devastating when I go solo
Even when I'm dolo, pretty gun I'm holding
Head swollen off the solid gold soul
Iron Mic pole beat your face like you stole something
, trust me
Living life royalty, all wise and healthy
Welcome to the best of me, from knowledge to infinity
Never stopping my projectory, I'm galactic
[Verse 5: Cappadonna]
Yo, peace to all of the gods and all of the earths
We been building like this ever since the first day of birth
The more I start to build, the better I feel
Keep ignorant niggas from me, use dummies for shield
You're not Godbody son, you're just garbage and real snotty
Cherry head gaylord still stuck in the lobby
This the first Now Born, son I'm blessed with mad lessons
Conquered crazy devils, my mind is a weapon
You can't fast with me and avoid the swine
You degenerate emcee, I'm the best of mankind
Allahu Akbar
 straight jewels and real stars
I'm down with the RZA, got help for the Widow's Son
Pop off on you, you ain't nothing to me - DUN DUN
Original Tyzeem
, 
Holy water, Visine
Designated wordplay, 
God respect my deen
Shine on little stars and respect the Queen
[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
New York Giant, call me Deck Umenyiora
Fresh with the water connect, two and a quarter
Deal with the dealer, don't trust the transporter
My job is done once I get it to the border
Perico, coke game is kilos of cocaine
Hypodermic needle to the groove, I dose veins
Overdoser, you know the product is raw right
Lines take you there like I wrote it with off-white
Got him bent up, hands looking like a tin cup
Sorry no consignment, get your ends up
Move from the gate now, he on his way straight to Jake now
I'm on the hush with my weight loud
Got the shakes now, how they want it bad
Five or six heads chipping in for a bag
I got the works like a burger deluxe
Get your fix while I'm serving it up, word to us

I'm a dollar and a dream from seein a brick
In grimy hallways, slingin nicks and treys
When it's on then it's on and poppin, shots lickin
I'm spittin this shit for the hood, Glock clickin
Tension in the street, we stressed, still wanna eat
I walk through the valley of death, the hotstepper
Holdin red pepper, everybody on reach
I need a beat to expand, the mind guide the hand
Pen stroke, excellent quotes of literature
Nights over Egypt, black as Arabia
Gundeliro self I savior, I need the (uh)

[Ghostface Killah]
Aiyyo, aiyyo
Aiyyo I got the whip smellin like lemon
Roger Clemens jerseys the man blew seven cold coolies in the Worthy and
I crush those rappers, keep the toast near the rad-iator
We like our guns warm, it's easier to make the papers
Stayed off, 
the cape came off, Ghost G'd off
The track's like doin six months and I'mma beat off
At the airport attention always flow in my direction like
You let the best then sparkle his perfection and
Bitches be askin them, Ghost you got so much shit
You need to cash in, bracelets matchin 'em
[U-God]
Yo, yo
Line Cadillacs to blocks, 
Richard Pryor

Redd Foxx
Jukebox records, flatfooted cops
Get automatic systematic jumpin in your socks
Mama's apple pie in the park hopscotch
Reunited on the radio, Wu-Tang superb
In the sprinklers girls double-dutchin on the curb
Sinatra, the pop the Jackson 5 recordings
Uptown Saturday
, 
"Cotton Came to Harlem"
Ringmaster circus was, Bailey and Barnum
Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom
Dr. J before Jordan
, 
Al Green on the organ
When Rerun did the dance, the whole world saw him
The blackout fears, Foxxy Brown, Pam Grier
Ford motor gear, your life and times queer
"Smokey the Bear", Burt Reynolds gray hair
Throw 'em some gems, throw up your fists and say yeah, it's

Yo check one two
Without me havin my finger in the plug
I'm gettin shocked anyway, hahaha!
"Since you're all so skilled
Let's fight your way - Shaolin style. Come on!"

[Method] Uhh
[M. Killa] 
Deadly melody part two
[Method] That's my word!
It ain't safe no more... bitch!
[Masta Killa]
Yo, yo
Brain gets punctured and drained through the nasal
Hour of assassination be upon you
Movin with the tiger strike, bound, gagged and shot
Red the head in, dapple light centered
East remains hot with police
But I keep a lease for my, four-fifth automatic
Extended clip rewind, bust mine
Anytime you reveal your snakeish ways and actions
Observe the magnetic attraction
[Method Man]
And it's time for some grid...
[Street Life]
...iron rap, action-packed grudge match
Tough act to follow, hard copy novel
Throw you off the Verrazano
We swimmin with these sharks, yo I rate bodyguard
Stamp my initial in your birthmark
P.L.O., bust like a calico, tally ho
Black expo, Tecs in afros, we back yo
It's Dolemite, crash your windpipe, with the mic device
Fatal strike, daily mic fights, shoot out the street lights
[Method Man]
Sight beyond sight, late night, city light
Tight like a virgin
, mergin with my A-Alikes
Splurgin, dirty to the grain, no detergent
Filthy, innocent until I'm proven guilty
Submergin, deeper in the lecture I'm servin
Truth or consequences, life or death sentence
I'm hurtin, your person, I'm certain, it's curtains
Chorus: Method Man
It ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cause you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lot of sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Wu can't lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This one is complete, it captures bass
[Inspektah Deck]
Yo, I bring chaos to blocks like the riots in Watts
Rapid fire shots ripple through Kevlar, 9 Glocks
Technique of rhyme pop machine gun ammo
Sporadic flow buckled a foe, intro to outro
Calico, throw verse, but slide my dough first
I make thousands in the club with no shirts, go bezerk
From the Shao' borough, whylin out on the furlow
Commando, styles thorough, solo inferno
It burns slow, thermonuclear degrees
Heads are underseas down to the youngest seeds
Wannabes clone, they light like summer breeze
Hundred G's for the Garden, them fans stampede
For the top cats, hit the mic like the iron-palm blast
Equipped to perform the task
S-I-N-Y, and what, head or gut
The head rush, will cause your cerebellum to bust
[Killa Sin]
We be the world's most fabulous
Hazardous, to fuck with these ravenous
Killers get you stuck to the wall like wooden cabinets
Extravagant, je-wel drop a helicopter high
Up into the sky, lines philosiphize, I got stocks to buy
Watch my pockets rise, to the bottom bust confide in God
In Sin I trust, the villianous, criminal minded killers rust
I intend to build and fortify in men
Mastermind rhymin, navigate the globe then retire quick
[Raekwon]
Aiyyo fluid rap bend through it black, buluga black Ac'
Tackle that, ghetto tabernackles throw it in your lap
Slang A-K, national, geographical
Mathematical, slide up in your work casual
Nike Air Dog, who wear it all, plus down to brawl
All a thousand with a bloody hair, flammable
Rap mayors, who clap Himalayas pinky fingers
Ever glacer, lacer, hand laser touches grail bomb blazers
Sly-workin, network bezerk, mad hurtin
Killer whales, fucking up sales, crash Bloomingdales
Masqevendo, John Lennon tenor break, mad descendo
Fuck y'all niggas carve my ice through your Benz window
*door creaking open*
*gunshots followed by a car alarm*
Chorus
[Method Man]
Uhh.. Spazz-Ola.. (Spazz-Ola)
S-I-N-Y 10304
Lock your doors
Crack your jaws
Drop your drawers
It's all day everyday with this rap souflee

[Hook: Sunny Valentine] + (Tash Mahogany)
She's my number one gangsta chick (my starter) She's my number one starter chick
She's my number one drafted pick, she's my number one line on the hit
I only wanna see it (my starter) It's truly needed, When the ball drops...
Anything she say, you know I'm gonna do (my starter)
Watch out, watch out, when that ball drops...
[Streetlife]
You'se a starter, like Candace Parker
Take flight like Skywalker, might wolf it on ya father
Student Athlete, player of the week
G.P.A. 4.0 and her game's complete
Skintone buttercream, all defensive team
Dreamgirl like Jennifer Hudson, you're my Queen
To be, I'm ya King, keep ya under the wing
Together we can capture the ring
You the human highlight, body type, just right
Hairdo stay tight, go hard ball all night
All-star shine so bright
Hall of famer, about to take the game to new heights
You're my number one draft pick, McDonald classic
No look dunks to the basket
Yeah, yeah, that's mine, that's mine...
[Hook]
[GZA]
Blunt smoke, fifth hundred stroke
I'm going nuts, full clip, shoot up her fat lips
And round butt, catch Heat when I'm In Too Deep
The answer beeps, she take dives on the busiest streets
Whatever situation or the circumstances
Outdoor, indoor, she's taking the chances
Hotel, motel or Holiday Inn
Overlooking that bible, she continued to sin
Spread wide on the desk, paperwork all in a mess
While the ceiling fan blowing her dress
Ten minutes of jerking along with the slurping
Her skirt hid her talent until I raised the curtains
Showtime at the Apollo, she'll follow my lead
Then get on her knees, then swallow her pride
Strapped and ready to ride
[Hook]
[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, that's my down bitch
That's my down bitch, anything she do for her man
If it's lying on the stand, fish frying in the pan
She a Queen like Liz the third
, wicked curves
On her word, stay still, rocking linens and furs
While she do it in the sack, jazz music in the back
Flat blew a nigga back, act two, I'm into that
Damn right, she the star of my team
When we stepped on the strip, baby girl, we the heart of the scene
Whether Brooklyn, Bronx, Manhattan or Queens
Staten Island, she styling, if not, she's not seen
Playboy status, every man's lust
She acting all shy, but she likes handcuffs
[U-God]
I'm the first on the court, first to hit the dance floor
The floss in this rap sport, what more can ya ask for?
Let ya glass pour, Wu-Tang is here now
All my Independent Women, time to let ya hair down
Bottles popping, everything is fair ground
Fresh legs, window shopping, can't help to stare it down
You'se a starter cuz I chose ya first
Baby, you'se a starter, where you throw that skirt
Lady, you'se a starter, where ya hold it down
Yeah, I'm Cold Blooded, then ya love my style
This is rush hour traffic, first one to merk off
It's like clockwork, first to get ya work off
I'm the workhorse, Killa Bee performer
Pro darter, starter, not a bench warmer, what?
[Hook]
[Outro: kung fu sample]
You've learned how to kill
Every moved you've learned is trained to that end
Yet, we wish to preserve life
The first thing to learn, is that difference
Then you can start training with us, from the beginning

[Intro: Gerald Alston]
Ooh-wee... mmmmmmmm, yeah...
[Verse 1: Gerald Alston]
See I was raised out on these mean streets
I'm from the projects, right, where poverty and hell meet
I'm searching everyday to find a better way, I've got a
Hustle still to get my pay before I hit bottom
Now some might say that I'm already there
But who are they to judge or question what I do, son, so I don't care
Tired of eating cheese sandwiches with no meat
Tired of watching all the playas from the same seat
So it's a life of crime, some might sing or rhyme
To escape the ghetto before the flatline
Choices to make, what am I gonna do
Got to use my talents, they gonna pull me through
[Hook: Gerald Alston]
Now with success, I become a target
They wanna set me up, 
I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna get me, wanna hit me, strip me of my riches
They wanna cut me up in pieces, leave me deep in ditches
[Hook: Gerald Alston]
And I can't take it.... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... yeah... ohhhhhh
Fight to stay alive
[Verse 2: Method Man]
I was raised out on these mean streets
You know where poverty and hell meet
Brothers get jail and life's for sale, cheap
Since momma held me, in her arms, to tell me
That it's a cold world, I done held heat
And held myself down, lot of bodies and shells found
And niggas into taking everything, that ain't nailed down
We fell down
, ain't hard to tell now
I ain't trying to see the cell now
Or see momma put her house up for bail now
So I'ma give all I got, to try and get that gwop
Nigga I'm hot with this hustle, go 'head and get the cops
I use my talent to get more figures
Unlike these little corner store niggas
Go change your drawers, niggas
[Hook: Method Man & Gerald Alston]
Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage, or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want a clip me, leave me stiff in ditches
[Hook: Gerald Alston] + (Method Man)
And I can't take it, no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(This ain't no game, my life ain't nothing to play with)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Face it, money is power and I'mma make it)
I'm gonna make it... oooh...
[Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, I'm gon' survive, yo, yo, aiyo
N.Y. City, gritty blocks, little love, plenty cops
Few rise, many drop, True Lies, semis cocked
Fishscale, already rocked, heavy shots, that we drop
New guys on every block, blue eyes and red dots
Pregnant mothers, broke fathers, more money, more problems
So hungry, won't starve 'em, work hard and so pardon
I got mouths to feed,
 I got pounds of weed
I need some more, another store, another house, indeed
An X amount of G, the reason pounds'll squeeze
And strip you naked, basic, trying to make it out the P's
Don't ever doubt a G, 
and have me spaz like
'Face with the K, and my nose all powdery
It ain't about the streets, it's 'bout the beast within
That won't give in to 'lice, down to bleed, G
[Hook: Inspectah Deck & Gerald Alston]
Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, take me hostage, or take me down some notches
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, wanna clip me leave me stiff in ditches
[Hook: Gerald Alston] + (RZA)
And I can't take it (yeah), no, no, but I'm gonna make it...
(Yeah, yea, turn the beat up a little right here)
Yeah... I'm gonna make it... oooh...
(Yo, yo, yo, yeah, yo, just, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang)
[RZA]
Aiyo, RZA, Meth, GZA, Deck, Ghost and Chef be cashing checks
Killa, Cap be snapping necks, Street and 'Zilla flash the tech
Sacrifice a savage life, if he trying to bag my ice
Tag a price on merchandise, tell me, is it worth ya life?
[Gerald Alston]
No... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive
[RZA]
Aiyo, metal pipes ignite, sparking fire, light the darkness night
Trying to stick me for my riches, now y'all bitches taking flight
Major business, raise the digits, tried to strike me for my life
Slice and dice, men or mice, GZA tell 'em what it's like
[GZA]
Aiyo, money making, people flaking, Cash Rules, 
fuck the bacon
Earthquaking, head is aching, bank stop, dice shaking
Times are hard, so are jobs, scheming niggas wanna rob
Use a ho to slob ya knob, hit you with unruly mobs
Stab you in the back and smile, watch you bleed for a while
Hating on the agile, steal ya name and bite ya style
Hold you for a ransom note, 
Goliath cutting David's throat
Grab ya vest, abandon boat and leave you out at sea to float
[Hook: GZA & Gerald Alston]
Now with success and I've become a target
They wanna set me up, I guess more money equals more problems
They wanna hit me, wanna stick me, get me for my riches
They wanna diss me, want clip me, leave me stiff in ditches
[Gerald Alston]
And I can't take it.... no, no... but I'm gonna make it...
Yeah... oh... I'm gonna make it... ooh... yeah...
It's a cold, cold, cold world
I got my hand on my gun, they got a brother on the run
Yeah... it's a cold, cold, cold world
You can't be playing games with my life
I've gotta fight to survive, fight to stay alive
This ain't a game, this is my life
Keep pushing me to the edge, I'm gonna push back
And you won't like that, it's guaranteed you won't like that
When ya laid down, laid flat...

God damn man these radio station be buggin
Man it's three o'clock in the mornin, damn
This hip-hop shit just keep
Damn we got to slow this shit down man, yaknowhatImean?
[Tekitha]
Fiends were never waiting in the hill
They ran one step ahead
But the jiggy was always there
Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then suddenly in the sky
Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the ear
With the melody of a train (Lord is suddenly here!)
False MC's are melting
In the dark, all the weak LP's are
Going
Dowwwwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape out, early May
And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make
It
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmme
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Upon the project pavement
There was death, enslavement of the mind
Single mothers are filled with stress
Between the new world ages
We were blessed, and Wu-Tang fills the air
With the knowledge that God posess
As I lay there with my baby
We would look, from the window, and cry
Then the Wu-Tang sign appears, in the sky
Billboards started melting
In the dark, all the weak MC's are
Going dowwwwwwwwwwwn
God released the tape of, Earthly pain
And, I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmme
And I don't think the world can take it
Cause it took so long to make it
And the hip-hop game'll never be the sammmmmmmmmmme
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
Wu-Tang

[Intro: U-God]
Yo.. yeah
Don't erase none of that good shit in the beginnin
Yo.. spill drinks on ya, get stank on ya
Yo.. yo.. pinky ring shit, yo
That pinky ring shit, yo
[Verse 1: U-God]
It's that pinky ring shit, the legend of masked kid
Shoot out the speakers when my guns get jurassic
Superbad, who am I?
 
Dolemite classic
The vandal's back, 
hands on Angela Bassett
I handle my plastic
, gunplay I mastered
No coke, dope mixed down with acid on record
Broken down and crafted in seconds
Lady's choice
, the golden voice still peppered
Better, respect it, bitch believe
I pull rabbits out the hat, tricks up my sleeves
I air out the showroom, the shit can breathe
Fix your weave, behold my expertise
[Hook: Wu-Tang Clan]
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
I got my uzi back - you dudes is wack, face it the Wu is back
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Take it back to the peoples, 
leanin' gettin' rec room punch
We in them authentic alley switchin joints
Major general niggas, five stars
Both arms rock
 
when coke dropped we read a hundred niggas palms
Silencers, garbage bags of hash
For every cop we paid retired now the nigga on smash
Gash you out your burner fast
You swing down hatin me now respect get your fingers off the glass
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
Yo what the fuck yo?! Yo what the fuck y'all comin for?
Get the fuck away from my door!
We got big guns in here, coke over there
With blue bag and E pills stashed under the chair
And there's Boss Hog black and white pit with the pink lips
Stan thought he was soft 'til he bit his fingers
The shit had me dyin yo, big fat nigga bleedin
Big cat nigga all season
On the beach truck, stuck with 
Hawaiian ice
Diamond twice the whole city thought I bought FUBU
Blew you, 
authentic doodoo
, picture the fog iced out
18 karat rap
 
between noodles
[Hook]
[Verse 4: RZA]
Up at Killa Bee headquarters
, four whips just pulled up
I saw Johnny sippin Henny from a iced out cup
Yo with the blunt, 
two-way vibratin off the hip
I sit took three drags off the honey-dip
Now what you talkin? You see my gold fronts sparkin?
Ain't tryin to hear what you dogs be barkin
Read the headline, that was blast on today's Post
Dead king, thought he could ace Ghost
Queen couldn't even jack Monk
Probably find him in Doc Doom's back trunk
Bdoodoodoo
! 
I'm up at the Wu library
Readin Malcolm's, ".. Any Means Necessary"
[Verse 5: Method Man]
John John, Bacardi straight up hold the ice
So nice like New York they had to name him twice
Name your price, 
I black out then change the lights
Give you the same advice that I gave my wife
Don't fuck with mine, Clan give you lumps in nine
Let the smoke cloud clear so the sun can shine
Culture shock, for some of us that's all we got
Whether you ball or not, you can all get shot
[Verse 6: Inspectah Deck]
New York, New York
, legendary rhyme boss
Code name Charlie Horse, bust with blind force
I smash set it and wreck for cash credit or check
You crash-tests can't measure the threat
I dance on a nigga like my name's Zab Judah
Rap barracuda
, 
three XL kahuna
Sure to get it perkin and cause a disturbance
I'm thirstin, feel what I feel then we can merge then
Creep it through the states in V8's and 12's
My weight's hell, fuck with me then brace yourself
The Noble, Sir I
 mass mogul
Known to blast vocals, and 
move global on you locals
[Verse 7: Masta Killa]
This is grown man talkin, coward I split your head
I'm from the East where the streets run red from the bloodshed
Hit Chef
 for the rice and peas
Nuff respect Father E tumbled at ease
My brothers can't wait to squeeze the automatic
They need wreck like a drug dealer need a addict
Floatin on the 95, sting like a killer bee
Your hands can't hit what your eyes can't see
[Verse 8: GZA]
From dark matter to the big crunch
The vocals came in a bunch without one punch
Rare glimpse from the, strictly advanced, proved unstoppable
Reputation enhanced, since the cause was probable
So you compare contrast but don't blast
Through extreme depths, with the pen I hold fast
Watch the block thirst for one became all
Shot 'em with the long forgotten rainfall
Delivered in a vivid fashion with simplicity
The blind couldn't verify the authenticity
The rhyme came from the pressure of heat
Then it was laid out, on the ground to pave streets
[Hook]
[Outro]
{*scratching "
Suuuuuuuue

[Unknown conversation which carries over from the last track]
That's black? Whattup God?
Aiyyo Shorty got beef with that nigga? Word?
{*blam, blam blam*} Oh shit!!! Yo!
Hold the fuck up
[Intro: Inspectah Deck]
Aiyyo yo, 
eight niggas down
 (just enough)
Fuckin around with my sound (ci-ty)
Yo, bring backup (ci-ty)
Fuckin with me, and mine
Murderous, check it, yo
[Verse 1: Inspectah Deck]
The world is shifty, we living just enough for the city
The rough witty Killa Bee sting just like the jiggy
My Family Stone, foes attempt to gradually clone
Labelled MIA and I send the casualties home
In closed coffins, 
Wu storming like the light brigade
Ride the wave like Frankie Avalon
 inside the cyber age
Crime pays, 
the law's long arm be tryna strong arm
Walking time-bombs who thrive on firearms
The charm smoker, I hit the dread with a poster
We told 'em to show him love and exposed the black toaster
Composer was shook, I took your bad looks for joke
Get your back broke, deep throat this Murder, I Wrote
The antidote be seeking like a buried treasure
By every measure lethally inject your whole sector
Wanted Dead or Alive, Rebel I escapes
Across the desert sand, leaving no footprints to trace
Keep a war face
, your place conceal the baby knives
On the North breaks, 
I still shine in shady times
[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
Yeah, yo
We living just enough (living just enough)
Just enough for the city)
Just enough for the city
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
In the jungle
, 
I make moves like Iron Monkey
Plots to bump me off, _____ be on the hunt for me
We stay hungry for money drugs and guns
Ones who fake get caught in the crossfire for crumbs
Know the science be my guidance
The facts tell, gats sell like sex and violence
And break the project silence
, a vision
This is way beyond four corners
, 
escape this mental prison
Before we're all goners, now embrace the world
For the world war is ocean bomber, visionary soldier karma
My code of honor, mind still scarred from the drama
Trauma sent to victim, witness them run, scream in horror
Military chopper come gun down the slum
The outcome do or die son, it's bound to come
Mentally aware I see truth within the square
The future's here catch me on computer software
Warfare's inevitable, 
Rebel I hold several government official
Issue thirty-eight specials
, that step through
Like Nat Turner create a spectacle
I may die in the scuffle but I'm taking forty
 
devils
[Hook: Inspectah Deck]
We livin just enough
Just enough
Just enough
For the ci-ty
[Outro: Inspectah Deck]
Killa Beez, stinging MCs

But it's all good cause I'm the soul controller
YouknowhatImean?
Rather I say we the soul controllers
The bottom line, like I said
Deal with freedom, justice, equality
You know?
Keep shining, add on
Food, clothing, and shelter
All my niggas, go pick up uniforms
Go, when you buy this album
Go pick up uniforms, for real
YouknowhatImean?
Cause don't think we doing this just for anybody
We doing this shit for certain niggas kid
Certain people rather, certain
Certain fans, certain supporters
Certain delegators, word
What the fuck man, I'm tired of seeing these
Fake ass niggas fucking, running with the fucking globe
Ain't even, ain't even really seeing it the
Way it, it should really be seen
YouknowhatImean?
It's like, if you going to spread mathematics
Spread it right
YouknowhatImean?

Snowy night
, 
fiends basin'
, 
A Raisin in the Sun was amazing
The joint on the dresser, a gauge went off
Jumped up, fish tank, it fell, and they stuck
They shot her cousin LaVon, he owed a buck
Willie was awful, 
pulled out the ratchet, let off two
Grits fell on his leg, Kiana ripped the cold bowl
He violent, an Island nigga with the talent
Of six killas who just came home, from straight whylin
Robbin everything in Macy's, Lacy, short haircut
With long arms who fuck niggas, got four babies
Yvette jabbed her, slapped her wig off, ran in the crib
She did the dumb shit, my nigga then clapped her
Lester, smoked Chester sister Vest, I heard it was a mess
They ripped the apple out her throat, blessed her
Hungry hyenas from Medina
, 
all eight trainers
Who got reluct', think fast and blast from Beamers
[Ghostface Killah]
Yeah, yo
I brought my bitch out to Pathmark, she's pushin the cart
Headed to aisle four, damn I got milk on my Clark's
That's what I get, not focusin from hittin that bark
My mouth dried, need plenty water quick, I feel like a shark
In the aisle bustin them paper towels and
 
wipin my Wally's down
I stood up to face a barrel
, he's holdin a shiny pound
It's him, he want revenge, I murdered his Uncle Tim
I sold him a bag of dope, his wife came and copped again
{*singing*} That bitch is crazyyyyy
And uh, she brought her babyyyyy
She knew I hard the murders of smack
It killed her man though
, 
now I got his fuckin nephew grippin his gat
You's a bitch - 
{*singing*} you better kill meeeee
You know you're bootyyyyyy
You pulled your toolie, out on meeeee...
 motherfucker
First thought was to snatch the ratchet
Said fuck it and fuckin grabbed it
I ducked, he bucked twice
, 
this nigga was fuckin laughin
I wrestled him to the ground, tustle, scuffle, constantly kicked him
He wouldn't let go the joint, so I fuckin bit him
Shots was whizzin, hittin Clorox bottles
Customers screamin
, 
then the faggot ran out of hollows
I had to show him what it's all about
Next thing you read in the paper, "A man who came to kill gets knocked out"
[Interlude: Erykah Badu]
I don't know whyyy-hy-hyyyy, nobody told you
Man's not supposed to cry...
Though we're just babies, and you're so crazy
How tears of joy bring so much life
[Method Man]
Yo, aiyyo yo yo
You on your way to the store nigga grab me a Dutch
, 
I'm mad as fuck
My dude, my count was short when I was baggin it up
Now I need liquor, nigga pass me a cup
What's up with Officer Brown?
 
The other day he tried to shackle me up
He killed Kase and now he hasslin us
This motherfucker got balls
, even the gall to try and pattin me up
Time to re-up
, 
let these niggas know we back on the block
With three hundred off a G-pack, crack in the spot

The Legacy, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready
And held a breath of life, resurrect the death of Christ
What you got to sacrifice, I'm on some other shit
Takeover the mothership, brothers get to claim the covenant
Universal lovin it, olive oil you rubbin it
Check the thermometer, ever kilometer
Rise by heat pressure, your thermostat couldn't measure
Royal Familia, atoms bombs from Asquilia
Dark Ages, so read the page, Mike and Alenki
Born on the cross between love and lust
Genisis thru exeuse, larzurus, slash black barnibus
The holy temple be the mental, You and see Islamic
Can you understand the clear picture
[Hook]
Braveheart, verbal courage, battle the seminar
Royal Fam Legacy, watch us travel far
Positive energy, always corrects errors, Royal Fam rule shit
Now and forever, what
[Timbo King]
Orotorical, niggas is metaphorical
My editorial breaks down your monuments historical
Geologist studyin land, usin the earth's crust
Measurements, eight elements, atomic weight plus density
Hi-Techs, science, thrustal gravity
Revolve around my oro, I'm the soul that keeps spinnin, what
Supernova, black quasar, my mental radar picks up
Frequencies beyond the earth's equator
Forver glow, electro, magnetic force field
Thoughts build, we bomb for real, Royal Fam still exists
Golden fist, your caught up in the devil's mist
Fire war, royal sire laws, reveal this
Protons, electrons, atoms cause explosions
My center of atraction, I'm the nucleus, you're frozen
My square be complete, architectual, visual
The sound spectrum strikes the mental then the physical
My perimeter damns your diameter
Bar codes are scanned from America to Canada
What, from America to Canada
Get your mind ready
[Hook]
[Outro]
Get your minds ready, Get your minds ready, Royal Fam Legacy
What, get your minds ready, get your rhymes ready

Laid back handling hors d'ourves

We too black for BET
You memorize

I'm at the 19th degree
If a civilized person doesn't perform his duty, what shall be done?
Pardon me God, that nigga got a gun
Bulging out his sweatpants, check out his stance
See the side of his grill?
 (
Look like my cousin Lance
Left hand, rocky Guess watch

Yo I think I did his Clarks
He wanted crush bone leather with the strings dark
(
Now I remember
) He from 
Bear Mountain
He and 
Mitch Greene
 
shot the fair one

Seventh round, Chavez bleeding from his right ear
Yo keep your eye on that same nigga from right here
Popcorn spilling all on Liz Claiborne

Yeah, yeah yeah now, what the fuck now?
Flipmode Wu-Tang shit, what the fuck now?
Yeah yeah yeah..
Historical and monumental shit
What the fuck now? Yeah, yeah, yeah
Straight smack a nigga right in the face like this was handball
Or make a mural out his face up on a damn wall
Niggas play hard and shit; if you know what's best for you
Y'all niggas better safeguard your shit
Even though we rep brass knuckle rap
Fuck with street geniuses and bowlegged chicks who walk with a gap
Street niggas now the corporate boss
Still go to y'all resteraunt for steamed fish and Irish moss
And y-yo, the way we do it and you see how my shit bomb
Your whole show wack and I'mma cancel your sitcom
Fuck a nigga broad 'til she tired and real calm
You ain't knowin my name tattoed on your bitch arm
The way we blow SHIT is a shame
Casually bust my gun and celebrate bustin a cork on the champagne
Wrote you with a whole new approach that lead a whole team of niggas
Y'all should know I only ball like a coach, NOW!
[Raekwon the Chef]
Check out the light fixture, 
freak lines like white bitches
Let the mic lines - hang that slang is ridiculous
Emperor of warlords, big gun only fuck with sawed-offs
That's my specialty, more to bust
Shot out my bed parrot keep it gangster Lord
I analyze your work those that got merked were not established
Texture look classy, arm baby 2000 raspberry
S-5, blowin through Asbury
Soon to own steakhouses, glowin like makeover thousand
Them them niggas, robbin from 
Pinkhouse's
Show and prove, knockin off cab drivers
God, 
sodomize money
, 
ring two hundred thousand
See the color of the carved out Wu emblem
Baby, it's all designers, tailor-made Wu gooses
Limousine, automatic new uzi's in 'em yo
Relax, cousin just cruise through, jewels with him
[GZA]
Move up the block, giant box blast my song
Non-stop strictly hip-hop, march on
Doo-rag hang long
, 
metal tape is high-bias
Graphics, captured with the colorful, iris
I zoom in, while the listeners tune in
Some assumin they paid dues and joined the union
Lost nigga couldn't rumble in this wild jungle
Quick to crumble, type to be on the stand and fumble
Divine Master
, threw on the track that made 'em bleed
He produce at unattainable rains of top speed
This powerful magnet, that left 'em stagnant
Was unlikely in cameras in larger fragments
Un-filled rifle, scout sniper, shots precise
Starlight scope, with the night vision device
Splendid marksman, that'll shoot the one off the dice
Split a grain of rice, in one shot we kill 'em twice
{*GUNBLAST*}

Peace God

How you God?
(Studying 120 right now
Call me back at the God Hour)
The Fuck?
It's just the new way of thinking
Light up the broccoli kid
Throw the relish in my back pocket
Keep your eyes open
Push your seat back, just flow
That's how we doing it
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Bound by honest sword take over the set, 
rap from here to Quebec
Throw up the tec, crash your intellect, select a vet
Swimsuit mammal handle, yo every fly vandal go to project
Slam you like Hamill's wife 'fore the scandal
Wally sandal just a sample, my niggas fertilize thoughts
Yo mad support drink a quart then bamboo
One nasty can blew, 
my pen sterile won't perform if I'm not lampable
Asking my man'll get you slapped down, play the anthem
Lit it who wit it champagne get it, that's the ticket
Solid nines sounding like crickets snatching worker shipment
Pull her hair, long dick it, we talk right before we left lifted
Just like a long sleeve, guess who ripped it?
[Chorus: U-God (Raekwon)]
Projects (My niggas survive,

Projects (Try to escape the flying shells, dodging)
New York projects

[Verse 2: Method Man]
Sign of the times, conspiracy to overthrow the mind
Behind every fortune there's a crime
This technique is tec-9
Blast at any Close Encounter of the Third Kind
This be The Evil That Man Do, we dismantle any adversary
Them niggas all thumbs and can't handle my flurry
Hear me, you jam on, you want to scare me
Don't even kid me, shit in my coat aiming at your kidney
Pressure, 
Red Hot like Chilli Pepper
Black 'n Decker, hardware avoid the leper
Five o'clock shadowboxer
, hold down the sector
Bet your bottom dollar
 lecture be hard to swallow
007 mark

the secret agent
That mac's well and gets smart through entertainment
Welcome to 
The Killing Fields

Headbanger boogie niggas going through changes

Verse 3: [Ghostface Killah]
Suck my dick it's the kid with the fat knob
I bust all into your face, plus it come in globs
Quick get on your knees, 
with your sweet pussy let it breathe
Two fingers is all in your hole, think I can fit three
Your pink lips, spread it and shit, let me throw my dick in
Grab my shit and place it gently on your clit
Ping-pong pussy
, wide world the womb
Titties sagging, stomach on some shrivelled up prune shit
Too much air in your pussy you screaming that it's talking you daddy
Fart's breathing out your lips, splashing my dick badly
Use vinegar to try to tighten up your ginger
Almighty dick ran in with a cape, some call him engine
Lightning rod bob, black candy cane attached to God
Thick like a great adventure cigar, in your garage
Pregnant pussy have you fall out, like Remi on the house
Watch the teeth for sobbing my shit
, 
you bit it on the couch
Dry pussy leave the friction burns
, plus beef I hone
The condom broke, 
bitch you got AIDS I'm shaking in my bones

"Execute them" 4x

Yeah, y'all mothafuckers know, turn my shit up mothafucker
Wild the fuck out, word up fuck the radio
1998 word up, whippin illegal on y'all beagle-lookin mothafuckers
Yo, James spin off, slang dames wanna hit off
Check this Slovak lock it down, lames get off
Jury match, range rack, fists of fury-act
Don po, six hundred glow, Wally mack poly like that
It's real ("Execute Them"), diabolical
Logical, strange chokehold, kill is possible
Flip a wig blindfold, rewind the scroll
Clip full-mo, flip on the glow, blow
Rock a arm-fold, tourist a bull report
Sit back, calmful, tibble and cold war
Hailin from my neck down, rounds flip clowns
Buyin a loyal bitch gowns, go down, fuck them clowns
While we healin, minds, wheelin labs wit cathedral ceilings
Dry a hitman for hire, alien flyer
"Slang bang to wax, slang bang to wax, slang slang bang to wax
Torture pack"
What what, step up, throw your sword up
[Masta Killa]
Aiyyo witness the abduction, bill of destruction
Blood rushin, from a universal standpoint
Acknowledge shorties bustin, but they gotta come son
Before they can test my steel
I send a grandson to let em feel one, bodies not worth my gun
Peace Sudan, w-w-MastaKill.com, heavily armed
We roam, through the dark damp litter of the forest
Floor lies dough, 
bless em wit a c-note
, throw em overboat
Slit his stomach so the body won't float
The vigilant, infinite patient I stand as 
commandin chief
Mad burial competitions intense for every inch of the borough
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack, pump it to the max
Till your heart collapse, fully auto rap (2x)"
"Might lose your eyesight, bloodtype, a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
(Execute them) I live to write the hype"
[Inspectah Deck]
Murder verser, twenty bean rap fiend server
Rhymes nurse your mind, bustin like twin burners
Certified lah, five million eyes left wide
Inside we split the grand prize
Won it by a landslide, 
dance by the rest
They bettin contest but they pose no threat
Street corner warrior, cause crowd disorder
And glide like rollerblades 'cross your recorders
Soldier of fortune lost in the madness
Brandish your weapon or get dropped to the canvas
Po' bandit hold the belt single-handed
Most Demanded Assassin is what I'm branded
Far from your standard, universally
Planted jewels in the minds of fools left stranded
One man hit force, my shirt ripped off
Squeeze a full clip to kill the bullshit then I dip off
"Slang bang, slang bang to wax (Execute Them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype"
"Execute them" 2x
"Slang bang to wax, torture pack pump it to max till your heart collapse"
"Sla-slang bang to wax (Execute them)
Torture pack, pump it to the max till your heart collapse (Execute them)
Fully auto rap, might lose your eyesight, bloodtype a-alike
Snake bite, gorge on this mic, I live to write the hype
I live to write the hype"

[GZA (RZA)]
I grew up around block parties ready to rock
Behind the rope nigga with my rhymes on cock
The verse shot first nigga who had shit to pop
A bad weather blow the feathers off a hundred flocks
With 70% goose, 30 ducked, get stuck
And each link in your chain is trucked
No ends in this rhyme cipher with nine snipers
Charge of the kiss from the Pied Piper
I live around DJ's, b-boys, MC's
Through rap never thinkin' +Airways+ are TVs
It was strictly all about magnificant rhyme clout
+Rec Room+, 2 dollars with the flyer as we would doubt
Now his wigs pushed back
Name scratched off the plaque, too wild to re-enact

MC's have the right to remain silent
Everything you say can and will be used against y'all muh'fuckers
And Mef can only trust ya as far as I can see ya
Me need ya? That'll be the.. day, ya busta
It gets no rougher when, me and my comrades rush ya
Like red heat with hammers and sickles
I milk like ya baby mama's nipples, got issues
It's just us, so what's what if any can touch us
Then lord strike me down where I stand at now

Choke you by the throat, the chrome handle smoke

Aiyo, it's like this jumpin' out of golden whips
Flashin' mega bricks, outfits, rock ridiculous whips, bitch
Wavy hair, men of the year, bent in the stairs
Sick winter gear, been on position is where
Call him an Asiatic God-body, +Longevity+
Slang rap, you get your whip wrapped
Swing through the hood calmly
Yo what up? Staten Island, Bush, George
Dust shut shit off, whips spin off
Get off, slips, which, wiz
Mind di-tects mines, lines lick sick nines
Pick wines, lift up, bill a nigga six flies
Dip wide, dress my shit up, fuck six times, wish mine
Rub lamps, take thousand dollar crystalines

Help me Rhonda, help help me Rhonda
[RZA]
This is the Wu-Tang Clan, we wanna bomb ya
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Brothas get petro when Ason appears
When I step into your atmos', here comes the fear
Can I get riggy-diggy-raw, huh? Man!
Who's knows your shields, yes the man I am
Which means I'm clean, another slang on your brain
Forget about all that handy flocks and chains
I'm popular, straight from the opera
I rocks on a nigga cuz I'm about ta
Blow up! With the jaws, the party I'm in there
Ya step to the Shaolin, throw the blunt to the rear
What time is it? It's time to whip the whip
Mad difference to the pockets, feelin legit
Cuz when I come out this way, I don't play
To put a brother away, Chk-BLAOW! Blown away
Give it to ya raw, my style is hardcore
Don't funk the jaw, Wu-Tang jaw
Shit is about to get funky in here
I die for this cuz you're shot when I'm there
Whoever's with me, you better step with me
Right now, if not, another beat down
[Hook 9X: RZA]
The Wu is comin through!
[RZA]
Yo it might sound dramatic, I'm a rap fanatic
The mic is a habit, I gots to grab it
Whipped it, flipped it then I sticked it
Enter my pocket once I've rocked it
Sound is known as the high sin dome
Like smoke from a blunt when it enters the dome
The deliver the method to improve my effort
Of my flow when I got buckwild with the record
MC's laid up, they heard my flavor
Got a bomb whip like my next door neighbor
Never the effect of 28 got me paranoid
Girls are somethin I can't avoid
Gimme gimme gimme, I stay when I'm simmy
But I won't say a gift without somethin on my Jimmy
This is the slicksta when I gets ya sister
Flipped ya, hit her then I'm quick ta
Live New York with a two dime talk
Then who keeps walkin through the Times speed talkin
Those who hit the, flow seems to get ya
Hit you and then Big Prince come and stick ya
And I'll be havin you, runnin up the Avenue
My rhymes that be grabbin you and beats that be stabbin you
Some fail to fuckin voodoo, the drunken monk
If it ain't loud enough, pop ya trunk
[Hook 9X]
[Outro: RZA]
So what you gonna do?
"Wu-Tang crew" -] Ol' Dirty Bastard *cut and scratched a few times*

[Ol Dirty Bastard]
What y'all thought y'all wasn't gonna see me
I'm the Osiris of this shit
Wu-Tang is here forever, motherfuckers
This ninety-seven
Aight my niggas and my niggarettes
Let's do it like this
I'ma rub your ass in the moonshine
Let's take it back to seventy-nine
[Inspectah Deck]
I bomb atomically
Socrates' philosophies and hypotheses
Can't define how I be dropping these mockeries
Lyrically perform armed robbery
Flee with the lottery, possibly they spotted me
Battle-scarred Shogun,
 
explosion when my pen hits
Tremendous,
 
ultra-violet shine blind forensics
I inspect you,
 
through the future see millennium
Killer Bees sold fifty gold, sixty platinum
Shackling the masses with drastic rap tactics
Graphic displays melt the steel like blacksmiths
Black Wu jackets Queen B's ease the guns in
Rumble with patrolmen, tear gas laced the function
Heads by the score take flight incite a war
Chicks hit the floor, die hard fans demand more
Behold the bold soldier, control the globe slowly
Proceeds to blow,
 
swinging swords like Shinobi
Stomp grounds and pound footprints in solid rock
Wu got it locked, performing live on your hottest block
[Method Man]
As the world turns, I spread like germs
Bless the globe with the pestilence
The hard-headed never learn
It's my testament
 
to those burned
Play my position in the game of life standing firm
On foreign land jump the gun out the frying pan into the fire
Transform into the
 
Ghost Rider
A six-pack and a streetcar named desire
Who got my back in the line of fire holding back what
My peoples if you with me where the fuck you at
Niggas is strapped and they trying to twist my beer cap
Is court adjourned for the bad seed from bad sperm
Herb got my wig fried like a bad perm,
 
what the blood
Clot,
 
we smoke pot
 
and blow spots
You want to think twice, I think not
The Iron Lung ain't got to tell you where it's coming from
Guns of Navarone, tearing up your battle zone
Rip through your slums
[Cappadonna]
I twist darts from the heart, tried and true
Loop my voice on the LP,
 
martini on the slang rocks
Certified chatterbox, vocabulary 'Donna talking
Tell your story walking
Take cover kid what
Run for your brother kid
Run for your team and your "six can't rhyme" groupies
So I can squeeze with the advantage and get wasted
My deadly notes reigns supreme
Your fort is basic compared to mine
Domino effect, arts and crafts
Paragraphs contain cyanide
Take a free ride on my thought
 
I got the fashion
Catalogs for all y'all to all praise due to God
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
The saga continues
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang
[U-God]
Olympic torch flaming,
 
we burn so sweet
The thrill of victory, the agony defeat
We crush slow, flaming deluxe slow
For judgment day cometh, conquer it's war
Allow us to escape, hell
 
glow spinning bomb
Pocket full of shells
 
out the sky, Golden Arms
Tunes split the shitty Mortal Kombat sound
The fateful step make, the blood stain the ground
A jungle junkie,
 
vigilante tantrum
A death kiss, catwalk,
 
squeeze another anthem
Hold it for ransom, tranquilized with anesthesias
My orchestra, graceful, music ballerinas
My music Sicily,
 
rich California smell
The axe kill adventure, paint a picture well
I sing a song from Sing-Sing
, 
sipping on ginseng
Righteous wax chaperone, rotating ring kings
[RZA]
March of the wooden soldiers
C-Cypher-Punks couldn't hold us
A thousand men rushing in, not one nigga was sober
Perpendicular to the square
 
we stamp gold like Fleer
Escape from your dragon's lair
 in particular
My beats travel like a vortex through your spine
To the top of your cerebral cortex
Make you feel like you bust a nut from raw sex
Enter through your right ventricle clog up your bloodstream
Now terminal like Grand Central Station
Program fat basslines on Novation
Getting drunk like a fuck, I'm ducking five-year probation
[GZA]
War of the masses, the outcome disastrous
Many of the victim family save they ashes
A million names on walls
 
engraved in plaques
Those who went back received penalties for their acts
Another heart is torn as close ones mourn
Those who stray, niggas get slayed on the song
[Masta Killa]
The track renders helpless and suffers from multiple stab wounds
And leaks sounds that's heard
Ninety-three million miles
 
away from came one
To represent the Nation,
 
this is a gathering
Of the masses that come to pay respects to the Wu-Tang Clan
As we engage in battle, the crowd now screams in rage
The high chief Jamel-I-Reef takes the stage
Light is provided through sparks of energy
From the mind that travels in rhyme form
Giving sight to the blind
The dumb are mostly intrigued by the drum
Death only one can save self from
This relentless attack of the track spares none
[Ghostface Killah]
Yo Yo Yo, fuck that, look at all these crab niggas laid back
Lamping
 
like them gray and black Puma's on my man's rack
Codeine was forced in your drink
You had a Navy green salamander fiend, bitches overheard you scream
You two-faces, scum of the slum, I got your whole body numb
Blowing like Shalamar in eighty-one
Sound convincing, thousand dollar cord by convention
Hands like Sonny Liston
, get fly permission
Hold the fuck up, I'll unfasten your wig, bad luck
I humiliate, separate the English from the Dutch
It's me, black, Noble Drew Ali
Came in threes we like the Genovese, is that so
Caesar
 
needs the greens
, it's Earth
Ninety-three million miles from the first
Rough turbulence, the wave burst,
 
split the megahertz
[Raekwon]
Aiyyo that's amazing, gun in your mouth talk, verbal foul hawk
Connect thoughts to make my man child walk
Swift notarizer
, 
Wu-Tang, all up in the high-riser
New York Yank visor
 
world tranquilizer
Just a dosage, delegate my Clan with explosives
While my pen blow lines ferocious
Mediterranean, see y'all, the number one draft pick
Tear down the beat God, then delegate the God to see God
The swift chancellor, flex the white gold tarantula
Track truck diesel
, 
play the weed God substantiala
Max mostly, undivided then slide in sickening
Guaranteed made em jump like Rod Strickland

[Intro: RZA]
Plush whips and rollies, ice chains and stogies
No bitch could hold me, in this
 
Thug World
[
Inspectah Deck
]
I hold it with the bolo grip, solo control the strip
Behold, P.L.O. the click, man, it's over with
So quick, notice how we bang with the knuckles bare
Wu-Tang
, 
keep it fresh like tupper ware
The Jungle, Animal House, gat in your mouth
Polly with the wild life, cannibal out
Give this five course meal in effect, reel to reel or cassette
Or with the mask on, peelin' the tech
Killah Hill, man, you feelin' my set, feelin' my rep
Annamette with the top down, wheelin' the 'Vette
Scoop me downtown, cop the brown and back to the bids
Twist a blunt in front of Jake and still mash on the strip
Face sick with the rap shit, stacking them chips
In the pits, stick shit, cats packing them grips
Bad bitch with the black six, after my dick
She like, this your pussy, and she smash my click
Not a fake, not a fraud, see my name on the wall
Niggas straight, like an inmate, try'nna make the board
Snake waiting, dudes came for sure, I lay law
Stay raw, 
cause a 'massacre' with no 'chainsaw'
Half y'all talk about it, but you don't want war
See my wolves eat the bones and we still want more
We be foaming at the mouth, even, I doubt we leave without eating
So without reason, pounds are squeezing
The lifestyle of fiends and beans, big dreams and
 
CREAM
Bitches ride like the Scream Machine
For a taste of it, the chick strip
, 
clean out the jeans
Next thing she was smuggling coke between the seams
[Hook: Dexter Wiggles] + (RZA)
If real niggas is listening, the life we living in, is wrong
(
Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable, Witty Wu-Tang is unpredictable
)
Back for transitions, to save us from harm
We in the race for time... so we won't lose our mind
But if we run the race like a thug
We would lose that mind that we made of
[RZA]
You kept the weapon concealed like a magician's secret dollar bill
Liable to pull a knife from out of his heel
Snatch the sword from the rock with one hand
One finger, bzzz, turn ya body to sand
You'll be hoping you'd be Spidey, to get away from this
You be hoping you be whitey when the judge get pissed
One man, can't uplift the land
Like Method Man standing on the hands of fans
See the Captain and Lieutenants, true descendant
Splendid, unprecedented, hip hop vintage
Started from the park benches, before the NARCs could snitch us
He was God Cypher Divine, trying to spark the wizards
[Hook 2X]

"5...4...3...2...1...0"
*explosion*
[Inspectah Deck]
Yea, this is the poisonous, venomous
Killa bee, queen bee connection
Live and direct
Shaolin, BK, QB, Boogie Down, wherever you found
Yo, yo, Deadly Venom is how we end em
Mast avenge em, no friend of him
Bend em in half for enterin
My comrodery move like tight security
Known to tear the club up plus the after party
On the battle field catch a body
With no fair warnin, my queen bee connect swarm on em
Primate, hold your mic straight before you challenge me
Your light weight and only force me to cause casualty
Battery packs catch match mines with the solar powered
They get over powered
Shower with rhymes just like white lines of powder
Feel the realness from bein solo with this crowd here
[Finesse of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, yo, yo, we takin no shorts for sure
Comin through, smash you mother fuckers to floor
Whoever wanted war, yo, bring it
If you got the sword, I'ma swing it
Slither back to the pit when my phone started ringin
Yo, Come here, what's up, niggas rock to get stuck
Niggas runnin through the chamber we ain't givin a fuck
Cuz I'm deadly, I'ma set the pace like a medly
Relay, who could match the venom on the replay
[J-Boo of Deadly Venoms]
Aiyyo, the bitch nice and catch crack like dice
Give em a double order of man slaughter on the tape recorder
Fuck the law and order, tape muffled and distorted
All you heard was murderous shots, the rest was pre-recorded
The jury voted, I'm a free venom, hittin niggas with the momentum
Even villains wanna get up in em
The feelin's devious from the breathious
The way we leavin this is sure to make snakes hiss
[Method Man]
It be I, the most high, fly robin fly
Keep a close eye on Johnny 5, I'll be comin live
]From New York, it's saturday night
So it's only right, I step to the phony types
See em at the party actin hard, but the hardly a threat to the vet
Once you start me, no stoppin, no pardon me
No coppin a plea, I beat you in the head, third degree
What's the science, the 411, can't do me none
Still ghetto, I rhyme ghetto, my brother's ghetto
Never say die and never settle
For anythin less than what the devil posess
I'm like MOP to the death
Now who is Johnny Blaze, Mr. Meth
Mother fuckers
[Chorus: Finesse of Deadly Venoms, (Cappadonna)]
Hittin fever, come with the raw
Deadly Venom meet the Wu, no more to come, now what is left to do
(Ghetto collaborations, such a deadly combination
Face to face, Shakin your earth, rockin your nation)
[Champ MC of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, yo, yo, Sons of fishes rollin with a devious Clan
I got a master plan here to blast your man
Gettin lyrical, fightin your feelin deep in your mental
Like a pencil all in your brain, killin your spiritual
The original, fishin yall, rollin with a bunch of criminals
Street gunner, Venom strike like thunder
This some shit that'll stop your hunger
Ready for war, like me let you get a taste of the raw
Comin through with the Clan so you won't get far
Batters and scars, all respect due to the gods
And my queen killa bees just collectin that cheese
Overseas, gettin ready for the year 2G, DVs
(Poison Clan rocks the world)
[Cappadonna]
(The Pillage!!)
Yo, I'm a great comodity, for see me
The great unchained magnetic
Release mine, fuck yall, piece mine together
To the third power, hit yall like may flowers
Scandal, slash three felonies to be the one six vandal
]From Park Hill, Shaolin put the work in
Dusk do us dawn, Lebanon Don
Don't sleep on the adversary
Mental niggas stalk yall out on the ferry
You got trapped in between pillars
And the venoms, cherry heads are minimum
[N-Tyce of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, yo, yo, projects of elimination
We jack some like Rhythm Nations
Got your hard speed like we drag racin
We lab replacin, but tried to avoid a confrontation
You kind of mixed up like Tiger Woods with that combination
I ain't called no names, here's a hint
Niggas with no names, antique things, gold chains
Do admire the visual, 'bout the coolest Carolina
Individual, 
Everything digital, like Bobby
I'm lovin all them kung-fu flicks, poison em lively
My crew be known to run through cliques
, but fast in a hurry
We I smash, leave your vision blurry
Tryin to make the bill like Murray
[Chorus]
[J-Boo of Deadly Venoms]
Yo, on the french kiss, sour than blood, hotter than piss
You ventriliquist talkin out your ass like this
Cuz I insist that you don't wanna show the tape of the hits
I told yall, I crush yall on the tape like Quake
You tweaky trick, wanna violate, great, Wu and Venom annihilate
Don't hesitate to push the rhymes like weight
You Shake, Jake thing
[Street Life]
Yo, PLO, when the guns blow, you'se a no show, homo
Holdin like a scarecrow with no dough
Street pro's move through the metro
Rapidly my faculty quick to blow the boost out your battery
My african queen bees is backin me, shuttin down your salary
J-Boo twist another Daquiri, fifty steamboat float
Flow on this scenario, hydro thoughts lick off like a callico
[Finesse of Deadly Venoms]
Let's get it on, mic's get blown when you step into my zone
Heads get flown for tryin to clone
I take that, lie you on your back like you wanna go on
For one, there's no part, hold on, like float on
I keep it tight, rip all sides to a square
You ain't seen no thugs like these no where
I swear, you wanna test me, who can it be
Rollin with the Fam, Wu-Tang, DVs
[GZA]
Yo, I dead MC's with this poisonous venom
Return and send em, wack niggas is in em
The secretly analyzed, this shit is live
I see the allies tryin to stalk the bee hive
Forgot the deadly stingin was major bell ringin
Too strong for niggas with eyes closed and slingin
Make your point, spot your target and zoom in
Before its too late, saw the snake through his hand shake
Aimin your darts at a click you can't handle
Attack with the paint stones and travel on camel
A warm sigh as you cross the barrier
But my storm side, will destroy ya area
[Chorus x2]
(Poison Clan rocks the world
Poison Clan rocks the world)

[GZA]
Okay.. the GZA
Tony Touch classic
, knowhatI'msayin?
We gonna bang y'all, in the head one time
Blaze up on y'all one time real fast (Do the mix and all that shit)
Knamsayin, word up (Make it make it a record real quick, do yo' thang)
Throw ya seatbelts on, ahhight?
(Yeah, hook it up, make it a record, get down yo)
I take y'all niggas straight, +Beneath the Surface+
To the core, if it ain't raw its worthless
Pentab professional, hold the ink
While river rats fall off the raft and sink
Tony let a brother Touch, twenty bar rush
The way we push through equivalent to rocket thrust
Allah just
, I lay it for the mix tapes
Quick to quake a label-mate
The sound came outta rusted crate
Surrounded by cobwebs
Beat smooth enough to slide through like bobsleds
On a cold white snow, plus with the right flow
Wu-Tang niggas they shine and make the mic glow
[Masta Killa]
We killin all gorillin with all that screwfacin
Pacin back and forth looking savage, stop it
[RZA aka Bobby Digital]
Whether plugged in or plugged out
Iron grill mugged or thugged out
Blood in or blood out, son was bugged out
Might look at you and slice you
Buck fifty face stupid, the shape of one Nike swoop
Who the fuck you think let y'all wild niggas in
Allowed you to put down ya guns, and raise ya pen
Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig, we don't fuck with no pig
We teach the kids, you rather have a bullet or a word to your wig
Murder rates increases, bullet holes the size of fifty cent pieces
Don't worry about the weed or pussy, I read books
I'm liable to mate'cha king with three rooks
You see the Wu W, raise the black fist
Maybe Tony Touch's concord needle will scratch this
The ice cube link you bought, from the Jew for 80 G's
Was only appraised at 42
Gazed upon by the eyes of multitude
Of people, who would trade gold for food
I heard boar's head killed more than nuclear warhead
Or street serfs who walk around dressed in all red
Bobby Digi said if you ever in Compton or Long Beach
Break my sons Doc Doom and Crisis wit a nice piece
[Masta Killa]
Penetrate on mix tape, with the legislation
Illustrate constant elevation
Spark friction, Shawshank Golden Arm Redemption
Endorsed my the Masta inscription signature
[Inspecta Deck]
Off top my unorthodox style of attack
Is like Hannibal rollin on elephant's backs
Pack a long barrel, bustin off strong ammo
My light so vast I cast twenty foot shadows
First family, fifth cappo, micro to macro
Load it in ya head play it back slow
Act like you know, this is no drill
Murderous rap revealed goin for kill
On these New York city sidewalks we walk
Camoflauge, dodgin the eyes of the hawk
Kani Sport, totin the fifth, slidin off
My live source movin across with brute force
Bloodsport, anymore heads face the blade
Fakers must fade, the stakes are now raised
Words of murder, suspense, and intrigue
Make major league niggas show signs of fatigue
My Killer Bees span wider than seven seas
Squeeze on MC's, with bullet train speed
Tony's touch create more gold than Midas
Ya highness, all in ya head, like ya hair stylist
[Ghostface Killa]
Frosty mug, big ring leaders top secret thug
Lampin in cheaters Orenthal with the murder glove
Boat of the town, devilish grin look peculiar
Swung on this faggot, knocked the windows outta Silvia's
Timb's got scuffed up, my ankles got sprained, that's my word
To every single seed, I smack flames
Staten Island's bayside of teachers of Elijah
Thrown out the temple, now collided wit the father
Nickname's Pudding, Clarence 13X before the Will Smith's
And the limelights of Cuba Gooding
Lost in the cosmos, explodin through a quasar
Be duckin pulsars, organic state still be the Gods
Tony Touch, Tony Touch
Word up
Big Face Ghost in effect

[Intro]
If only we can lay our hands on that vixen Yu Shin Hua
Then all our problems will be over...
Yu Shin Hua!
[Hook]
You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
[Verse 1: RZA]
The quintessence
, 
father of the hip hop renaissance
My slang been around before baton and Benetton
I've been on, fingerprint, two finger tips
So when I squeeze the rubber grip, release the clip, then leave the clip
C-Cypher
 Pigs can't identify it
The true and living God, son, we exemplify it
The most complicated 'formance of life, we simplify it
Bzzz, don't knock it til you try it
Flying dagger, make 'em stagger, then I take a swagger
Ice cold Jägermeister,
 
take a drag of
Humboldt County kush
, 
slide like the Nike swoosh
Bruce Almighty got more problems than Spidey, look
Old Brooklyn, Putnam Avenue crook, I've been tooken
All around the world, rooked it then, drive back in Brooklyn
Good looking, son, yo, son, bring the hook in
You can never find Zig weak spot, stop looking
[Hook (x2)]
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
From the continents to Croatia, I'll flame a lamester
With the new slang, much more to show ya
These rocks change, Glock fully, hot pellets
Have me running through the hall, it's on, 
like you being chased by the relic
Can't nothing harm me, yo, I move through any project
With logic, few semi's, hide in the cockpit
Scream out, Shallah and I'mma tap in, 
harder than Tinactin
Don't try to play the fella, I'll blacked in
Moving all miraculous, the slap smiths of the rap game
Say my name backwards, you'll get back changed
Black man, black hooded, moving through the city
Like you Batman, still you so pussy, like Catwoman
Don't bother the Legion, more squeezing, more reason
To light a new block up, cause me to cement shit
Powerful block shoppers and all niggas getting that guac
Dare you to try to find my weak spot
[Hook (x2)]
You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
Verse 3: GZA
I stay on the 64 squares, while controlling the center
Trading space for material, the time zone I enter
It's calculated by movement, from pushed pieces
Advances in development, once the pawn reaches
The 8th ranked, now heavily armed with a tank
My opponent's base is threatend, soldiers cut with shanks
Moved all my small pieces, MC's are driven back
Unable to avoid capture from the attack
Such movement, is naturally quite unsound
Men is badly placed upon dangerous grounds
Loosening their position, before they were strongly posted
Before the double rooks had approached it
They must've been quick to ignore the principles
Rock a V and an effective God is invincible
A strategic plan, just the way I envisioned it
Many fallen soldiers in complete imprisonment
[Hook (x4)]
You thought you'd find my weak spot, but still, you failed
[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I tell you, right, right, right, in ya muthafuckin' face
Muthafucka, you know, well, you know muthafuckin' well
When -- we don't play that shit, or, I don't play that shit
That's just Wu-Tang, you know, I'm the nigga
That -- that, give it to ya raw
When I said "first thing first, man, you fucking with the worst
I be sticking pins ya head, like a fucking nurse
I'll attack any nigga who slack in his mack
Come fully packed with the fat rugged stack
Shame on you, when you step through to
The Ol' Dirty Bastard straight from the Brooklyn Zu"

.. {*jail interlude*} ..
[RZA]
Son I just slapped my bitch
Came to my crib 'bout half past six
Kid's in shitty diapers, no food was fixed
I was like, "Yo bitch - why ain't no food fixed?"
She on the phone with her friend talkin bout dick
I snatched the receiver from that bitch like CLICK
She got all excited, tryin to throw fit
Swung at me then I swung back - BITCH!
[Method Man]
What you in fo'? It happened in the club
With some thugs I was at the bar, smokin bud, hollerin at love
Ladybug was playin in my peachfuzz, she was
Talkin hot fudge, can't nobody do it like she does
In the hot tub - didn't know her man was in the club
And honey dove never mentioned that she had a scrub
It must have been the drugs or the alcohol buzz, had me
Shootin my game like a thirty-eight snub baby
Let's cut a rug, that's when I felt a shove
What the blood do - actin like he won the Golden Gloves
I get one for holdin grudge, but if this kid throw a slug
I'mma throw a slug - that's how we be rollin cuz
I see this dud tryin to play me like a pair of Lugz
Big John Stud, Goldschlager in a golden mug
What you in fo'?
.. {*jail interlude*} ..
[Streetlife]
I'm locked down for tryin to hold my block down since a shorty
The Old Earth was like, "Street put the Glock down"
I was raised in slums, love how the gun sounds
And now I got one - c'mon, who wanna front now?
Sunup to sundown, ready for showdown
Whoever wanna throw down, the gangsters better slow down
Wake up, before you be in a cell with forty of us
(What you in fo'?) In for murder over money love and lust
(What you in fo'?) In for life, don't let me tell you twice
I might bang you twice and take double the life
What you in fo'?
[Raekwon the Chef]
Jail status - get up
Wash a nigga mattress faggot, you heard about me right?
Pass off them packages cat, you gotta eat to live
Meet the crib; got a hundred starvin niggas in here big
So pop off, drugs that's props, bring in
Glocks we call 'em oxes
Be a real live nigga, swing mops and shit, take over shit
Fuck the C.O.'s, aiyyo Boo, I need clothes
Slide brokers where phones get hid
Fuck with Russians and Latins
The most powerful marble black slipper style
Goin out thrashin niggas, kicks get thrown
Big sizes, sleep in your boots, 4000 rugged F Troops
Notarized wigs, lay six months
That's alright dog, make it home Lord
Heard you admit it in the box, slid it under walls
Bang monster anger
Bop through the halls with bangers
Live God like the Abbot of all chambers..
.. {*jail interlude*} ..

Fuckin around, its that the fuckin clown?
40 Cent? (uh-huh)
If you real thing, cuz you was here
You'll be fuckin dead, you hear me cock-sucker, DEAD!
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, yo, yo
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Crook with a deal
Keep talkin, you gon' meet a crook with a steel
You really want beef, I'mma hand you war
Got big guns, shit you never seen before
Just a no-name nigga, seekin the rep
'bout to take aim, spit a hot flame in your chest
Although everythin was cool, had to start wildin
Front all you want, but not on Shaolin
Point blank, simple and plain, you small change
Tear you up out of the frame from close range
Fake 50 Cent tryin to face the best
Wanna impress me? Let me see you fake your death
Until then, you herb, don't deserve respect
What possesed you? Who gave you the nerve to flex?
God bless you, I'mma lay your soul to rest
Think about it next time you'll pose a threat
[U-God]
2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that
[Inspectah Deck]
So you wanna stick the Gods for they funny-ass rings?
How dare you?
 Clip your wings and straight aim
You be careful, how you mention the name
Speaks codes, I violate your clan like parole
Who want it? Run in your lab without a warrant
What you gon' do now? Got your ass cornered
Feel a squad closing in, from all angles
Hit you, split you from your ass to your ankle
Let my dogs eat your food, hear my wolves howl at the moon
Lock down your body, leave the room
You fake fuck, wanna start with us?
Anybody ever told you, you talk too much?
Niggas want mine, I'mma put five on your bucket
Shine on the wrist, cost more than your budget
Who you? Face it, your whole camp doo-doo
Wanna get it on, nigga do you, fake fuck
[U-God]
2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, I lay long enough, for you cowards to eat
It's time to apply pressure, devour
 the streets
Yo, it seems another crab, like runnin his mouth
Where he at? Point him out, and I'm callin him out
Make his chick nod the head like she's suckin me off
Keep it raw, meat combat with the dog, dustin me off
No joke, you ain't never seen gun smoke
Nickel pump bastard, stick to playin jump rope
Who the bosses? Power like thoroughbred horses
With more guns than armed forces
You ain't ready, overnight joker
Strip you like poker, your bullshit's over
Give it to me raw, I want mine the foul way
Small change in this game, nigga like a child's play
Motherfuckin coward
[U-God]
2x
Who the hell is 50 Cent? Cornball frontin
'nother studio thug, ain't hurtin nothin, nigga
And your raps ain't built for that
On the real, niggas get killed for that
[Inspectah Deck]
Fuckin 40 Cent
4 dimes and a nickel, God
I challenge you, thats right
Fuckin cheesy boy
Cream Team niggas see you boy
You better have your shit out
You better have your shit right, nigga
YouknowI'msayin?
We the flavoury niggas
We fuckin flavoury niggas
You fuckin coward
Trying to come in this shit
You know I'm sayin'?
We out here, you just small change

[Intro: Raekwon] + (samples)
(Make me yours) He get out of line, break his fucking arm...
You know how it go (What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah)
You know, word up, not playing the games, with these niggas, man
(Somebody tell me what do I do...)
None at all, man... hit 'em off, none of that, man
[Raekwon]
Aiyo, jump out the Acura, crazy heavy, what's popping?
Us locking the game, word to every hand on the 
locman
Street gwop, everybody eats, sweep blocks
This is a message, ain't go no grams, we gon' beatbox
Study like lessons, niggas in the game biting the grain
You knowing where it came from, stop it
You thought we wasn't coming? You dumbing, you blunted again
Watch Lex get that dough out ya pocket, rhyme all 'pallegic
Can't nothing move when I rhyme, when I drop lines it's law out in Egypt
Love ups, don't need no batteries now, what?
The only niggas that'll glow'll be us
Yo, throw me in Sin City, leave me with the vultures and bats
Then give me two weeks to bubble like Kim titties
Dirt Dog, we miss you, now it's time to murder the game
Cuz if things change, you know it ain't against Wu
[Hook 1.5X: sample]
What am I supposed to say? Yeeaaah
Somebody tell me what do I do...
[GZA]
We keep it hot, keep the heat on the block
We never stop, drawing water up until it begin to drop
Raining with the patchwork of puzzles
That was written in the year of the dragon
More raw than you could ever imagine
How much of a great blessing to a rap city
Where the youth is organically fed
, from the 
Witty
Unpredictable, Talent And Natural Game
 is lyrical
Analyze the picture, the portrait, the visual
A Cuban Link Chef cooks spaghetti that's untied
RAGU nigga whose tomatoes are sundried
He gave y'all niggas whiplash from bling bling
But my rhyme'll give ya hot flash and moodswings
Math shed light on divine secrets, then science leaked it
For the lower level creatures that can't peep it
I observe MC's, regardless
From a neighboring world which is ten times the sharpness...
[Hook]
[Masta Killa]
Let the track wind and ya mind flow free
Remain conscious on this ride to ya best ability
Infinity, back to the source of which it came
Energy, see it change forms, atoms being born, never ending
On and on and on and, travel with me
Not trying to convince the pack, that it's a fact
For those who can't adapt, I lived it, shitted it back
We have agreed, you'll feel the impact of the truth when I'll squeeze
The brain feels something pop, hip hop, locked in texts
Fat checks, fly whips, jewelry, chicks
Enough kicks, fitted crown, buttoned down
Underneath the white T lies the four pound
This is forty-five minutes of menacing
Dismantling, any MC opponent stepping in the zone
Get ya face blown (Get ya face blown)
[Hook]
[Inspectah Deck]
Observe the word, when I speak, get the truth's heard
True to the curb, Wu classic is the new birth
Spreading the blessing across seven continents
Arm of the trench, there's no form of defense
Entertainment, nine swords swing rapid
Check the techniques, first bow to The Abbott
Witty Unpredictable, gritty individual
Valid, if it's Actual, Talent and it's Natural
Game
, rugged like the train, pump it in ya vein
I and I ride or die under the name
W-U, the primary, ya secondary
Definitely not necessary
, the legendary
You printed the blueprints to do this shit
Moving the youth in the bricks
Spit poison tipped darts that rip hearts
Through the chest, when I manifest my sick art
[Method Man]
Speaking my mind, fall in line when I spit mine
Still in my prime, still'll shine til it quit time
If this is a crime, find me guilty, I'm so sublime
So rapid with rhymes, sayin' I'm slacking is assonine
Revealing the truth, catching feelings, it's still the Wu
Gorilla the booth, body armored, them killa proof
In living proof, I'm the Wittiest Unpredictable
Most Talented rap muthafucker you ever listened to
[Cappadonna]
I'm a hustler, I grind til my pack is done
Give a seed mad knowledge til they crack and run
Can't nobody fuck with me, I'm just too nice
Smack niggas in they head everytime I write
Yo, I'm straight from Park Hill where the guns is popping
Where them little black kids do they grocery shopping
Go to school fucked up, it's Africa Island
We poor in the bricks but inside it's nothing but talent

[RZA]
Yo Yo Yo doodododododo Yo pssh yo
Yo park the Jeep on the street of the Sunset Marquis
Autograph sign and pass wit a gold tip Sharpie
Permanent ink blots, 
I'm drunk on Red Label scotch
All you faggots try to judge my shit like Ed Koch
Underground left and right pair surround sound can't be scared
Plea the amps, video tape, steady cam
Golden chrome, desert eagle never left at home
Flip the track of the beat, watch Bobby flip the metronome
High voltage, keep my seed and wiz well-cultured
Peal enemies, my melon dim, the poison blue postage
I open and fold ya, Dirty fucked the ogre
I leave the cats the book of food stamps and that poga
The box of evil, a fifty sack of that lethal
Adjust these boots and bloody cube steaks from keebu
[Hook 4X: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
What party can you go to
And I ain't there you bitches actin like you don't care
[RZA]
You bitches actin like you dont care
You bitches actin like you YO
Razor blade toenails cut holes inside tube socks
Golden platinum things unstainable, I chew rocks
Cybertech digital suit deflect bullets
Black hooded surrounded by forty acres of wooded
Land, like my cousin dusty dirty ass Dan
Fucked the daughter of the leader of the Ku Klux Klan
Tapes we dub, pound you wit the ace of club
Poppin your tree to a shrub
Tongue kiss a lion then kidnap her cub
Passionate portrait, my biz spread eagle, wild orchid
Pussy so wet you could fuck it wit a soft tipped dick
Tickle the tonsil you could hear her coughin
I don't know if Dirt fucked Mariah, but I'm out to fuck Tyra
Starks might fuck Mya
[Break: Ol' Dirty Bastard over RZA "doodododododo"ing]
I'm the pussy vampire
I don't wanna work no more
I want my own island
Chorus
[Ghostface Killah]
Yo I'm bent out three days two nights yo I'm spent out
One hell of a cruise New York got they hand out
Like I owe somethin, check they stance they frontin
I'm two seconds from twistin y'all shit over nuttin
All a sudden ice grills kid you did a baby bid
In the mix, almost hung yourself, slit ya wrists
To the maximum, hand me the forty I'll thrash 'em
Split out, guess who gassed 'em, made Ghost throw his mask on
Trauma the block pro, bar sledge slang ho
Runnin from two-inch soles, some rap and I might blow
World Cup, some been blessed wit the Stanley
Ivan Lendl lend you autographed racket wit the hankey
Sideline manuever, polished wack MC remover
Niggas wit long nails cuttin me, leavin bruises
Cantelopes, tied a thousand on y'all folks
Came home, this dusthead dude tryin to play me close
Sweepin, peep fears, Liz wants to chop in this kid
I might do magic make him disappear
Rear-rose that nigga, Isotola Coca-Cola holder
Snap the granola, sprinkle ginko bola
Venom from a cobra, laced in the cummy ball odor
Soaked through a strainer, here's a dose of
The King James version, displayed just like Samsung
Wit effects that'll kill Rogers 007
Hanna Barbera, heart's the opposite of Bambi the deer
Fuck wit mics like Sonny and Cher
Or maybe the Captain & Tennille, immaculate golden seal
Nice like Mr. Whittendale your girl Chippendale
Shallah Price all up in ya dogged-out trench
When I snatched that, shit was broke shoulda sent ya ass back
And where's the key to the hatchback, pop that
Get in throw a bag full of mic's in there, respect that
[Girl - repeat 2X]
What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there
These niggas actin like they don't care
What party can you go to, and Wu ain't there
These hoes actin like they don't care

[Hook: George Clinton]
The fox, is kinda foxy, Mr. Wolf he's the guy
Who chased Red through the woods and ate Grandma
But a dog is a dog is a dog is a dog
Unlike the wolf, who made a widower of Grandpa
[U-God]
Yo, must I flex my cash, to sex yo' ass
I wet the Ave. when I set my path
The 'Vette don't crash, I'm built to long last
Grab my money clip, I hit the bong fast
Earn my respect, my checks they better cash
Finger on the trigger with my nigga Fred Glass
Knuckles is brass,
 start snuffin you fast
Jumpin outta cabs, grabbin money bags
Next shot go right through your hovercraft
You do the math my acid tongue slash
When will you learn it's return of Shaft
The genuine thriller, the Miller Draft
My force might blur, the Porsche'll purr
The apple martini, of course it's stirred
I'll do the honor,
  
the Shaolin bomber
Shark skin armor, I'll bring the drama
[Hook]
[Method Man]
Damn, defecatin' on the map
Wu-Tang takin it back, no fakin in the rap
How real is that, cause niggas hatin on the fact
That the kid is blazin this track and hatin on 'em back
My dough's stacked up with O's
, who the mack
Duckin po'-po's 
blowin smoke O's in the 'Llac
To be exact, don't want no hassle with the stack
In the Big Apple, we the rotten apples in the back
Yeah, it's all grillin, how the fuck y'all feelin?
Non-stop park killin, on the block we was killin 'em
The arch villans, when the blood start spillin
Any stuck start squealin, body bags we was fillin 'em
Yeah, now I got it in the smash
Ounce of marijuana and 
a llama in the dash
Me and my comrades followin the cash
And livin e'ry day like tomorrow is the last
[Hook]
[Interlude: George Clinton]
I'm like the St. Bernard to ya baby when you're lost out in the snow
Like a coyote out on the desert...
Where the foxes never go
And the wolf, they never go...
[Masta Killa]
Yo, would you recognize a jewel for what it is when you see it
Or would you take it for somethin else and get to' the fuck up
Men come together for the common cause
To beat yo' ass, just because
There's a line you don't cross offendin the boss
While of course his one selectin through your head shot
I'm back in the yard again, the bars callin
15 sets of this will have you swollen
Ladies like, "Damn papa you lookin right
I'd love to give you some of this pussy and I'm a dyke"
I write when the energy's right to spark friction
DJ cuttin it, spinnin it back mixin
Great pop knock tickin, poetry description
For the motion picture reenactment
Activate a hired assassin, keep it classic
Rap evolution every black, yo pass that
[Hook]
[Interlude]

[Popa Wu]
These things just took over me
Just took over my whole body
So I can't even see no more
I'm calling my Black woman a bitch
I'm calling my peoples all kinds of thing that they not
I'm lost brother, can you help me
Can you help me brother, please
[Uncle Pete]
You see what we did, we lost the love
I'm talking bout the love, the love of your own
[Popa Wu]
But brother, but brother, but brother, check this out
I still don't understand man, I'm all high off this shit man
[Uncle Pete]
Well, what I'm trying to say my brother
Why, why do we kill each other
Look at our children, what kind of a future
[Popa Wu]
This is the training that's gonna be given to you by the Wu
Brothers and sisters
The revolution, the revolution will be televised, televised, televised
It's time to rise, and take our place so we can inherit the universe
The planet Earth belongs to God
This is nineteen-ninety-seven
Every square inch of it that he chose for himself, is the best part
Behind every strong woman you'll find a strong man
And behind every strong man you'll find a strong woman
The universe is not completed without the sun, moon and stars
(Want to be free)
That's man, woman and child
To all you fake-ass niggas who think you gonna survive out here
Without your Black woman, you're wrong
They have attraction powers on the planet
We are original man, the Asiatic Black man
The maker, the author, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization and daughter of the universe
The population was seventeen million, with the two million Indians
Making a total of nineteen million, four billion, four hundred million
All over the planet earth
(Mandela, Mandela)
Arise you Gods, it's the time for the revolutional war
(Malcolm X, Malcolm X)
That's the mental war
That's the battle between God and devil
Take the devil off your plane
Take him off your mental mentality, take him off your brain
Leave all the cigarettes and guns, the alcohol and everything
Thats the mental devil that exists within your body
That's destroying and decaying your mind
The mind controls the body
Everything within must come out
Don't look towards the sky cause there's no heaven above
Don't look down beneath your feet, there's no hell below
But heaven and hell exist within
Heaven is what you make it and hell is what you go through
[Uncle Pete]
There is only one God
There is a whole new one, faith
There is a only one
One revolution yeah
[Popa Wu]
At one time it was told to me
That man came from monkeys
That we were swinging from trees
I hardly can believe that unless I'm dumb, deaf and blind
You ever heard about, the ape man and the ape woman
You have a mankind, that has a beginning to him
And his ending, is about to come
[Uncle Pete]
If you take one step, I will take one with you
Through the storm and pain, swim the deepest sea, with you my brother
I know you got to be strong, gotta hold on
[Popa Wu]
Now the story is about to close
It was a hundred percent of us
That came on the slave ships
Eighty five percent of our people was uncivilized
Poison animal eaters
They're slaves of the mental powers
They don't know who the true and living God is
And their origins in the world
So they worship what they know not
And they're easily lead in the wrong direction
Ought to be lead in the right
And now you got the ten percent who are rich slave makers of the poor
Who teach the poor lies that make the people believe
That the all mighty true and living God is a spook in the sky
And you can't see him with the physical eyes
They're also known as blood suckers of the poor
And then you got the five percent
Who are the poor righteous teachers
Who do not believe in the teachings of the ten percent
Who is all wise and know who the true and living god is
And teach that the true and living god is a supreme being black man from Asia
Otherwise known as civilized people
Also Muslims, and Muslim's sons
Peace we out
[Cut to Kung-Fu clip]
I have given it much thought
It seems, disaster must come
At best, only postponed
Shaolin Kung-Fu
To survive must now be taught, to more young men
We must expand, get more pupils
So that the knowledge will spread

[Intro 1]

We Usually Take All Niggas Garments
Save your breath before I bomb it

Now lo and behold another deadly episode
Bound to catch another fucking charge when I explode

If I die, my seed'll be ill like me
Approaching me, yo out of respect, chops your neck

So clear the way, make way, yo! Open the cage
Peace, I'm out, jetting like a runaway slave

Yo, there's no place to hide as I step inside the room
Dr. Doom, prepare for the boom
Bam! Aw, man! I, slam, jam, now scream like Tarzan
I be tossing and flossing my style is awesome
I'm causing more family feuds than Richard Dawson
And the survey said, you're dead
Fatal Flying Guillotine chops off your fucking head
MZA, who was that?
 Ayo, the Wu is back
Making niggas go Bo! Bo! like I'm Super Cat
Me fear no-one, oh no, here come
The Wu-Tang shogun, killer to my eardrum
[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Put the needle to the groove I gets rude and I'm forced
To fuck it up
, 
my style carries like a pick-up truck
Cross the clear blue yonder, sea to shining sea
I slam tracks like quarterback sacks from L.T
Now why try and test the Rebel INS?
Blessed since the birth, I earth-slam your best
Cause I bake the cake, then take the cake
And eat it, too
, 
with my crew while we head state to state
[Bridge: All]
And if you want beef, then bring the ruckus
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with
Straight from the motherfucking slums that's busted
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck with
[Interlude: RZA]
Hah! Lebonon, step up, boy!
Represent! Chop his head off, kid!
[Verse 3: Method Man]
The Meth will come out tomorrow
Styles, conditions, bizarre, bizarro
Flow, with more afro than Rollo
Coming to a fork in the road, which way to go? Just follow
Meth is the legend, niggas is sleepy hollow
In fact I'm a hard act to follow
I dealt for dolo, Bogart coming on through
Niggas is like "Oh, my God, not you!"
Yes, I come to get a slice of the punk and the pie
Rather do than die
, 
check my flavor, coming from the RZA
Which is short for The Razor
, who make me reminisce true
Like déjà vu! 
I'm rubber, niggas is like glue
Whatever you say rubs off me sticks to you
[Hook x4]
[Outro: RZA]
Ahh-hah! Yeah
Representing Brooklyn, Queens
Long Island, Manhattan, Bronx
The Rugged Lands of Shaolin
Niggas from Virginia, Atlanta
Our boys in Ohio
Coming through with the crazy Y-O Y-O
Yo, niggas from The Source
My man Kelly Woo from the Gavin
Will Strickland,
 
Jason Staton, yeah
True, true, my nigga Crown what's going down, boy?
We ain't nuttin ta fuck wit
The whole Texas mob, the Chicago mob
Niggas from Detroit, 
fucking California squadron
Coming through you know what I'm saying?
The whole fucking West coast
To the whole East, niggas from D.C
Down in Maryland, 
all the way over there in Morgan State
Wu-Tang Clan ain't nuttin ta fuck wit
All over the whole fucking globe, coming through boy
Peace to the fucking 
Zulu Nation
Peace to all the Gods and the Earths
,
 word is bond
Wu-Tang slang, chopping heads boy
It ain't safe no more! Peace

[
Inspectah Deck

Another sound boy dyin

Don't let the fuzz slide in, bust out the sirens
Sure win, 
lure em in like exotic women
I smile with the sinister grin to finish him
You [fuckin] with Hoodz, get your goods pushed back
You fraud, pull the wool off your Hollywood act
Throw your body on the tracks, pull the back out your raps
Burn like, the human torch, lookin for collapse
It's the intricate, syndicate, thoughts travel infinite
Thunderous, movin hundreds, we on the run [shit]
[Chip Banks]
Who bring that Harlem World Willie [shit] the best, we know
New Jack City 2, Banky B. Nino

Put a dime in the front, I'm off to slide pipe through
[Method Man]
Yo, it's us, the Cold Crush, ice [niggas] plush
Baby what, peep the black dust, diamond in the rough
Give a [fuck],

Long John Silver, the God on your block like God-zilla
*RRAWWARRR* She gave away my [pussy] I'mma kill her
Chorus: Raekwon
Aiyyo, spit for me, hear me, Cream Team
Wake these [niggas] up they ain't hear me, promotin on Leary

[Killa Sin]
Aiyyo I keep my [shit's] raggety, pants saggy, millionaire faculty
Backin me up, knee deep for casualties, speak brief
Thoughts like a street sweep

And spaz out, bitch smack your majesty
Iron palm drillin through your cavity, you want it Dunn how badly
Got eighty cats, creepin in your alley, where your dogz at?
Chorus: Raekwon
Yo, take time out, hold your nine out

Fuck around get wiped out, mic fightin on the kite now

[Hook: Kung Fu samples]
You would do anything to get all of the Wu-Tang sword styles!
The Wu-Tang sword style (2X)
[RZA]
Yo, enter the dragon,
 the kid I'm for baggin
Whip them now it's time to start raggin
Victim's two for this if they got the proper
Step up please to play the Ra, shut
Head first that's the wrong blow to throw
Jump fit now step what you dead
You arouse the anger, the Wu-Tang slanga
That diga-diga-danger
Just go on the issue and make me wanna get a tissue
Dismiss you, put it to your head and dismiss you
For your weak rhyme proposal, I just froze you
Cuz you chose to play me for a softy
I freeze so many MC's they ought to call me frosty
Not sho man, no man is a slow man
I be makin dough like the Pillsbury dough man
And burnin MC's is all natural
Be like cabby and go up and laugh at you
And while he laughin I be bombin
Calmin, alarmin sound that be bombin
MC's like a group of Killa Beez
No one in the world make rhymin trilogies
Slick majestic but you can past the
Prince Rakeem
 is the Wu-Tang Master
[Hook 4X]
[RZA]
Kick to the tragic, rabic, tactic of rappin
You bastard and prepare your casket
Death is the finally step when y'all step
To intercept the rep of the brother who has kept
His status, stop the madness, that is
I'm not the gladest, the baddest
The phattest but Rakeem is the cleanest
But Rakeem is the CREAM when it comes to my team
Know what I mean?
Past imperial, bust my itereria
I blow from Bolivia to Nigeria
Just to know that black, y'all could know that
Me bein wack is like naps on Kojack
Non-existent, ya keep ya distance
You wanna battle? Bring assistance
Proxy, moxy, groups of troupers
Pullin super duper, wanna step to ya
Pass the stereo, king with the venerial
Here's the imperial I fucked up my stereo
You pop your Glocks and watch the Fort Knox
Why not? I got flavor like Dr. Butterscotch
You can't hang with the slang I register
Now you wanna make a replica but you could never past the
Prince Rakeem, the Wu-Tang Master
[Hook to fade]

[Intro: Masta Killa]
My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
My seeds grow and his seeds marry his seeds
That's how we keep Wu-Tang forever, baby
[Verse 1: Masta Killa]
It's good to see the Wu-Tang family under one roof
We celebrate, toastin' shots, Ciroc 40 proof
Burgers on the grill and fried fish
The wiz made potato salad, greens for a side dish
Cold water, mill and reminisce with cousins and sisters
Children on the grass playin' ball and Twister
Fresh lemonade is made
, 
we playin' spades
My nephews turn the livin' room into an arcade
Aunt's cherry baked pie
, 
surprise
, 
Johnny showed up
You can tell from the smell in the air, somethin' rolled up
It's love, peace and happiness, with the joy and laughter
Camera phones flashes, the moment is captured
[Bridge: The O'Jays]
It's so nice to see all the folks you love together
Sittin' and talkin' 'bout all the things that's been goin' down
[Verse 2: Method Man]
It's goin' down
We rock all in together now, Wu-Tang forever now
Twenty years later we still bang whatever now
Turn change to cheddar
If I could take a quote from Obama, change is better
I vow to never let you down
Remember Meth Tical?
In my circle haters was never 'round
I'm a boss, hold that together loud
Reunited
, 
the whole world excited
Wu-Tang is for the kids and people and girls invited
[Hook 2: The O'Jays]
Family reunion
Got to have a family reunion
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together
I wish grandma could see
The whole family
I sure miss her face
And her warm and tender embrace
[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah]
I miss my grandmother, my auntie and
 
Unique Ason
I knew Dirt was high when he had that face on
Fangs hangin' out his mouth, his fronts was golden
Wildin', record execs can't control him
He said ish like me and Mariah
Hit me, woah-woah-woah, that's fire
Still no matter what we gon' rep the name
Look at your family, we got twenty years in the game
[Hook 2: The O'Jays]
A family reunion
Gonna have a family reunion ooh, ooh
Family reunion
It's so nice to come together
To get together
[Outro: RZA]
Aye yo
I'd like to make a toast to my Wu-Tang family
All over the globe
East coast, west coast
All my brothas in the hood keepin' it good
Peace to the Gods and Earths
All my Latino brothers
My Asian brothers, my Caucasian brothers
Wu-Tang Forever

[Verse 1: Method Man]
Apocalypse Now
, 
mind over matter
Next batter be 
Tical
, 
put it on a platter
How much uncut raw shit we dealing with?
Murder track what? Slang killing it, touched
You feeling it in your bloodstream
Deadly Venomous elixir
 
hammer like Sledge that be Sister
All In Together Now
, 
follow me the Mister
Mef
 
Candyman
: 
Farewell to the Flesh
Death come in the scripture, 2001
Bring the rap Armageddeon, let it be known
When you walk up in this Dead Zone
, 
with all that wack shit
Now you know you dead wrong, one thousand lashes
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Detonate that, pussy Massengil rap cleanse that
The kids rank
, 
snatch collars off while riding off
Float boat big boys, 
Oakland A's stashed away blades
Ventilation
 
let the sharks Animaze
Something shiest like seven butcher knives
Rolling Rover style twice, 
finger itchy like lice
, hair fell out
Something to conquer, stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Ring rocky like fuck switch sides like water rides
The DAT bubble life preserve the other guys
Now fuck y'all act wilder
The style wilder than a praying mantis, chilling like *long inhale*
[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
As my brothers and I reign rebellious, changing
The courses of time, devils no longer exist
As 
God Cipher Divine
, 
all minds one, no question
Now check it
Perhaps we can go through Lessons
Or might shot me a pussy protesting
Coming with that lip professing, you must take Allah for fool
Where's his Jewel?
 
Was he using Mathematics as a tool?
Tell me, the struggle is God and
 
I came to build
Shit is so real, inside you distilled
Back in the form of mist
, 
you wishing you did the Knowledge
Before speaking, seeking, where you went wrong
And why would I bring you such physical harm?
[Verse 4: Inspectah Deck]
Mind arson, my squadron surround
 the 
SoundGarden
Guns for hire plus you under fire and a target
Sniper in the cypher, 
I Pied Piper
Move the housing by the thousand, I watched out the Chrysler
Bombs strike ya like the Mighty Thor
, blast the door
Recite a page like a tidal wave crash the shore
Two pulls, I'm wild like mechanical bulls
Pack a full house, it's girls night out, pull a handful
Heavenly laced, stimulation make it feel slow paced
I motivate and await my sober state
[Verse 5: Ghostface Killah]
Magnificent, heavenly the God stay bent
Five Percent
, 
Range whipping
, Soul Controller of the lynch
Macking phone rings, Stephen King drama down at Danzine
My mood swings, 
suplexed off the rope
, magazine
Coconut juice, walnut coloured shoe, ninth annual
Moses lost his sandal hiding the manual
Blowing evangel 
bugging off of Bon Jovi hits
Grandma Lowvey, famous murder weapon was a trophy
Seeds posing in 
Osh Kosh
, guzzle Grolsch
Sabotage massage rap bandit at large
Wolverine Carnation Milk, 
Wu denim jeans
Thurston Howell the Third
, kid's back on the scene
Call it chopped meat cause every word is choppy
Malachi crunch all crows to death, 
Kobayashi couldn't stop me
Getting caught up in my world, Häagen-Dazs swirl
Back flip and then a twirl, cave your whole world in

Now how does one run smoothly after getting an ex
No more asking y, but I guess its on to the next
Abc’s messed up cause u and I were the best
Still have all that love in me, I gotta confess
Relationships are dumb with no you -done with em
Now I got so many things to prove- a ton of em
Like how I love your smile
And the feeling of your touch
Please stay for a while
Im not asking for much
On the phone late at night
Your voice makes me comfortable
I read of love at first sight
“how can one be gullible”
Then I saw you
Damn that chic is lovable
My heart started beating
Im in love
Im in trouble
Flirty text messages
Trying to be subtle
Hugs turned to kisses and
Kisses turned to cuddles
Not much for me to do
This I was prepared for
Here to say I love you still
Girl you got me airborne
2X- Chilling here in the atmosphere that’s where your love takes me
Push me away, got nothing to say, I want you back, you’re my baby
Sorry if your listening
And think that this is corny
The thought of you takes me away
I wish you would of warned me
Baby its cold out side
Let me hold you warmly
I don’t need this sweater
Maybe you can wear it for me
Im missing all those walks
That we had around town
Your presence is a present
With you, I could never frown
In your love in which I downed
With my heart upon my crown
You were the queen to my king
Let me show you around
This is where my heart goes
Remember? Cause you took it
Now you wanna give it back
Where was the problem girl?
Im lookin
You’re the queen up in my castle
Ill be out there crooken
Wanna spend a night together
Where you wanna go im lookin
Every road has a bump
We need to make it over
You’re the key to the ignition
You’re the movement to my motor
The highway of life
Speeding, baby we passing it
Ill tell you one thing
Theres no other I would travel with
2X- Chilling here in the atmosphere that’s where your love takes me
Push me away, got nothing to say, I want you back, you’re my baby

[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
BLACK MAMBA!
[Chorus: all]
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
Uh huh huh.. Black Mamba!
[RZA]
Yo unbreakable steel sword swingin', face the Black Mamba
Deadly Vipers, squeeze ya life out like anacondas
In the story, off wit ya head, the scene is gory
Single-edged steel blade made by Hattori
Hanzo, you see the signature of brother Han' though?
Try to strike out, you get ya arm dismantled
Chief of the Yakuza's wicked like Medusa
With Crazy 88's too, 'bout to meet ya maker
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Ol' Dirty Bastard swordplay
Dirt McGirt be pickin' up skirts on 4th and Broadway
Japanese bitch be suckin' my dick
Puerto Rican hoes be lickin' my split
California Mountain Snake on debate
Be givin' my head while I'm countin' my cake, crushin' up an 8th
Of that snow white shit, in the Pussy Wagon not hittin' the brakes!
[Chorus]
[Masta Killa]
Baaaaaamm.. hidden swordstyle hits, I wish
A nigga would test the Black Mamba, in a spit like the coma
Fill his Copperhead with the hollow tip lead
Yo.. who wanna dance with the fertile lands' deadly state?
Cottonmouth sticky from the Af' gooey
Blowin' smoke through the Viper Pit
Hold a listener tight, mic constrictor
Words from the theater, swift as Krishner
[Chorus]

[Kung Fu Sample]
We are watchin you open it
	Careful, careful, careful, careful
[Kardinal Offishall]
Eh yo, somethin in the Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Uh-huh, The T-Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Eh yo, somethin in the Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Word up, The T-Dot went (BOOP BOOP)
Let's go..
Yo, yo, eh yo, yo..
[Kardinal Offishall]
(FIRE) on the government, (FIRE) 'pon Babylon
(FIRE) 'pon the corrupted land on which we walkin on
Ice grills melt into a puddle in the struggle
Niggas try to bust back but get jooked by undercovers
You wonder why so many niggas out there sellin crack
Because police allow that, they add it to they paper stacks
Eh yo, people are you ready? (BOOP) Are you really ready? (BOOP)
Many need to know about the ghettos in the T-Dot
Oh, the news people try to pretty-up the scene
My peoples gettin killed out there, seen? (Seen)
None of y'all niggas can't talk about peace
When there's Palestine youths throwin rocks at police
In the streets we talk shit, a lot of young punks with guns
With dollars while the ghetto youths have no funds
The devils in this world always dress-up as nuns
Kardinal Offishall Firestarter Volume One
Careful..
[RZA]
Wait, hold up, chill, what's that son?
Damn nigga got fuck shit, huh?
The God stack, watch nigga run
Seven in the center of your eight point sun
Old type grip on the Guard U, Now you
Best be Careful, can't dodge two
Self-heats aimed at your dome piece
Father U C King police
[U-God]
Somethin in the slum went rum pu-pum-pum
Somethin in the slum went rum pu-pum-pum
[Masta Killa]
Yo Rae it's been a long time son
Since we bust gun, clap Glaciers
Ran the world and snatched paper
Return to the 36th Chamber
Proceed with caution as you Enter
We have an APB on an emcee Killa
Looks like the work of a Masta
[Cappadonna]
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Up in the force game, wildin money for grabs
I ain't fuckin with crabs, outta state
Cop two labs, hop two cabs, back on the Av
Stab you with the vocab, catch me at the big dopey head
Tryin to re-up, keep my feet up, snake niggas in the cut
Hold the pride up, your time is up
No love, heat start to bust, niggas you can't trust
Deal with lust, seen him at the ball games with James
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang
Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang
[Ghostface Killah]
Somethin in the hood went click, click
The box cutter went click, click
Somethin in the hood went click, click
The box cutter went click, click
These are the bones, bones from the grave
Yo, Hoodini, G-Dini, rhymes only, Noodles sprinkle throw yo Embry
Climb like the deficit, profits, death threats to Israel
Slid through Bethlehem, bong on one wheel
Syringes, rubber bands, needles, the sixties
Granddaddy Caddy, was coppin six g's
B'Gosh all that, Oshkosh jumpers
Pink Champele, brown paper bag, wall to wall pumpin
[U-God]
Beats in the camera guys, cause terror in ya eyes
Sweat on the hammer fly, Ways of the Samurai
News flash bulletin, Gods on the prowl
We full again, rough men, scuffed Timb's
Sonic bionic lens, RZA console
Is it Bush or is it Dole?, front row at the Super Bowl
Black gold in my soul, on the whole, stroll
Don't go boy, you on parole, you don't know?
[Inspectah Deck]
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money is stacked, now bust ya gun clack, clack
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money is stacked, now bust ya gun clack, clack
Made 'em throw they hands up and then lay flat
Rap pack, eat up, the average alley cat
Prepare for the impact, when we contact
Known to drop facts that crack your hard hat
Must I Show N Prove? Trust I, bust I
Make your head spin like chrome 20's on the Buggy Eye
Benz, who contends? Wu like the Super Friends
Who's Your Rhymin Hero? Wu-Tang rules again
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money to stack, now bust ya gun clack, clack
Someone in the back went clack, clack
Money to stack, now bust ya gun clack, clack

Somethin in the street went bang, bang
Makin it hard for you to do your thang, thang
Somethin in the street went bang, bang

Careful, Careful, Careful, Careful

[Verse 1:Guru]
Myself 
lord
 and master
Shall bring disaster to evil factors
Demonic chapters shall be captured by kings
Through the storms of days after
And to the earth from the sun
Through triple darkness to blast ya
With a force that can't be compared
To any fire power
For its mind power shared
The brainwave causes vessels to circulate
Like constellations reflect at night
Off the lake
Word to the father and mother earth
Seeking everlasting life through this hell
For what its worth
Look listen and observe
And watch another sea cycle
Pullin my peeps to the curb
Heed the words
Its like ghetto style proverbs
The righteous man sacrifice
To get what they deserve
Cannot afford to be confined to a cell
Brainwaves swell
Turning a desert to a well
Experience the best teacher
Thoughts will spring like streetsweepers
Little daddy street preacher
Illustrious feature
Narrator you select
Accompanied by Deck plus the DJ you respect
Seven and a half combined
Over the frontline
The ten percenters
Promotin slander in the air time
Bear in mind
Jewels be the tools of the trade
Sharp blades heavenly praise
And dues are paid
Above the crowds above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds raining down
Holdin it down
[Verse 2:Inspectah Deck]
I leave scientists mentally scarred
Triple extra large
Wild like rock stars
Who smash guitars
Poison bars from the gods
Bust holes in your mirage
And catch a charge
Shake em down like the riot squad
Invade your zone
Ruined like ancient Rome
I span the universe and
Return to earth to claim my throne
The maker owner
Plus sole controller
Ayatollah rest in the sky
The clouds my sofa
Stand like colossus
Regardless to whom or what
Numerous attempts at my life
So who to trust
Who but us
To supply ya with the fire
The burning truth
150 absolute proof
On the mic like Moses
Smokin golden la
Survivor of the oldest tribe
Whose soldiers die
I know the five families
Who shed tears and more
But our hands are on the ammo
Cause the battles still on
Sound the horn
We come rumblin through the function
Precise laser beam technique
To touch something
When we die hard
They build a monument to honor us with
Humongous effect in the world
We couldve conquered it
Above the crowds above the clouds
Where the sounds are original
Infinite skills create miracles
Warrior spiritual
Above the clouds raining down
Holdin it down

[Ghostface Killah talking]
Word up Wu-Tang
We gon' do this for y'all up in here real quick
Word up, that's my word know what I mean
Got my man Muggs in effect, right by my side know what I'm sayin'
That's my people right there
Word up, word up Big Prince yeah
Yeah dog bless that right there
[Cappadonna]
From the lost and found villages, the rap Jesus Christ
Pender, ponder record might nail inside my right
It's who eye the vessel, chosen the rap slogan
Walk about the throne, royal black to be voguin'
The outcome forever when words are put together
Duck deep inside ya mind like Ludonna did to treasure
The map of Staten Island X marks the park hill
Bone you with skill, Donna business before pleasure
Niggas out for Donna then they wig gotta be measured
For guillotine and routine ya heard and never seen
Bloody mass murder situation unclean
Blindfold the rhythm, duck tape around the microphone
Weights are gettin' pushed back, heads are gettin' flown
Screams and yells, niggas is thristy for acapells
I meditate, coordination sparkle like a jewel
When I show articulation
The format of rap status, man show articulation
Down before the street and I ain't got no invitation
To a Wu-Tang concert, Killa Bee cookout
All pages due when I take my rap book out
I'm representin' for all my Gambino niggas, uh-huh
[Raekwon the Chef]
Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo detinate that
Detinate that pussy Massengill rap, cleanse that
The kids knife snatch collars off
Wile ridin' off
Float boat, big boys, Oakland A's stashed away blades
Venilation left the sharks animes
Something sheist like seven butcher knives
Rollin' rover style twice
Finger itchy like lice
Hair fell out, something to conquer
Stomp ya like that cat Blanka
Toy Tonka truck, ten carat on ya monster
Bring Rocky like fu-shick, motorize (Ahhh)
[Ghostface Killah]
Yo check it, check it, check it
Yo, yo, yo, yo, hey yo
We swindle, make moves
Peep gentle out the window
Flamingo, Santo Domingo, Lex Lingo
Bruce Wayne thinkin' graveyard rocks are swingin'
Multi-million, rap pavillion stay G'ing
All night, Mary Jane ventures, Bud Light
Cold production rights, spoke to Christ
Use Woolite
Statue heads all up in my lab like mag
Empty bags, a line in the yard well fed
Dead weight yo
Cable the clamp around the neck
Sucrets, fast corvettes, techs I'm a vet
Sabotage, rap motor large, Mickey caught a charge
Credit card scam, when he cry rock the Wu scarf
Televise the shit on Fox
Big Ghost'll grab the shit unfasten ya box
You're allergic to the fungus on Earth
Killa Bee headquarters is worth
Kadafi body in this turf yo
Shame on all y'all brothers on some Baywatch
Soundin' like me, suckin' my ss
Pretty tone, nicknamed the great Tony Atlas
Don't wanna come at this
[* Laughter *]

[Cappadonna talking]
Cappadonna up in here maintainin'
Big Prince know what I'm sayin'
Ghostface Killah, Raekwon the Chef, Jon ya know
[Cappadonna]
It's like fifty Stapleton, Don fifty Park Hill
All of y'all other crab niggas better chill
What, Stapleton, Park Hill organization
Death threat, we cover square inches of the nation
Avoid confrontation by all means necessary
Gold chains and gold teeth is definitely mandatory
When you come through Tony Touch territory
The burial ground sounds become a whole different story
Acapell jobs are fat jobs
New Cappadonna have props for years
On the intercom, my outcome, no they couldn't get none
Cause I wreck mics for fun
Casually flowin' smack me if I'm not knowin'
Give em' a chance to understand what they hearin'
Lick shots ya better maintain ya military bearin'
Cause in 97 Illuminati carry Glocks
But I can't afford to forfeit cause I was born to rock they knots
Danger if you ever want more anger
Bring ya whole drive by family into my chamber
Don is more maculate, Rae is more maculate
Ghost is more maculate, Prince came to tackel it
Who holdin' me down, 96 representin' for 97
All night grove right here
[* Ghostface Killah begins talking, fades into Wu Tang Part 2]

[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yeah, now we're gonna give a shout out, knowumsayin'?
Def Jam, knowumsayin'?
Niggas like Method Man, Redman
Say all the artists here, knowumsayin'?
Bacon Lot, knowumsayin'?
I don't need no introductions, Cat
Whuuuuut
I'm sittin' in my west, I'm analyzin' thoughts
I'm sippin' off a quart that I just had bought
I'm thinkin' of the moment, things soar in that head
I feel assurin' durin', also glad
Yes, feel assured by knowin' I won
Cuz there's no one who can fuck wit A-Sun
I'm not bein' pushy but I'm born to boss
You need A-Sun, oh yes, well of course
Don't see the riot, everyone keeps quiet
If you don't believe nigga, get hyper and try it
Yes it is me, a total fresh MC
Yo, I'm born to be, MC history
Rhyming on time because that's the deal
You're only as fresh as your ass feel
Other MC's, you are bound to fall
Cuz your real world is not a world at all
1 - [Street]
Drunken Master, styles causin' street disaster
Blaze cut faster than a fairy slasher
Tai-chi, Kung Fu fighting, ODB hands quick as lightenin'
Techique too deadly
Iron fist blew the pawn, switch styles like lay long
Let's get it on, heavy chow broke, it's not 'bout
Shadow boxin', better punch, you need oxegen, try again
When you catch the second wind, I'll break you in
[Masta Killa]
Approach the mic slow, it's about to blow
One foot crow crane, anti-chain movement
Restore the ming, some take this thing for joke
Serious men deep in thought, misunderstood, held the fork
He's too defensive, too mean, you didn't, now it's a scene
These cats over here got Glock holdin' him down
These niggas scheming, I'm seeing everything
Ten steps ahead, on the wall smokin' my
Agent high told best friend of the wine
[Method Man]
Still drunk offa cheap wine
Holdin' front lines, niggas wanna front, fine
Fuck wit me and mine, rain on your sunshine
Swine nigga's come as hard as a pork rind
Can you dig it? Only five percent live it
While the rest of you fake niggas try to get it
Now fuck around
Repeat 1
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Down wit the All In Together Now Crew
The GZA, the RZA, me of course too
The thing I'm analyzing is strickly Hip Hop
That's what's made, well made is on my workshop
You was unable plus earn advance
Just to touch the untouchable kip hop dance
They're sayin' of the utmost, truly I'm the utmost
Have you ever caught the hip hop holy ghost
Man, I mean really, that shit is mad hype
Especially when you find yourself rhymin' over mics
I became a wrecker through my amplifier
Break it down base, treble through my dancer
That's one new dance, it's to my Black Magic music
It's not classic, arabic, or basic
It's strickly thickly, dirty and districkly
If not don't you pick me and forget me
Repeat 1

[Intro: Method Man]
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh

Oh, that's Meth Man, southpaw, I throw my left hand
To that hardcore shit that even make the Tec jam
Oh my goodness!
 
Trust me, ain't nuttin' like some hood shit
Gotta love my dogs but ain't nuttin' like a good bitch
Strictly, if I'm goin' down, she comin' wit me
Whole time screamin', "Oh my God!", ain't no mystery
[Hook: Method Man]
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
[Verse 2: RZA]
Try to Wu hate, duck, you could suck my

Boomerang darts, you can't duck my
No tellin' which Clan man you got struck by
Chains get tucked when he walk by

Arrows bein' fired from crossbow

You can't Etcha-sketch all my rhyme threat
Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat strep
Soaked in cess, dope, you eat the cold Tec's

[Hook]
[Verse 3: Inspectah Deck]
Yo, amist the gravel, play the words of the Big Apple
Broadcastin' live from the pits of the battle
Wigs split and rattled, get shook out ya saddle
You ever hear me losin', one of y'all fix the panel
Ask who? Wu, that's true, known piranhas
Who knows drama, fathers of your whole persona
The mad doctor, 
stay locked in the O-R
In too deep, beyond reach of the sonar
Still a vet, say my name next to hall of fame
Hurtin' third string players, first day in the game
It's on, son, the Killa Bee swarm come
Make the world shake with one continuous drum
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Raekwon & (Masta Killa)]
Wave ya gun, Killa (I got you)
Shoot this nigga in his face fast, mumblin' (I heard y'all forgot Wu)
Wear ya crown, black down (Watch the block too)
Blow at y'all niggas (Blowin' at the cops too)
Eh-yo, my wallets stay bulletproofs
, racin' in Coups, yea we the realest
Ultraviolet leathers on, pealin' this, love lookin' the illest
Gorilla things, monster background with a history
You're pumpin' crack, yap clowns, we all real in here
Strap a bomb on a family member, let y'all niggas know we here
Blasted, it's like cheeba when I splashed it
Real reefer heads'll know the meanin' of hittin' glass
I told y'alls, against y'all, Ginsengs, avenge Gods
Picture me stabbin' you in the yard for R's
Kid saw Staten, nine Bin Ladens
Valors on, colorful draws, lookin' all relaxed in
[Hook: Method Man]
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Correct me if I'm wrong but fake thugs never last long
Can't wait until ya fake ass gone
Y'all been warned, about them Killa Bees on the swarm
Y'all been warned, You either step or get stepped upon
Nigga, uh-oh! I think they're playin' our song
Lit blunts, clan in the front, sayin' "It's on!"

* samples were not cleared for the official album release
[Raekwon]
Y'know? General, general! Word out...
Yeah...
Aiyyo man.. you poppin fuckers
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[Intro: Wu-Tang Clan]
It's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block!
{*continuously scratched*} "From the gate now!"
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
Aiyyo, it's just rules with beats - you clown niggas can't rule the streets
We set shop! Wu-Tang, we rule the East
Taking over the block, you can't fuck with the block!
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[Raekwon]
Aiyyo, I stay funky and piley, blue Excelero
They lookin for me, what the fuck you behind me for?
Stressing everything I breathe on
I'm from the boulevard where niggas get jacked and peed on
Whatever homey, we more lavish
I might sneak you in the crib, see my lasers and glasses
Try to get my come up on
Yo, and when you see me, you know I got my "come up" arm on
Cartier called me up, robbery here
We got your seed in the back of the Beemer starving
We like lion killers, catch me on stage with the gauge
In my right hand, grenade and this leather bomber
I scout money, you know we hungry and talk funny
Coughing out corner rappers, don't never walk up on me
I write with only insane Malkovich
My troops gave me money to clown with them, fuck it
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[Masta Killa]
My first gun was a .32, back before uh!
Graduated to the .38, maybe a nine
I prefer the fo' five, stay alive
Techs held the crack gank in '88
8 oz. straight from Florida, the best temp
Camouflage vest, repping the set
Wu on the east wing, twenty-ten, sexy bad
We up at Spain with that thing thing, my crew strong
We take no search for your party dunn, you know how I run
Spray places, cover faces, beat cases
A big mouth will get your teeth knocked the fuck out
Keep a nunchuk, take money, stay ninja
I injure, any motherfuckin contender
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[Method Man]
Hey bitch, your time's up! Go finish them rhymes up
All my soldiers is lined up, my corners is crimed up
Niggas know where to find us, settin the grind up
Police checkin them pies up, my rims are shined up
Wu! We on the rise up, crops supplied up
Plottin niggas demise up, boxed in conduct
Scratch we got 'em sized up, and when the East is in the house
You, you, you, you, you...
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[Ghostface Killah]
On the side of the projects, grey skully, bubble 'Lo goose
Mac 11 tucked in front of the belly
Prestigious moves, we killin 'em, hoes we drillin 'em
We like George Foreman out in the streets, we grillin 'em
In the van, .45's and dilly's, ready to slam it
House arrest box is goin off, Tony got grams
Gotta bath tub full of white, lay in it like Sam Montana
Tune 'em out, to blow out, chop 'em like fans
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[Inspectah Deck]
This is boulevard hard, lounging in your black car
Camouflage rat guard on "Stomp the Yard"
I-N-S spit monster bars, flip long regards
My click dons bitch, y'all are frauds
I get it in like Tim off the glass
Slamming my name, I'm like the prez, sending men off to blast
What I spit, make 'em spend all their cash
I'm so Wu, so new that I ain't ripped off the tags
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[U-God]
RZA done birthed us, some curse on purpose
I'm the grouch, my mouth is a circus
Burner plus a good learner, don't need a hood
All I need's a good burner, nocturna
Snake rat murderer, all I hear is turf talk
Rack rooms full of goons with bullet wound birthmarks
From the first spark, you heard my response
(Wu-Tang!) More results talkin 'bout whole crew's mission just lost
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[RZA]
Out the beehive, you dip and you dive
But you still can't survive, you can't see past five
Check the outlook, this is not in the book
You bein dragged across the floor while your 'dro in my hook
Lyrical joust, found all the deal off the books
Steve Rif gave the nod to Universal, good look
Still spit poison venom, Red Monkey and Wu dem
Have any dudes seen the condos? It's all 'em
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)
[GZA]
Put my +clan in da front+, +reunite+ 'em
Make 'em all R.S.V.P., if they want it, we don't invite 'em
No beef, less talk and more action
We parole as a whole, we'll send you back in fractions
Break through fanatic, low crates deep in attics
The Abbott pulled out a .45, looped with static
I scrolled through the menu then rolled to the venue
The dress code is armor all, put a hole up in him
(You better watch your motherfuckin mouth)

[Method man]
Still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the...
I'm just tryna get a meal
When I started rhyming wasn't tryna get a deal I was tryna get a feel
Homocide housing bodies lying in the Hill
Man they nothing with me dying in the field
Especially when I'm tryna pay the bills
A lot of y'all be lying about the steel and see the court denying your appeal
If y'all don't know, nothing you better know its real
If it work like a workshop better know the drill
I'm past childish gaze, y'all just tryna take me outta my game
And calling my black women out of their name
I'm serious stay out of my brain
Understanding my slangs, Fast and Furious they out of my lane
Boy I'm hot, kids be Calling me blaze
In the industry Í'm not, they be Calling me slave
I ain't tryna burn the spot, but I'm setting my way
I'm just a Product of the block, and the city im raised
Im still living by the code
Too many pretty women still living by the strode daddy pimping them for dough
Early in the morning cops kicking in the door/do'
Man I Think somebody's snitching on the low
I caught my father sniffing on that snow
That's when he tried to tell me things are different than before
Kids dont listen any mo', thats fo' sho'
We used to ask permission from my fo'
Ain't no food up in the kitchen cause we broke
I ain't tryna miss Another, meal cause love it get you killed
And if it dont your baby mother will
But y'all ain't recognizing that is, real
Untill that undercover pulls his shield
And now it's kinda late to cut the deal
So I ain't gotta tell you how I feel
While im tryna get my pockets stuffed with hundred dollar bills
I should've went to school and get a skill
But it wasn't in my future so I steeled, thats why I got this Fruger in ya' grill
[U-God]
Cracking [?] is one of the best
Now, feel the force of the full Court press
I apply to kiss the death, something for real the realness
Untouchable, Alien nesc, you select of vet
Take me off the bench, I supose to lynch,¨
The angel in the air you can smell my stench
Soldiers in the trench, moving east to west
I gave you a note, you can keep the rest
RIP the whole coast when I heat the flesh
At the greek fest, hit a couple of bars
Smash rips on strips like bumber cars
You're amongst the odds, with lies in the pelly
The baby, nine, the size of a celly
Now it's a dilemma like Nelly and Kelly
Milk Pirelli Tower when I peel it in a hurry
The fist of fury martini with a cherry
Is very neccecary when I make it to the top
I'mma pop adi Very staten Island fairy where the legends were made
In the staircase throw a rap grenade
Take it back in the day, get clapped for your chain
"F" the blood bath it will be half of the pain
He is a high grand bullet women call him daddy
Fishtank shoes jump out the Caddy
Grand finali yo the champ is here
The cameras clear under the chandelier
While you standing there, like you can hold it down
Its nine of us all of us rock the crown
Tear it down down to the last compound
New York mixed with a Compton style
Roll bonkers wild, on the stomping ground
Lay down the carpet when I'm walking down the isle
Then Telephone [?] keep stalking the child
For misdemeaner now I'm going to triel
So included it exile like my sex while
Private jet style who's the livest vet now`
Pass me a wet towel dont get wedged now
I ring it your chest when I let the tech growl
[Masta Killa]
We used to rock um, leather gooses, with cheap skin coats and barmers
British Walkers, Sharp skinned [?]
Playboy black sways, Three finger rings name plate rope chains
DVD, nylon cazal frames, and Matching with the Kangol hat

See crack never kept me high longer than five minutes
While I be Clark ofcourse silked in linnen
Jumbos two for five come and get it
Mamma crys tears of fear when I was wilding son
Please dont wear that, people are getting killed for that
Latin quarter union Square you had to be there
The fever, MC glory, Ripping the armory
This is hip hop to me, and for all of y'all, this is wu tang clan
Signing off, you know how we do forever
[Method man]
Ay yo I gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
Lick my first  blunt off the day then start the movement
Im chilling in a room with a view, There's Always room for improvment
So I grab my coat and go and prove it
Its me against the world, you can find me in the streets
You dont spot me in the lobby probably find me in a freak
Cop ferraris, the law be in the lining up in my seats
Tryna put me in a line up 'till I wind up in a beast
That's the belly, how dare they tryna tell me when to eat?
With this plate of food barely in my reach
My team shoot dice, we used to shoot skelly in the streets
Wore the same pelli pelli for a week
But now we live the Life, its such a good Life
I wish that I could live it twice
I'll probably make the same wish my wife
Wu tang clan Always collect cheddar
Propper education Always correct better
[Method man]
Crime scene, choppers and sirence helicopters
High beam the tention is Rising
Fiends keeping they pipes Clean
This is what Lifes mean?
A dollar and a Dream everyobdy wants nice things
The kid was only 19, hole in his chest now, he's figthing
For his last breath to seeing death is frightening
The grip on the ghetto is thighting
You try to do the right thing, and they do you just like King
Now I can hear the night scream sirens and light beams
[?] bad shots, hitting people that they didn't mean to pop
The neighbourhoods in shock, block extremly hot
Another black teen shot is a normal routine for cops
They should've got good grades, work at minimum wage
Now they lying on the stretcher with nothing in them to save
Keep it ghetto, and whatever ghetto you at
Just dont love the ghetto, cause the ghetto dont love you back
[Masta killa]
Gotta be around this music it's therapeutic
First fresh thought to tell you so clear
When im Walking my head, Theres a voice that talks
In my ear, I can hear it so clear (you Think im bugging right)
[U-God]
The average man, wouldn't last that lang
She like to work out run Marathons
She wear, tight skirts with no panties on
She's a 6 foot 1 bronze amazon
Saying, complaining about all the good men gone
Im from bablong she reach the [?]
Holding jails in the nail salons
She rock Coco Chanel her smell was strong
With skin like velvet, she robbed my bank
She gave, no [?] Sipping long [?]

She rubbed on her legs this is what I said
Rap music is therapeutic to me

Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight [x3]
Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight [overlaps INS talking]
[Inspectah Deck:]
Another mission, Street Life, gun talk, Sir I
Don't push me, because I'm close to the edge
Livin on this thin line, I know the ledge
Allegience I pledge strictly to my comittee
Way above the law, we soar the inner city
My crime pays, deep in the metro, nines blaze
Shorties watchin plus adoptin my ways
In the PJ's, the heat blaze and beats raid
Can't see the cage but can't leave the Streets Of Rage
[Street Life:]
It's a Shoot On Sight fair, warfare prepared
Arm yourself beware, hardware tear through your flesh and bones bear
Witness stand clear
Flash the Wu-sign to see if my comrades is in here
PLO began this, ninety-nine bananas
Wu extravaganza, cops scandals and guns, a S.O.S
Prepare for the slug fest, unusual suspect disconnet your outfit
It's a dead-end Street, I play for keeps release, shots through your fleece
Retreat, delete you from the crime spree
[Chorus:]
Shoot em On Sight Sight Sight [x2] [overlaps entire Chorus]
When you got beef wit one time-S.O.S
When you standin on the front line-S.O.S
Niggas wanna steal your sunshine-S.O.S
When it comes time to do or die-S.O.S
For the five-oh that brutalize-S.O.S
Before you try suicide-S.O.S
[Street Life:]
Street chronicle, wise words by the abominal
High honorable, rap quotable phenomenal
Seniority kid, I speak for the minority
Ghetto poverty fuck the housing authority
Not to be idolized, I deal wit grand larceny
Money laundaring, auto theft, and armed robbery
Ninety-nine regimine torment your resident
Street intelligence child, KillaHill pedestrian
Sucker for love-ass, niggas catch a gay-bash
Slim-Fast from the gun blast burner, I last
The S-T-R, double E-T, own a Desert E
Keep it closely, I feed off envy and foul energy
Your best friend's your worst enemy
Thug therapy until they bury me, it's do or die tonight
Shoot out a street light, bleak life
Aim at your windpipe, squeeze tight
[Inspectah Deck:]
In the parking lot, parked in a dark spot
The specialist wit one shot been at the drop
Your Highness INS, darts catch your body
Feds got me on watch wit nuttin yet to charge me
I strike quick, movin on the night shift
Rollin wit those who been the same likeness
Where I come from the blast make your ears go numb
Trust no one cuz murderers range old to young
And death don't discriminate, to choose your fate
Shot wit hypedermic sword wit the trey-eight
Gotta hold your weight, there's no escape from the mayhem
I'm livin for now but tryin to make it to the a.m
Creepin in the hallways, we always on barrow
Calico crept close to over cash flow
The neighborhood watch, the skunks in my sock got me rocked
But keep my eyes on the shot clock
[Chorus]

[Intro: Prodical]
Yo son I know what time it is
Yo tell em, 12, huh? (Yo hold the fuck up)
Yo Shyheim
Yo tell me it's on (I'm a punch niggas in the face)
Hold that, hold that down son (I got this, I got this)
Word up, we got this (Fuck that nigga, man)
"Shit Is Real", all you rats on both coasts
Brooklyn, Shaolin
The block is hot, straight up (Pussy nigga!)
(Read the rims)
[Prodical:]
'87, drug, never change their game
We regin terror, projects slang to ring up in the Beakle's leather
Plaque for the cheddar, shots out the face of the Beretta
Through the corner store that lady and kid, they caught it raw
Smokin' leaf poor, make me wanna crack that nigga's jaw
Eatin' with the poor, tryin' to live life for what it's for
Twelve years later, caught me on tour Two on Da Road
Two on the track, two with the plaques, two with the gats
Iced out cats, better think twice before you rap
Up in your bitch back, only a snitch get that
Fuck the chit-chat, click-click-clack, through your Adam's app'
Brook-nam grace and charm, remain calm
In these big streets we struggle just to make ends meet
Pigs with heat, livin' out the Devil's deceit
See I'm a rebel plus my level's complete
Bitches say I'm sort of unique
You can catch me as a Playboy sheets
Solid steel meet, I keep it real with the 'nique
[Shyheim:]
Fuck a fair fight, come out my corner with a knife
Y'all big elephant niggas beware of us little mice
You know that we like that cheddar, to make our life better
Every colour, low sweater, drop-top Benz
With the AMG letters, floatin' like feathers
Does it get any better? (Uh-uh, uh-uh) Never, no
Cause I write the rhymes, the rhymes I write be bumpin'
Rhyme architects that be brutal on production
My brick house, you can't blow me down
My thug drug music, smoked out ya town
Radio Shyheim, you can't choke me out
Cause where the fuck I'm from, we moke popo out
[Chorus: 12 O'Clock]
Shit is crazy real in the field
Watch nigga blood get spilled over $5 bills, nigga
And major drug deals on the real
Watch a nigga get mils, and his bitch get him killed
[12 O'Clock:]
Yo, P let's get this dough quick, shit on the wrist
Platinum bracelets, see his Range's the whip
Summer time, comin' quick you got eighty-five percent
Nigga talk that slick and get his brain blown to bits
Throw you in pits and nigga lock like pits
Got my whole fuckin click, nigga, handlin' fifths
They blastin' and shit, I'm after that kid
Who rock that glass Benz, nigga throw it in his wig
Kidnap his kid, throw his brain in the fridge
Slappy and pig, nigga, place where I live
A nigga lookin' jig and I run up in ya crib
Who the fuck murdered BIG? whoever did, do a bid
And let his daughter drop a fridge on his
Move like the wind to Brooklyn Bridge, straight to my crib
[Chorus x3]
[Outro: 12 O'Clock]
Close the mothafuckin' door, what?
Got my nigga R'son on this track
12 O'Clock on this track
Prodigal Sunn on this track
Got my nigga Shyheim the ManChild
Definitely Brooklyn Zu
Rewind that shit, nigga

[Ol' Dirty Bastard *singin*]	[RZA]
Reunited cuz it feels so good   Yo, yo, niggas ain't shit
Reunited cuz we're understood   Your bitch ain't shit
There's one perfect thing and   Your momma ain't shit
Children this one is it         Your daddy ain't shit
We both we're so excited cuz    You ain't shit
We're reunited, hey! hey!       Niggas ain't shit
Your momma ain't shit
Your daddy ain't shit
You ain't shit, you ain't shit
Yo, yo
[GZA]
Reunited, double LP, world excited
Struck a mass to the underground, industry ignited
From metaphorical parables to fertilize the Earth
Wicked niggas come, try to burglarize the turf
Scattin off soft-ass beats, them niggas rap happily
Tragically, that style, de-ter-iate, rapidly
Uncompleted missions, throwin your best known compositions
You couldn't add it up, if you mastered addition
Where I come from, gettin visual is habitual
De-mon-strate walkin on hot coal, in rituals
I splash the paint on the wall, it formed the mural
He took a look, saw the manifestation of it, was plural
Rhymin while impaired, dart hit your garment
Pierced your internals, streamlined compartments
Just consider the unparallel advantage
Of a natural disaster that's impossible to manage
[Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm known on the microphone as the rap professor
Casual dresser, you may dress fresher
The way that I speak this shit is energetic
My physique of meat is quick atheletic
Remove all MC's who disapprove
That my funky fresh particle always have the groove
You're jealous over me because you're not a competitor
You're just a donor, I'm the rap editor
Tryin to rock the mic when you get an appetite
All negative on the mic, I dislike
Try to rock the mic but only will reduce
Try to get loose, you juice as a youth
Not knowin to yourself that you shall be frozen
I'm the MC warrior, who has been chosen
To rock and shock beats, polite when I recite
Sulfur MC's, you are down right, out right
Try to be talkative, there's no alternative
Hide until I forgive, this motive
I am unique with the perfected physique
The objective of my rhyme is my own technique
I maintain the paradise on this Earth
With the shut the fuck up style for what this shit is worth
Watch a nigga catch a purse
Super-hero niggas die
Do my dirt, get away and multiply
You bitches, ya nice guys
Always want bitch, because ya need mine
I pleased on how I get up on the stage and fuck up the show
Cuz nobody can't fuck with me!
You bootleggin buyin motherfuckers, don't do that with me
With all these child-support cases I got, I needs my money!
Earl for ages, a 100 and down, sacrifice ya baby to the underground
The best kept secret, how does it feel to be boxin in
Like a skeleton, growin back ya skin?
When I was young, I was taught how to produce
The science of babies gettin loose
I turned white boys to Springsteen spruce
Black to spooks, gave the Chinese Bruce
I can't help it if my style is foggy, monster boogie
Get ya high on my patio, all come to see me movie
Bicthes, you're walkin on my dirt
We ain't sayin nuthin
I whisper in ya ear, make ya blink cold Pert
Love potion, plenty bones I put up
What!? What!? What!? What!?
You know what time it is
Mothefuckers!
[Ol' Dirty Bastard *singing*]    [Ms. Roxy]
Reunited and it feels so good    It's Wu mothefuckers
Reunited cuz we're understood    ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
There's one perfect thing
And children this one is it
We both we're so excited
Cuz we're reunited, hey! hey!    It's Wu motherfuckers
Ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
It's Wu motherfuckers
Ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
				 It's Wu motherfuckers
Ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers
[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I want to give a big shout out to the Wu-Tang Clan
We holdin it down. YouknowI'msayin?
I also want to show mad love to Puffy cuz you holdin it down
Master P, you holdin it down
KnowI'msayin? Dr.Dre, you holdin it down
Give Snoop my love, E-40
MC Eiht, West Coast, word is bond
This is family, I don't give a fuck!
Striaght up. It's Dirt Dog, nigga!
Y'all niggas know how the fuck I get down!
KnowI'msayin? I'm here to represent this shit!
KnowImean? I love y'all niggas!
Motherfucker, my stomach hurts!
Bitch, I got to go!
(ah, Wu-Tang motherfuckers...)

[Intro: RZA]
Me.. me
[Hook 4X: RZA]
(It's all about who?) It's all about me
[RZA]
Booga booga bang! Yo Enter the Wu-Tang Clan
Get a god damn, yes I am the man
And I'm gonna blow, make mad dough
Girls sweat me cuz I've got the flow
Not the one to front when it comes to a stunt
I be quotin books like brothers smoke blunts
And do what you got to do, hold your own
Don't try to pass me just Pass the Bone
I get slam just as the hit rams
See? A girl flipped hands cuz she wanted to jam
I told her, "Yo be on your very way
I'm not gonna be your's, I won't beg you to stay"
Hey, what's the hardest thing about it? Like De La Soul
Between me, myself and I, it's a small world
I have to figure out, what is life about
It's all about me!
[Hook 4X]
[RZA]
Here I come, here I come with the Wu-Tang drum
It ain't no fun if I don't get none
So I got mines, you better get your's
When it comes to Kim's, you better get your's
Ooh, kind of frisky, could this be it? Risky
I pull stings on you, like girls hit me
The incredible, talk unforgettable
Talk what I do, chew when I walk
On Pillsbury dough, I'm hittin like a ho
Forty-five, then I strike like lightnin bolts
In the sky, right for your eye
I chop off the head of the guy that despise
First to merk me meets the controversy
Who'll be the first MC to try and curse me?
Watch watch watch watch me knock him out
And tell him what it's about, it's all about me
[Hook 4X]
[RZA]
Master of the Wu-Tang, here I am again
About to ill again, kill 'em with my pen
Check 'em check 'em, watch me as I wreck 'em
Brothers jump up like a straw as I disect 'em
I was all wild when I fouled your whole style
The crowd gets wild in the Isle, then I bow
Gotta have it, see a mic, I grab it
Here's a fat ass, fast I gotta stab it
Hanky panky, the rap suckers thank me
So many brides, I end up with a blank G
See? I'm not the one to be played
Got a gun now I'm not afraid
Quick to put a savage in the grave
The behavior possessed by the nature
Population causes me to be a slayer
So I walk around takin devils out
And show 'em what it's about, me
[Hook to fade w/ variations]
