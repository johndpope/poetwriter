Yes
, I am growing old 
&
 weak
But 
so, my friend, are you
Each day I move closer to death
And you move closer too
Come meet me at the waterfall
Come join me in the mist
I'll 
clutch ur lapels
 & 
mad dog u
As we 
plunge
 into the abyss

Johanna drove slowly into the city
The Hudson River all filled with snow
She spied the ring on His Honor's finger
Oh-oh-oh
A thousand years in one piece of silver
She took it from his lily-white hand
Showed no fear--she'd seen the thing
In the young men's wing at Sloan-Kettering
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey!
His Honor drove southward seeking exotica
Down to the pueblo huts of New Mexico
Cut his teeth on turquoise harmonicas
Oh-oh-oh
I saw Johanna down in the subway
She took an apartment in
 
Washington Heights
Half of the ring lies here with me
But the other half's at the bottom of the sea
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
Look outside at the raincoats coming, say "oh"
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!
'Ey, 'ey, 'ey, 'ey!

I saw you down at the station
Your leather suitcase bursts at the seams
Stay all day up in your rooms now
That's not a problem you've ever seen
Fall on your knees
 
wasting your arrows
You thought you walked along these halls
I awoke up in the bedroom
You'd gone out hunting
I was asleep
Spend my day out at the fountain
That's not a problem you had foreseen
Fall on your knees wasting your arrows
You've thought you walked along these halls
Fall on your knees wasting your arrows
You found you've walked along these halls
Oh it's no use at all
But that life in the church could still remain

So what if I'm selfish
You know I can't help it
Some things just clash like 
Jews and shellfish
The factory built this
For girls feeling helpless
MCs with rayguns
Still couldn't help this
Props for Sheila
Though she couldn't feel a
Beat for a minute, a song for a second
I pay less for cheaper
Blow out your speaker
Didn't I tell you that my style cuts deeper?
Cuz if the only flow you've got is menstrual
Then go back to your room and practice rhyming
Til you know those instrumentals
Cuz I make the beats
Like the bees make the honey
I'll sample The Beatles if I want to spend money
Cuz I don't buy Gucci, I don't buy Prada
You look like a ho from a ranch in Nevada
And if you wanna fight
You know I gotta lot of shit to say
So you best step off it
Bitches so extraordinary
Don't you know it blows my mind?
I've been here since January
And you still look just as fine
So there we was
Me and bitches
Making like fishes in the stream of life
Minimize the strife
Minimize the stress
Focus on the breasts
Focus on the thighs
Bitches asking
Why this, why that, how come
L'Homme Run
Where'd they come from?
I'm so dumbstruck
I'm so tongue tied
Call it dumb luck
Call it half-fried, half-baked, half way
Still tried, still true, still great
Still you want more encore, encore!
On stage, next page, on tour, next page
On your doorstep
Asking for forgiveness
Please Miss Bitches
I'm so sorry
I was stupid
I thought you would understand me
Understand we had big plans
But can we start all over?
Bitches so extraordinary
Don't you know it blows my mind?
I've been here since January
And you still look just as fine
I don't need no adversary
So just step right back in line
Mr. Green is honorary
And it never will be mine
Bitches so extraordinary
Don't you know it blows my mind?
I've been here since January
And you still look just as fine
I don't need no adversary
So just step righ
t back in line
This degree is honorary
And it never will be mine

Chestnut Park on a Saturday night
Mystical boys feelin' alright
Raggedy wisdom falls from my hand
The ladies of Cambridge
 
know who I am
I've held dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it
Take it
Take it
Graveyard freaks, we're fallin' in style
Lady's the pharaoh, Charles's the Nile
That's a museum, that's a cool place
Stones of your fathers standin' today
I've held dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it
Take it
Take it
I've held dreams of Boston all of my life
Chinatown between the sound of the night
Cause when you left my room
To go to the kitchen
I imagined that you were dead
A morbid streak runs through
The whole of my family
But for you I could put it to rest
But if you leave I just don't think I could take it
Take it
Take it
Take it

[Verse 1]
Ion displacement won't work in the basement
Especially when I'm not with you
Here in the heartland
A feeling so startling
I don't know what I should do
[Hook]
Oh Bryn
, you see through the dark
Right past the fireflies that sleep in my heart
You know it's easy to see
Wait for the season to come back to me
[Verse 2]
Nights by the ocean
A westerly motion
That moves California to sea
Eyes like a seagull
No Kansas born beetle
Could ever come close to that free
[Hook]

Wouldn’t ever 
gag you with a spoon
, my only true love
Never really heard you speak that way, 
it’s unworthy of…
Funny how that little college girl called language corrupt
Funny how the other private schools had no Hapa Club
Someone took a trip before you came to ski in the Alps
Your father moved across the country
Just to sunburn his scalp
Contra Costa
, 
Contra Mundum
, 
contradict what I say
Living like the French Connection, but we’ll die in LA
[Hook]
Blasted from a disconnected light switch
Through the condo that they’ll never finish
Bounced across a Saudi satellite dish
And through your brain to California English
No one sits inside a freezing flat and stays there ‘til May
Leafing through 
a stack of A-Zs
 to surf the UK
Waiting with 
the wind against your face
And gel in your hair
Shivering in little undershirts, but don’t seem to care
[Hook]
Sweet carob rice cake
She don’t care how the sweets taste
Fake Philly cheese steak
But she use real toothpaste
Cause if 
that Tom’s
 don’t work
If it just makes you worse
Would you lose all of you faith in 
the good Earth
And if it’s all a curse
And we’re just getting worse
Baby, please don’t lose your faith in the good earth

Oh california oh california oh california oh
Oh california oh california oh california oh
This girl wrote drug raps in baggy sweaters
Tight neon tights, t-shirts and big letters
Back at her house
Was an Irish setter
With a heart shaped tag
Hanging off its collar
Through half the towns of arizona
I dream the dreams I have when I hold her
Near palm springs we were struck by boulders
Cause they look like 
skull in bones
Oh california oh california oh california oh
Oh california oh california oh california oh
Questions I had
As I went through this
Are our parents actually buddhist?
Is the pool below me the bluest?
Is the tv on?
Through half the 
taquerias y fondas
Half the health clubs
, half of the saunas
Half the Barbaras, half of the Rhondas
Is there something there?
Oh california oh california oh california oh
Oh california oh california oh california oh
Oh california oh california oh california oh
Oh california oh california oh california oh
This girl was smarter than television scripts
This girl wasn't damaged her jeans were just ripped
"this girl was the girl that the girls in your world thought about"
When the night was cold
How many times they've claimed that they know you
How many nations think that they own you
How many simple minds think the same sun don’t shine on their sunglasses now
Oh california oh california oh california oh
Oh california oh california oh california oh
Oh california oh california oh california oh

I wake up
My shoulder's cold
I've got to leave here
Before I go
I pull my shirt on
Walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor
I pull my shirt on
Walk out the door
Drag my feet along the floor
Then I see you
You're walking cross the campus
Cruel professor
Studying romances
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
Walk to class
In front of ya
Spilled kefir
On your keffiyah
You look inside
And turn to the door
Drag your feet across the floor
Then I see you
You're walking cross the campus
Cruel professor
Studying romances
How am I supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
How am I
Supposed to pretend
I never want to see you again?
In the afternoon
You're out on the stone and grass
And I'm sleeping on the balcony
After class

As a young girl, Louis Vuitton
With your mother, on the sandy lawn
As a sophomore, with reggaeton
And the linens you're sittin' on
Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want to fuck?
Like you know I do
Like you know I do
This feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
Can you stay up to see the dawn?
In the colors of Benetton
Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want ta?
Like you know I do
Like you know I do
It feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel too
Feels so unnatural, Peter Gabriel
Is your bed made?
Is your sweater on?
Do you want ta?
Like you know I do
Like you know I do

Quando sono solo
Sogno all'orizzonte
E mancan le parole
Sì, lo so che non c'è luce
In una stanza quando manca il sole
Se non ci sei tu con me, con me
Su le finestre
Mostra a tutti il mio cuore
Che hai acceso
Chiudi dentro me
La luce che
Hai incontrato per strada
[Chorus]
Con te partirò
Paesi che non ho mai
Veduto e vissuto con te
Adesso sì li vivrò
Con te partirò
Su navi per mari
Che, io lo so
No, no, non esistono più
Con te io li vivrò
Quando sei lontana
Sogno all'orizzonte
E mancan le parole
E io sì lo so
Che sei con me, con me
Tu mia luna tu sei qui con me
Mio sole tu sei qui con me
Con me, con me, con me
[Chorus]
Con te io li rivivrò
Con te partirò
Io con te

You found a sweater on the ocean floor
They're gonna find it if you didn't close the door
You and this smart one sit outside the side
In a house on a street they wouldn't park on the night
Dad was a risk taker
His was a shoe maker
You greatest hits 2006
Little list-maker
Heard codes in the melodies
You heeded the call
You were born with ten fingers and you're gonna use them all
Interesting colors
I discovered myself
If your art life is gritty you'll be toasting my health
If an interest in culture should be lining the walls
When your birth right is interest you could just accrue it all
Me and my cousins
And
You and your cousins
It's a line that is always running
Me and my cousins
And
You and your cousins
I can feel it coming
You can turn your back on the bitter world
You can turn your back on the bitter world
You can turn your back on the bitter world
You can turn your back on the bitter world
Me and my cousins
And
You and your cousins
It's a line that is always running
Me and my cousins
And
You and your cousins
I can feel it coming

It's not right, but it's now or never
And if I wait could I ever forgive myself?
On a night when the moon glows yellow in the riptide
With the light from the TVs buzzing in the house
Cause I'm gonna cut it where I can
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance it's now then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you
He was a diplomat's son
It was '81
Dressed in white
 with 
my car keys hidden in the kitchen
I could sleep wherever I lay my head
And the sight of your two shoes sitting in the bathtub
Let me know that I shouldn't give up just yet
Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon
And then I'm gonna duck out behind them
If I ever had a chance it's now, then
But I never had the feeling I could offer that to you
To offer it to you would be cruel
When all I want to do is use, use you
He was a diplomat's son
It was '81
I know, you'll say
I'm not doing it right
But this is how I want it
I can't go back
To how I felt before
There's--
That night I smoked a joint
With my best friend
We found ourselves in bed
When I woke up he was gone
He was the diplomat's son
It was '81
Looking out at the ice cold water all around me
I can't feel any traces of that other place
In the dark when the wind comes racing off the river
There's a car all black with diplomatic plates

[Verse 1]
One look sent knees to the ground
Young bloods can't be settling down
Young hearts need the pressure to pound
,
So hold me close my baby
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't lie, I want him to know
Gods' loves die young,
 
is he ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold
[Chorus]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a lifetime right in front of you
And everyone I know
[Verse 2]
Young turks
, young Saturday nights
Young hips shouldn't break on the ice
Old flames,
 
they can't warm you tonight
So keep it cool, my baby
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Don't lie, I want him to know
Dial up, three rings and return him his gold
It's the last time running through snow
Where the vaults are full and the fire is bold
[Chorus 2]
I want to know, does it bother you?
The low click of a ticking clock
There's a headstone right in front of you
And everyone I know
[Pre-Chorus 3]
Don't lie, I'm want 'em to know
God's love die young
, are you ready to go?
It's the last time running through snow
Cause the fire can't last and the winter's cold
[Chorus]

I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, leave me to myself
I took your counsel and came to ruin
Leave me to myself, lead me to myself
Oh I was made to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Oh I was born to live without you
But I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath a chandelier
That’s going down
I thought it over, and drew the curtain
Lead me to my cell, lead me to my cell
I hummed the 
Dies Irae
 
as you played the Hallelujah
Lead me to my cell, don't leave me in my cell
If you’d been made to serve a master
You be frightened by the open hand, frightened by the hand
Could I have been made to serve a master
When I’m never gonna understand, never understand
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms
Looked up full of fear, 
trapped beneath the chandelier
That’s going down
Hold me in your everlasting arms

The title of Drake’s third album is Nothing Was the Same. Surely, this is one of the most aptly named albums of the year because on this outing Drake 
shows us an entirely different side of himself.
 The album cover (worth the price of admission alone!) lets the listener know that…
I gotta be honest — I didn’t listen to the whole thing. Obviously, it’s good. You think a Canadian child actor would be this successful as a rapper if he wasn’t good? The dude was sitting on 25 mil at age 25! (I would love to see some documentation on that, by the way. I’m not saying he didn’t have 25 mil, I’m just saying some of that was probably real estate and maybe like potential earnings from complicated endorsement deals.) 
People love him because he’s good! He gets 10 outta 10, OK?
I have heard SOME of it. I heard that one called “Worst Behaviour,” the “motherfuckers never loved us” one – it really struck a chord. There are SO many motherfuckers out there. I’ve been making music since I was seven years old (started with piano) so I’ve been betrayed more times than I can count. You know how many people talk shit behind your back and then try to be your best friend over the course of 22 years in the industry?? Drake only got into music like five years ago, so if you see how angry he is — IMAGINE HOW I FEEL
Now, usually I can forgive but I won’t forget. However, there are some cases where I can forgive but I won’t forget OR forgive
I remember in early 2007 we were opening for this Danish band in Portland. We introduced ourselves after soundcheck. Later in the evening, one of their amps stopped working and their tour manager asked if they could borrow mine. I said ABSOLUTELY, NO PROBLEM
After the show, I told the singer, Hans, that they sounded great. He said he really liked our set too. Then we talked about how we both LOVED this one Animal Collective song. He said his band was playing in New York in a few months and he would DEFINITELY hit me up when they got into town
Months later, I’m at home in NYC reading some blogs on my iPad. (Haha nope, it was a Dell desktop computer. Remember this was 2007… motherfucker. GOTCHA.) Oh, look at this — my Danish “friends” are playing tomorrow. Nice! I like those guys
Next morning, I check my phone. Lots of texts and e-mails from various friends and business associates A$ U$UAL but, curiously, no word from Hans. Later that afternoon, I check my e-mail again. NOT A WORD. I check Facebook. NOT A POKE. I check fucking MYSPACE. NOT A GODDAMN NEW MESSAGE. (I should point out that Hans’ band was in our Top 8 at the time.)
I’m starting to get tight so I call Iggy Azalea.
 (Oh, Iggy Azalea wasn’t around in 2007? Hmm so I guess she was born in 2008? She’s FIVE YEARS OLD? GO FUCK YOURSELF... motherfucker.) She helps me to cool off. She reminds me that touring is tough and Hans is probably overwhelmed. Maybe I should reach out to him
OK, I’LL SEND HIM A TEXT
“Hans, what’s up dude? I see you’re in New York. Have time for a drink? Also I’d love to come to the show. I see it’s sold out.”
I send the text and feel relieved but after 20 minutes, I start feeling fucking weird again. WHY HASN’T HE RESPONDED?
Maybe his Danish phone doesn’t work so well in America? YEAH, TOTALLY. That’s probably it
OK, I’ll just hit up my friend who works at the Bowery Ballroom to get on the list. NICE. A PLUS ONE? DON’T MIND IF I DO
I invite Panda Bear to roll with me. He says “SURE. THANKS FOR INVITING ME. DON’t MIND IF I DO.”
OK, the night’s starting to look pretty good. I start picking out an outfit to wear. My wife helps me look through my closet because I am colorblind
Why did I invite Panda Bear and not my wife? Fair question. Our son was only two months old at the time, so she didn’t want to leave him with a babysitter. Also, all u eagle-eyed readers might remember that Hans and I bonded over a shared predilection for a certain song by a certain band — that’s right, motherfuckers, the one and only ANIMAL COLLECTIVE
So I’m picking out my outfit when I hear a buzzing sound — OMG I’M GETTING A TEXT. I run upstairs PRAYING it’s from Hans but… it’s just Panda Bear again. His friend from college, Nathan, is in town. Can I get an extra plus on the list?
FINE. I make it happen
FLASH FORWARD ABOUT TWO HOURS:
Me, Panda and Nathan are walking to the show after 
getting some BBQ in the East Village (NOT MY IDEA)
. Panda and Nathan won’t stop talking about guys from their college frat. I smile and pretend to follow their rando stories. They keep saying “Oh, this is probably so boring for you. You don’t know anyone from our college.” BUT THEN THEY JUST KEEP ON REMINISCING
Also, the FIRST thing Nathan said to me was “Where’s the nearest ATM?” Fucking weirdo
We get to the Bowery Ballroom right as they’re playing their first song. I gotta be honest: they slayed. Hans’ voice sounded really pure. His pitch was great. Also, the bassist had a grunge-y flannel shirt wrapped around his waist. I remember thinking “Good call, dude!” This was 2007, motherfucker
The band played their encore, the crowd went mental and we headed backstage to say hi. The security guy stopped us and said our passes didn’t give us AAA. OK, LEMME JUST SHOOT HANS A QUICK TEXT
“AMAZING show man!! I’m downstairs with Panda and his random-ass friend from college. Can we come say hi? Wanna get a drink?”
As I’m waiting for a reply from Hans, Panda says he wants to go say hi to Daniel Bearman from Grizzly Bear at the bar. I didn’t really know Daniel at the time so I stayed put
OK, now it’s just me and NATHAN standing there like FUCKING LOSERS
I ask him if he liked the show. He says it was cool and then starts telling me this completely unrelated story about how his cousin plays cello and takes beta-blockers before big auditions
YIKES, just hit my word count limit. Thanks for listening. FUCK HANS. Panda, you’re cool. Nathan, I’m sorry I didn’t give you more of a chance. You died WAY too young. To my ex-wife, I will never stop loving you. My failure to save our marriage haunts me to this day. I hope you and our son are enjoying life in Atlanta

Bend my finger back (snap)
Wrap it in a paper towel
Break a twig in half and set it straight
Hit me with a wood bat
Hit me with a canister that's fired while
The soldiers drive away
Bend my finger back (snap)
On and on and on and on
 for days
Hit me with a wood bat
Hit me like a Yankee, like a son of
Freedom, never as a slave
It's etiquette, you idiot
Spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby you are mine
And baby you're not anybody's fool
Bless me with a heart attack
A real crise cardiaque
And show me where to find the
Surgeon’s knife
Eviscerate me now (hack)
Take me to my punishment?
The punishment I needed all my life
Bend my finger back (snap)
On and on and on and on with strife
Listen to my 
bum rap
Listen to 
the evidence exonerating me from
Being right
It's etiquette, you idiot
Spend time behind the line
Show sympathy to LA where the sun don't
Ever shine
Everybody wants you, but baby you are mine
Baby you're not anybody's fool
You know that I’ve been wicked and the
Road to hell is wide
Cursed by curiosity that made
Us go inside
Everyone was charming but we took 'em for a ride
Baby, you’re not anybody’s fool
[Repeat first verse]
The harpsichord is broken and the
Television's fried
The city's getting hotter like a
Country in decline
Everyone's a coward when you look
Them in the eyes
But baby, you're not anybody's fool
[Batshit Ezra Koenig spoken word interlude]
Sing next year in Jerusalem
You know -- the one at W. 103rd and B'way?
Cause 
this Orthodox girl fell in love with the guy at the falafel shop
And why not?
Should she have averted her eyes and just stared at the laminated poster of the Dome of the Rock?
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, bloooood
And then blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, blood, bloooood
Remembrances of holy days in 
Tarrytown and Rye
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
Condolences to gentle hearts who
Couldn’t bear to try
I don’t wanna live like this, but I don’t wanna die
Remembrances of holy days in Tarrytown and Rye
I don’t wanna live like 
this
, but I don’t wanna die

Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun
When I was 17, I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete
And now my body fades behind a brass charade
And I'm obsolete
But if the chance remained to see those better days
I'd cut the cannons down
My ears are blown to bits from all the rifle hits
But still, I crave that sound
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun
I heard you play guitar down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight
Your Tokugawa smile and your 
garbage style
Used to save the night
But like a nazi scheme or else an andriods dream
You faded like a mist
And in the years that passed since I saw you last
You found the vampires kiss
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun
Heyyy

[Chorus]
Your sword's grown old and rusty
Burnt beneath the rising sun
It's locked up like a trophy
Forgetting all the things it's done
And though it's been a long time
You're right back where you started from
I see it in your eyes
That now you're giving up the gun
[Verse 1]
When I was 17
I had wrists like steel
And I felt complete
And now my body fades
Behind a brass charade
And I'm obsolete
But if the chance remained
To see those better days
I'd cut the cannons down
My ears are blown to bits
From all the rifle hits
But I still crave that sound
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I heard you play guitar
Down at a seedy bar
Where skinheads used to fight
Your Tokugawa smile
And your 
garbage style
Used to save the night
You felt the coming wave
Told me we'd all be brave
You said you wouldn't flinch
But in the years that passed
Since I saw you last
You haven't moved an inch
[Chorus]
[Outro]
I see you shine in your way
Go on, go on, go on
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
A gardener told me some plants move
But I could not believe it
Till 
me and Hannah Hunt
Saw crawling vines and weeping willows
As we made our way from 
Providence to Phoenix
[Verse 2]
A man of faith said
Hidden eyes could see what I was thinking
I just smiled and told him
That was only true of Hannah
And we glided on through 
Waverley and Lincoln
[Chorus]
Our days were long our nights no longer
Count the seconds, watching 
hours
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time
[Verse 3]
In Santa Barbara, Hannah cried
"I miss those freezing beaches"
And I walked into town
To buy some kindling for the fire
Hannah tore the New York Times up into pieces
[Chorus 2] (x2)
If I can't trust you then damn it Hannah
There's no future, there's no answer
Though we live on the US dollar
You and me, we got our own sense of time

Holiday, oh, a holiday
And the best one of the year
Dozing off underneath my sheets
While I cover both my ears
But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fears?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear
Holiday, still so far away
A republic on the beach
I can't forget just how bad it gets
When I'm counting on my teeth
[Hook]
But if I wait for a holiday
Could it stop my fears?
To go away on a summer's day
Never seemed so clear
A vegetarian since the invasion
She'd never seen the word "bombs"
She'd never seen the word bombs blown up to 96-point Futura
She'd never seen an AK in a yellowy Day-Glo display
A T-shirt so lovely, it turned all the history books grey
I got wheels, 
I got Cutter spray
And a healthy sense of worth
Half of me is the gasoline
But the other half's the surf
[Hook]

In December, drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs
 
that pinch at your sandals
In December, drinking horchata
Look down your glasses at that Aranciata
With lips and teeth to ask how my day went
Boots and fists to pound on the pavement
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
You'd remember drinking horchata
You'd still enjoy it with your foot on Masada
Winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs
 
that pinch at your sandals
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh you had it but oh no you lost it
Looking back you shouldn't have fought it
In December, drinking horchata
I'd look psychotic in a balaclava
But winter's cold is too much to handle
Pincher crabs
 
that pinch at your sandals
Years go by and hearts start to harden
Those palms and firs that grew in your garden
Are falling down and nearing the rosebeds
The roots are shooting up through the tool shed
Those lips and teeth that asked how my day went
Are shouting up through cracks in the pavement
Here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten
Chairs to sit and sidewalks to walk on
Oh you had it but oh no you lost it
Looking back you shouldn't have fought it

[Verse 1]
You torched a Saab like a pile of leaves
I'd gone to find some better wheels
Four, five meters running round the bend
When the government agents surround you again
[Hook]
If 
Diane Young
 
won't change your mind
Baby, baby, baby, baby right on time
[Verse 2]
Out of control but you're 
playing a role
Do you think you can go til the 18th hole
Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship?
Try to go it alone on your own for a bit
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Baby baby baby baby ride on
Baby baby baby baby ride on
Baby baby baby it’s a light on
Baby baby baby it’s a lifetime
Baby baby baby baby ride on
Time, time, time, time, time, time
Baby baby baby baby ride on time
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Irish and proud, baby, naturally
But you got the luck of a Kennedy
So grab the wheel, keep on holding it tight
'Til you're tottering off into that goodnight
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Breakdown]
Nobody knows what the future holds
And it’s bad enough just getting old
Live my life in self-defense
You know I love the past, ’cause I hate suspense...
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Hudson died in Hudson Bay
The water took its victim's name
The river's rise
 told 
Riverside
 to change their names again
A stranger walked in through the door
Said all apartments are pre-war
We laughed and asked him for his name
He stayed until the end
We watched the Germans play the Greeks
We marked the 99 year lease
Our fathers signed
Which I declined to try and comprehend
[Chorus]
Over and over again, all these never-ending visions
Over and over again like a prize that's changing hands
The time has a come
The clock is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag
The legendary wooden gate
The first established real estate
Is lost in time like all the crimes that won this pleasant land (land, land)
[Chorus]
Hudson died on Hudson Bay
But I was born on Sutton Place
The rising tide helped me decide to change my name again
Some men tend to linger on
 and 
some make haste from Babylon
Some will roam their ruined home, rejoicing 'till the end
[Chorus]
The lines are drawn
The map is such a drag
All you who changed your stripes can wrap me in the flag

Chorus
When I see your long black hair in the shower
Baby girl it feels just like you’re at home
When I see your plate left out on the table
Baby girl I know I’m never alone
When I see your long black hair in the shower
Baby girl it feels just like you’re at home
Baby girl you’re talkin’ and I will be listenin’
But some thing I just can’t tell from your tone
Verse 1 (Andrew Kalaidjian)
Funny how it started we were both a little bothered
By the warning signs the ones behind the subtle vision
Still I had to make you mine
I got no time for big decisions
Rather call it on the moment
Well won’t it be better bring just a minute
Seconds start with just a distance
Past the hour
Faster now we’re
After hour
April showers
How your long black hair
Is at home
I planted these flowers
And just look how high they have grown
Chorus
When I see your long black hair in the shower
Baby girl it feels just like you’re at home
When I see your plate left out on the table
Baby girl I know I’m never alone
When I see your long black hair in the shower
Baby girl it feels just like you’re at home
Baby girl you’re talkin’ and I will be listenin’
But some things I just can’t tell from your tone
Verse 2 (Ezra Factory)
From here to Texas
Girls call me sexist
‘Cause I airbrushed your breasts
On the top of my lexus
But it’s just ’cause I fell in love with your solar plexus
Your ribcage and your beaded necklace
So
So tell me what you wanna do
‘Cause another cup of cinnamon is comin’ through
I’m not Napoleon, I Waterloo
L’Homme Run got feelings too
And you 
pretty pretty pretty girls
 who sing
Are
The last thing that a guy like me wanna get inside his car
Chorus
When I see your long black hair in the shower
Baby girl it feels just like you’re at home
When I see your plate left out on the table
Baby girl I know I’m never alone
When I see your long black hair in the shower
Baby girl it feels just like you’re at home
Baby girl you’re talkin’ and I will be listenin’
But some thing I just can’t tell from your tone

You've been checking on my facts
And I admit I have been lax
In double-screening what I say
It wasn't funny anyway
I stand corrected
No one cares when you are wrong
But I've been at this far too long
To act like that when we should be
In perfect harmony
I stand corrected
Lord knows I haven't tried
I'll take my stand
One last time
Forget the protocol
I'll take your hand
Right in mine

I had a feeling once
That you and I
Could tell each other everything
For two months
But even with an oath
With truth on our side
When you turn away from me
It’s not right
I think you're a contra
My revolution thoughts
Your little arrows of desire
I want to trace them to the source
And the wire
But it’s not useful now
Since we’ve both made up our minds
You’re going to watch out for yourself
And so will I
I think you're a contra
And I think that you’ve lied
Don’t call me a contra
Till you’ve tried
You wanted good schools and friends with pools
You’re not a contra
You wanted rock and roll, complete control
Well, I don’t know
Never pick sides
Never choose between two
Well I just wanted you
I just wanted you
You said
“Never pick sides
Never choose between two”
Well I just wanted you
I just wanted you
I think 
you're
 a contra
And I think that you’ve lied
Don’t call me a contra
Till you’ve tried

It's going to take a little time
While you're waiting like a factory line
I'll ride across the park
Backseat on the 79
Wasted days you've come to pass
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Pollination yellow cab
You walk up the stairs
See the French kids by the door
Up one more flight
See the Buddha on the second floor
Combination rickshaw grab
So go, I know you would not stay
It wasn't true, but anyway
Racist dreams you should not have
No excuse to be so callous
Dress yourself in bleeding madras
Charm your way across the Khyber pass
Stay awake to break the habit
Sing in praise of Jackson Crowther
Watch your step along the arch of glass

[Verse 1]
Morning’s come, you've watched the red sun rise
The LED still flickers in your eyes
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
No one’s gonna watch you as you go
From a house you didn’t build and can’t control
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
You ought to spare the world your labor
It’s been twenty years and no one’s told the truth
[Hook x2]
So listen, oh
So listen, oh
Don’t wait
Don’t wait
[Verse 2]
So keep that list of who to thank in mind
And don’t forget the rich ones who were kind
Oh you ought to spare your face the razor
Because no one’s gonna spare their time for you
Why don’t you spare their world a traitor
Take your wager back and leave before you lose
[Hook]
[Bridge]
So while the sun’s coming out
Cover ground, cover ground
And if you find some love for these clowns
Turn around, turn around
I’ll be half asleep on the floor of a high school gym
Thinking of you and wondering if anyone else could begin
[Pre-Hook]
To listen
Listen
Don’t wait
Don’t wait
[
Hook]

Occident out on the weekend
That's the way that we relax
English breakfast tastes like Darjeeling
But she's too cute to even ask
Blake's got a new face (Blake's got a new face)
Nastiness will cause your doom
Turn and walk back to your room
The precedent's already set now
You spend a week in old San Juan
Spanish brownstone with chairs of leather
And Spanish waves to roll along
Majesty's not overheard
Cryptographs can't stand the word
Oh your collegiate grief has left you dowdy in sweatshirts
Absolute horror!

Ottoman couch
, 
how handsome your furniture
Lovelier now, but dressed for a funeral
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall
Elegant clothes you want to be seen with her
Under your tweeds you sweat like a teenager
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall
Today is for you
They laid it out for you
For you
There will be 
six bells a-ringing
 and 
white women
 singing for you
But this feels so unnatural to Peter Gabriel, too
All of the cards and all of the time it took
Soon it's all lines read in a leather book
Begging you to wait for a minute by the door
Your creeping feet where they've never been before
Today is for you
They laid it out for you
For you
There will be six bells a-ringing and white women singing for you
But this feels so unnatural to Peter Gabriel, too

Who gives a fuck
 about 
an Oxford comma?
I've seen those English dramas too
They're cruel
So if there's any other way
To spell the word
It's fine with me, with me
Why would you speak to me that way
Especially when I always said that I
Haven't got the words for you
All your diction dripping with disdain
Through the pain
I always tell the truth
Who gives a fuck about an Oxford comma?
I climbed to Dharamsala too
I did
I met the highest lama
His accent sounded fine
To me, to me
Check your handbook
It's no trick
Take the chapstick
Put it on your lips
Crack a smile
Adjust my tie
Know your boyfriend, unlike other guys
Why would you lie about how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
First the window, then it's to the wall
Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth
Check your passport
It's no trick
Take the chapstick
Put it on your lips
Crack a smile
Adjust my tie
Know your butler, unlike other guys
Why would you lie about how much coal you have?
Why would you lie about something dumb like that?
Why would you lie about anything at all?
First the window, then it's through the wall
Why would you tape my conversations?
Show your paintings
At the United Nations
Lil' Jon, he always tells the truth

P-I-Z-Z-A-P-AR-T-Y
If you got a blunt then we can get high
If you wanna come then pick up the phone
Don't get caught with a wack calzone
 [x2]
Hey yo Tony where'd you get that fresh pepperoni
Your toppings are ill but your cheese is hole-y
Only order one slice when you're feeling lonely
Cos the sausage tastes like stale bologna
Still better than nothin', you're feelin' alright
You know my girl eats her pizza with a diet sprite
Order garlic knots, and she'll stay the night
Getting crazy with the spinach when my pie is white
In France they eat pizza like 
'oh mon dieu
C'est la plus belle pizza que j'ai jamais vu
Le fromage est frais, c'est vraiment mieux
Que le dernier film de Gérard Depardieu
Yo fuck that I don't eat my pizza with brie
Or escargot
Or duck confit
A hot slice in my hands, no cutlery
At the P-I-Z-Z-A party
P-I-Z-Z-A-P-AR-T-Y
If you got a blunt then we can get high
If you wanna come then pick up the phone
Don't get caught with a wack calzone [2x]
Man if you don’t know by now, don't bother to question
Cos I'm too damn stoned and I lost my direction
Wait a minute [what up]
I got a make a correction
I'm at the pizza party, and I'm eatin' hearty
“It could be mighty meaty or with havarti
Man I don’t want no ziti or chicken parm
I'm-a heat up this slice like Don Giovanni
Cold pizza in the morning never did no harm
For that hangover son, it works like a charm
So if it ain't in a box, it ain't on my table
I can say it in German as best as I'm able
“Lass uns gemütlich zusammen sitzen”
Let's get together for some good pizza eatin'
And you can leave your wallet cos I am treatin'
But B-Y-O-B, cos man, I ain't treatin'
At the P-I-Z-Z-A-P-AR-T-Y
If you got a blunt then we can get high
If you wanna come then pick up the phone
Don't get caught with a wack calzone [2x]
Now here is a story that must be told
About two hot pizzas that got mad cold
Cos I don't eat Foges, I won't touch Elio's
Wacker than a girl who says 'what the dealio'
It's not delivery, it's L'Homme Run
So don't touch my plate 'til I'm done
I move oregano by the ton
Cos you know the factory is number one
Now the year’s ’94 and my trunk is closed
In my rearview mirror, motherfucking Domino’s
I’m just drivin’, within the legal limit
Pizza boy gotta move two pies in twenty minutes
I try to pull over, but not in time
I get hit from the back, but I’m still fine
Pizza boy was bleedin’ – shard of glass in his head
I straight jacked his pizzas and left him for dead
--clatter, voices--
[What….whaaaaat]
How'm I supposed to cut with this plastic cutlery
Pizza supreme and you know I got the dream
Like the breadsticks and the way you lick your lips
When I say consumption now I don't want to eat later
When I say destruction now I don't want no peace, hater
Madame ?
I want to wrap you up in, carnal embrace
Let's face the fact, it's true, I've got no romantic garden
Call me rather render cinderblock shit how hard
And then compassion how
I work for passion now
Today you know my face but tomorrow I'll displace
Into a more socially accepted workplace
Color sublimation, let Freud take vacation
And then bring him back
, smokin' fat Haitians
Sit him on my couch, prop him so he don't slouch
Alienated man, stand don't crouch
And then ask '
biiitch, why the fuuuck
Are you such a pessimist'
That's the real opiate
--rewind--
P-I-Z-Z-A-P-AR-T-Y
If you got a blunt then we can get high
If you wanna come then pick up the phone
Don't get caught with a wack calzone [3x]

Every dollar counts
And every morning hurts
We mostly work to live
Until we live to work
She said
, 
"You know, there's nowhere else to go."
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run
Worlds away from cars
And all the stars in bars
Where a little bit of condensation means so much
And a little bit of change is all your little fingers touch
I said, "You know, there's nowhere else to go."
But changing roles
It struck me that the two of us could run
Cause honey with you
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two
But I really couldn't ever know
Honey with you
And a little battered radio
We could try
So lead my feet away
Cause all they do is stay
And I don't think your eyes
Have ever looked surprised
She said, "You know, there's nowhere left to go."
But with her fund
It struck me that the two of us could run
Cause honey with you
Is the only honest way to go
And I could take two
If I really couldn't ever know
Honey with you
And battered radio
We could try

Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl
[Verse 1]
Back back way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg
 
Anchorage
 and 
Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and walkman
I was a hoarder but girl that was back then
[Chorus]
The gloves are off,
 
the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
, 
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
, 
I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl
[Verse 2]
Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus
, 
she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to 
the sound of the master
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor - it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, 
the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl - you're not old yet
[Chorus]

Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl
[Verse One: Danny Brown]
Back back way back I used to front like I was Don Juan
Couldn't settle down, couldn't find a girl to hold on
Used to get my roll on, hit the spots and stroll on
Now I found one with a hand I like to hold on
Every time I'm with her, dudes always wanna stare
I be staring back like, "you don't wanna go there."
Used to didn't care,
 
now I hit you with a chair
If it just so happen, touch a string on her hair
Now me and shorty wop spending more and more time
So since she got my heart then I gotta have her spine
And if any dude try to come for what's mine? -
A pair of size 9's where the sun don't shine
The sugar in my Kool-Aid - boo gets me through days
Swear to God, one day I might watch her throw a bouquet
Said, "Nowhere on this earth. Nowhere in this world
I should ever ever ever see you stepping to my girl."
[Verse Two: Heems]
That's my old girl, my old girl from college
I always think about her when the leaves turn orange
Yeah, we went to Wesleyan and she scoffed at Vassar
I met her at a wine and cheese, I looked right past her
Apparently, she would notify me right after
I smashed her the first night
The first pipe's the worst pipe
But after I satisfied thirst like "Mmm"
The pastor would satisfy the church like
She lived in 
WestCo
 and 
studied frescoes
And head to toes, she stayed in the best clothes
I represent Queens, she would move out to Brooklyn
Never thought that she would have her 
 
took-en
By a shy, brown guy from
 
Bellerose
That stayed in shell-toes, until Hell froze
Her freckles dance on her porcelain skin
It's like, she's got a 
 within
And I been high, but ain't no higher place
Than alongside her by the fireplace
[Verse Three: Despot]
Act like you ain't even seen me standing next to her
I'll tie your kicks together if you ever try to step to her
Must be why you trippin' when I ask you
, "Why you stressin' her?"
Passing notes and texting her, I'm 'bout to shoot the messenger
Used to smash, slap 'em on the ass and go away
They ask when Imma call 'em and I hit 'em with a poker face
Coldest shoulder known to blow a load then leave 'em froze and skate
Magnum wrapper in the trash, I told them,
 
"Nothing gold can stay."
Who's she? Guess I turned over a 
Now I'm choosing groups A thru D over groupies
Lose sleep, lately only counting on these two sheep
You and me, baby, skipping town up on these coupe seats
Must've broke the mold when they made you
Probably broke a nail or two flippin' off these lame dudes
Hollerin' in plain view, on some, "what's your name, boo?"
Barely had a dollar and a dream, but it came true
[Hook]
The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones, I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a Modest Mouse, I can't do it alone, I can't do it alone
Every time I see you in the world, you always step to my girl

Unsentimental
Traveling Around
Sure of myself
Sure of it now
But you were standing there so close to me
Like the future was supposed to be
In the aisles of the grocery
And the blocks uptown
I remember
Remember it well
But if I'd forgotten
Could you tell?
In the shadow of your first attack
I was questioning and looking back
You said, "Baby, we don't speak of that"
Like a real aristocrat
Compound to compound
Lazy and safe
Wanted to leave it
Wanted to wait
When the taxi door was open wide
I pretended I was horrified
By the uniform and gloves outside
Of the courtyard gate
You're not a victim
But neither am I
Nostalgic for garbage;
Desperate for time
I could blame it on your mother's hair
Or the colors that your father wears
But I know that I was never fair
You were always fine

A devastating backstroke
All the way from France
With shiny, shiny cufflinks
A shirtsleeve to enhance
The pin-striped men of morning
Are coming for to dance
With pure Egyptian Cotton
The kids don't stand a chance
You criticize the practice
By murdering their plants
Ignoring all the history
Denying them romance
The pin-striped men of morning
Coming forward to dance
Forty-million dollars
The kids don't stand a chance
I didn't like the business
But that was at first glance
Your pillow feels so soft now
But still you must advance
The pin-striped men of morning
The partners in the danc
e
The paper's shot to pieces
The kids don't stand a chance

[Verse 1]
Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who’s going to save a little warmth for me
[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train
[Verse 2]
If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who’s going to say a little grace for me?
[Pre-Chorus]
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl you and I will die unbelievers bound to the tracks of the train
[Chorus]
I’m not excited but should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you and you love the sea
But what holy water contains a little drop, little drop for me
[Verse 3]
See the sun go down, it’s going on down when the night is deep
Want a little light but who’s going to save a little light for me?
[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus x2
]
If I’m born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who’s going to say a little grace for me?

[Hook 1]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, Mystic Seaport is that way
Don't you know that your life could be lost out of Cape Cod tonight?
[Hook 2]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, the bottleneck is a shit show
Hyannisport is a ghetto
, out of Cape Cod tonight
[Verse 1]
The lobster's claw is sharp as knives
Evil feasts on human lives
The Holy Roman Empire roots for you
[Chorus]
Walcott, all the way to New Jersey
All the way to the Garden State, out of Cape Cod tonight
[Verse 2]
Walcott, fuck the women from Wellfleet
Fuck the bears out in Provincetown
Heed my words and take flight
[Hook 3]
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?
Walcott, don't you know that it's insane?
Don't you want to get out of Cape Cod, out of Cape Cod tonight?

An ancient business
A modern piece of glass work
Down on the corner that you walk each day in passing
The elderly sales clerk won't eye us with suspicion
The whole, immortal corporation's given its permission
A little stairway
A little piece of carpet
A pair of mirrors that
Are facing one another
Out in both directions
A thousand little Julias
That come together
In the middle of Manhattan
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once
Around the corner
The house that modern art built
I ask for modern art
To keep it out the closets
The people who might own it
The sins of pride and envy
And on the second floor
The Richard Serra Skate Park
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once
Sit on 
the park wall
Ask all the right questions
Why are the horses racing taxis in the winter?
Look up at the buildings imagine who might live there
Imagining your wolfords in a ball upon the sink there
You waited since lunch
It all comes at once

Only in the way you want it
Only on the day you want it
Only with the understanding: every single day you want it
[X2]
You, you
City with the weight upon it
City in the way you want it
City with the safety of a never-ending blessing on it
[X2]
You, you
[Chorus]
We worshipped you
Your red right hand
Won't we see you once again?
In foreign soil, in foreign land
Who will guide us through the end?
Calling on a change, you want it
Calling on the same, you want it
Calling for the misery to always be explained,
 you want it
[X2]
You, you
Energetic praise you wanted
Any kind of praise you wanted
Little bit of light to get us through the final days you wanted
[X2]
You, too
[Chorus x2]

[Verse 1]
Oh, sweet thing
Zion doesn't love you
And Babylon don't love you
But you love everything
Oh, you saint
America don't love you
So I could never love you
In spite of everything
[Pre-Chorus]
In the dark of this place
There's the glow of your face
There's the dust on the screen
Of this broken machine
And I can't help but feel
That I've made some mistake
But I let it go
Ya Hey
 (x3)
[Chorus]
Through the fire and through the flames
(Ya hey x2, 
Ut Deo,
 ya hey x2)
You won't even say your name
(Ya hey x2, Ut Deo, ya hey x2)
Through the fire and through the flames
You won't even say your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey x2)
Ut Deo, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, Deo
[Verse 2]
Oh, the motherland don't love you
The fatherland don't love you
So why love anything?
Oh, good God
The faithless they don't love you
The zealous hearts don't love you
And that's not gonna change
[Pre-Chorus]
All the cameras and files
All the paranoid styles
All the tension and fear
Of a secret career
And I can't help but feel
That you seen the mistakes
But you let it go
Ya Hey (x3)
[Chorus]
[Middle 8]
Outside the tents, on the festival grounds
As the air began to cool, and the sun went down
My soul swooned, as I faintly heard the sound
Of you 
spinning "Israelites"
Into 
"19th Nervous Breakdown"
[Chorus]
[Refrain]
Through the fire 
and through the
 flames
You won't even say your name
Only "I am that I am"
But who could ever live that way?
(Ya Hey x2)
Ut Deo
, Ya Hey
Ut Deo, 
Deo Annotate

I see a Mansard roof through the trees
I see a salty message written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet
The hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings
I can see them too
I see a Mansard roof through the trees
I see 
a salty message
 written in the eaves
The ground beneath my feet
The hot garbage and concrete
And now the tops of buildings
I can see them too
The Argentines collapse in defeat
The admiralty surveys the remnants of the fleet
The ground beneath their feet
Is a nautically-mapped sheet
As thin as paper
While it slips away from view

I. Influences (1984-2005)
Numerous interviewers over the years have coaxed Ezra Koenig into 
discussing his musical influences
. And he seems to enjoy talking about childhood love for rap and wordplay quite a bit! Koenig's parents, his father in particular, bought records including 
Tom Tom Club
 (really the first white rappers, influenced by Jamaican sound clashes) and 
Run-DMC.
 Said father, a movie set designer, brought a young Koenig on the set of Spike Lee's Malcolm X when it was filming in New York City
By early high school, he got into 
A Tribe Called Quest
 and 
Jay-Z
 and began to immerse himself in the New York canon, though his tastes were far more eclectic than that would suggest, e.g. Three Six Mafia (and later, in college, UK rap like Dizzee Rascal and The Streets). Koenig wasn't averse to popular rap, either: He and music writer Jonah Weiner, he of "no 'no homo'" with the rap alias Spiderfang, once discussed covering Pimp C's verse on "Big Pimpin'" on Twitter. His romantic associations with many of these purchases are still available on a blog he wrote as a senior in college called 
Internet Vibes
. On there, Koenig's enthusiasm for bachata and dancehall is very evident. The latter is a huge influence on Modern Vampires of the City. Though Koenig admits he sounds young on there, it still has a lot of great information and fans !
Koenig, who is said to have written his Columbia admissions essay about Nick Drake, told the Nerdist podcast that he wrote and recorded a rap album in high school that not even he owns. And he has likened British New Wave artists like Elvis Costello, Squeeze, and Nick Lowe to their own rap sub-genre. He seems to be referring to their dense internal rhyme about class scrappiness. Compare a verse Koenig once cited from Costello's "The Loved Ones" ("Don't get smart or sarcastic/He snaps back just like elastic/Spare us the theatrics and the verbal gymnastics/We break wise guys just like matchsticks") to "Check your handbook, it's no trick/Take the chapstick, put it on your lips/Crack a smile, adjust my tie" in "Oxford Comma," which otherwise recalls Costello's "This Year's Girl." He eschews popular Squeeze ("Tempted") for deeper cuts, but "Cool for Cats" is among their better known songs for the vibe he's talking about
For Pitchfork's 5-10-15-20 series, Koenig told Tom Breihan that a high school friend got him into De La Soul, Digable Planets, and a Tribe Called Quest. From there, he immersed himself in early Nineties rap. Working later at the Walkmen's Harlem studio, and as an intern at Hoboken's WFMU, Koenig listened to demo tapes that probably gave him a pretty good idea of what he wanted in his own sound. In 2003, Koenig praised the "fucked-up version of American music" of Dave Longstreth of Dirty Projectors, who later attributed inspirations from Beyonce's B'Day and Afropop while writing Rise Above and the New Attitude EP. Koenig and Batmanglij toured in support of those records with Longstreth and with Jona Bechtolt of YACHT, whose beat production has been compared to that of Timbaland
II. L'Homme Run (2004-2006)
At Columbia, Koenig, Chris Tomson, and their friend Andrew Kalaidjian (now a PhD candidate in English literature) performed 
local shows as L'Homme Run
 -- still on MySpace! -- and insisted the project was meant to be funny but emphatically not satirical -- a "serious" rap group, in other words. They recorded 
"Bitches,"
 
"Interracial Dating,"
 and 
"Pizza Party."
 They also recorded "Giving Up Da Gun," which became "Giving Up The Gun" in more or less identical form. (If anyone has lyrics and mp3s for other work, please post on Rap Genius!) "Pizza Party" specifically bites Jay-Z's "99 Problems" and the Beastie Boys' "Paul Revere." Vampire Weekend is far more like the Beastie Boys than what Carles of Hipster Runoff once called "white man's indie" after Kanye's My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy received a 10 from Pitchfork. Koenig seems indebted to MCA in particular and tweeted a lyric from "Bodhisattva Vow" ("in times of doubt I can think on the dharma/and the Enlightened Ones who've graduated samsara") on the day of his death
Koenig's own emcee name was Ezra Factory. "I thought you could look at it in a few different ways," he said in 2010. "A factory that produces Ezra because 
my shit is so hot.
 And I liked the reference to Factory Records, which is, of course, a very cool [former] record label in the history of rock." That's a reference to Factory Records, a Manchester, England-based level at the forefront of British punk and New Wave
"I still to this day get the most inspiration from rap lyrics," he said
Vampire Weekend's first magazine cover story in SPIN, which appeared before the official release of the first album, mentions 
L'Homme Run
. Supposedly there is still a Lacoste alligator L'Homme Run logo airbrushed on a Columbia dorm
Discovery, Batmanglij's R&B side project with Koenig's longtime friend Wes Miles of Ra Ra Riot, is analogous. Angel Deradoorian of Dirty Projectors sings a very Dirty Projectors circa B'Day influence R&B hook on "I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend," and Koenig guests on "Carby." "Slang Tang" is named for "Sleng Teng," a computerized Jamaican riddim
III. Vampire Weekend (2006-2008)
The first Vampire Weekend single, "Ladies of Cambridge," is really a ska cut, but tracks ee cummings' "The ladies of cambridge who live in furnished souls." Koenig seems drawn to proto-rap free verse like that and William Carlos Williams. (Strangely, the band almost never refers to the Columbia rap of/on the Beats.) The epiphanic quality of the New Yorky lyrics is also reminiscent of Frank O'Hara's Lunch Poems -- and everything to everyone, which is the whole problem in writing about this band. Let the stuff wash over you, or don't. Simon Reynolds called the band "everywhere/everywhen pop" in his book Retromania
It would be useless at this point to rehash complaints about the band's cultural appropriations, which seem to have originated in an essay by Charles Mudede for the Stranger about nostalgia for garbage in "Mansard Roof." Jessica Hopper, writing for the Chicago Reader would later reignite the discussion in her review of Contra, to which Nitsuh Abebe responded in New York magazine. Koenig read the Abebe essay and mentioned it several times online, as if simpatico. Cataloging Paul Simon and Talking Heads callbacks--recall, though, that Tom Tom Club was a Talking Heads side project and both did spoken-word over breakbeats--is similarly fruitless. For the purposes of this overview, it's worth mentioning (the band hasn't) that a few reviewers have likened Koenig's lyrics to Donald Fagen of Steely Dan
Like Koenig, Fagen is a New York Jewish graduate of a New York school,
 dark and oblique and relentlessly specific, not too wed to pop form but accessible nonetheless. 
Steely Dan was essential to the history of sampling
, and "Black Cow" is immortalized on "Deja Vu." 
Listen to Donald Fagen rap "Uptown, baby!" to his own hook here!
 Koenig is a better rapper
While touring in support of the EP in 2007, Vampire Weekend played a number of shows with Harlem Shakes, a likeminded experimental pop band from New York (who, full disclosure, went to college with the RapGenius founders and told Koenig about Rap Genius in late 2009 or early 2010 when it was still called Rap Exegesis). Harlem Shakes lyricist Alexander Benaim, whose father is the organic chemist and perfumier behind luxury cologne hip-hop standards like Ralph Lauren Polo, often discussed how rap operated in his writing. He reminisced about "singin' UGK forever," complained "I don't even know what I'm in the game for," and reverted to hip-hop-like cadences in his him-esque lyrics (say, the staccato of "you say I'm blind and deaf and dumb, your gamesomeness a loaded gun/you guard your nerves like they're your sons"). Benaim and Koenig also shared an allegiance to rhyme in pop songwriting, which was not popular among most Brooklyn bands that came up with them. One New York Press profile recounted Harlem Shakes and Vampire Weekend discussing the gender politics of Wu-Tang and joking about Benaim and Koenig forming a Gnarls Barkley-style hip-hop collaboration. They also dabbled with publishing a music magazine along the lines of Internet Vibes, like a less stuffy n+1 or New York Review of Books (for which Benaim was once an intern). The publication would connections between rap and global politics. For whatever reason, it never materialized. Soon after, Vampire Weekend opened for the Clipse at Columbia, and the Vampire Weekend caricature most listeners know emerged
At the time, Koenig had recently resigned from a two-year do-or-die contract with Teach for America to teach middle school English and social studies teacher at JHS 263 in Bedford-Stuyvesant. He has said that "The Kids Don't Stand a Chance" is not explicitly based on the classroom, but initially reflected his ambivalence about college friends going into finance careers. While TFA was hardly Koenig's first encounter with poverty, it impressed on him enough that he rarely addresses the experience in interviews. TFA is a polarizing organization, one known for encouraging teachers to incorporate hip-hop inspired chants written by Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) charter school leaders into classroom materials to amp up student participation and compliance with disciplinary plans. So you can forgive listeners for wondering how the experience might have influenced his bona fides. His former students teased him as "K-No" and doubted his cred until Koenig resigned and several attended early Vampire Weekend shows. The New York Times reported nonetheless that Koenig is now working with The Kid Mero, a former paraprofessional in the New York City public schools, on a treatment for a screenplay about teaching. As it happens, there is also a Teach for America rap on Rap Genius, as performed by Steve Zahn on David Simon's Treme
Aside from the "Get Low" bite on "Oxford Comma," the hip-hop influences on the Vampire Weekend EP are less overt. Listeners have sampled it and mashed it up with Jay-Z, among others, anyway. The most immediate is probably the opening to "Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa" ("As a young girl, Louis Vuitton/And your mother, on a sandy lawn/As a sophomore, with the reggaeton/And the linens you're sittin' on"). Though LV is an eternal luxury brand, it was a particularly potent namedrop then, following the ubiquitous appearances of the funfetti Murakami purse print in photographs of celebrities like Paris Hilton and Kanye West. As for reggaeton, that is just ambient music in Washington Heights, the neighborhood directly adjacent to Morningside Heights, where Koenig lived for several years. The rise of Vampire Weekend roughly coincided with the ubiquity of "Gasolina" by Daddy Yankee, which still dame the creeps. While on tour for this record, Koenig, putting the frontin' in frontispiece, also asked Asher Roth to autograph 
his copy of The Razor's Edge by Somerset Maugham
.
IV. Contra (2010)
Vampire Weekend considered titling Contra "Young Money" after yuppies, "Bedrock," and whatever other associations you can make of that. They changed their minds after Koenig met with a musician he admired, the Scottish-Japanese performance artist (
don't ask! ask!
) Momus, who, like Koenig, is a kind of pop ethnographer. Music critics came over, and to, the band's genre-hopping, including, rimshot, hip-hop
The "Horchata" freestyle may have originated in his English classroom. It has elements of Kanye West's "Coldest Winter" ("winter's cold is too much to handle") or Eric B. and Rakim's "I Know You Got Soul" ("here comes a feeling you thought you'd forgotten" versus "it's been a long time, shouldn't have left you") Koenig once told the New York Times that Kanye won him over on 808s and Heartbreak, whereas the rest of the band was already on board
On "California English," "livin' like the French Connection but we'll die in LA" evokes William Friedkin's gangster movies. In a 2008 New York Times profile, Koenig bought another gangster movie, New Jack City. The Contra B-side "Giant" is an homage to "Envy Me" by The Game and 50 Cent and begins with a nod to Biggie's "Juicy" ("It was all a dream/I used to read Thrasher magazine") A fan made a "Giving up the Sunshowers" remix with the M.I.A. track
You could argue that "Cousins" is a diss track to ether Koenig's haters. The video was filmed in New York's Cortlandt Alley (Chinatown/TriBeCa), former home of the Mudd Club and one of the last few really "street" looking places in the whole city. Koenig has said that his father used to go to the Mudd Club, to which he also seems to allude on "Giving Up the Gun" ("I heard you played guitar/at a city bar/where skinheads used to fight"). He has said that the song was otherwise inspired by his father, who gave him a book with the title. Rostam Batmanglij's favorite artist is Jean-Michel Basquiat, also a Mudd Club regular, as was much of the early hip-hop scene (hence the earlier connection between rap and Tom Tom Club). A reader of a ScoutingNY blog even asked if MC Hammer's "Turn This Mutha Out" was filmed there--it may have been ! The "Cousins" video was thought to have ripped off tape art by the Brooklyn artist Aakash Nihalani, who soon afterward designed the Das Racist Shut Up, Dude album cover. And yet fans balked when RZA and Li'l Jon appeared in the "Giving Up The Gun" video. What you on about?!
In "Diplomat's Son," probably the most obvious predecessor to the rap referents in "Step," the band samples M.I.A. ("Hussel") and Toots and the Maytals ("Pressure Drop," also covered by The Specials and The Clash). The diplomat's son in question is the character in the song, drawn from fiction Koenig wrote as a senior in college, as well as Joe Strummer of The Clash, but could just as well be The Diplomats. The members of Vampire Weekend were living in Harlem at the height of Dipset's influence, though they have never talked about them too extensively. Dipset had an enormous cult following among Ivy League English and philosophy majors, who marveled at Cam'ron's insane version of scansion. Koenig's flow here even begins to resemble one of his other favorite rappers, 
Fabolous
, when he says "Cause I'm gonna take it from Simon/If I ever had a chance, it's now then."
Now, a moment for us: At a March 2010 promotional event for *Contra* at the New York Public Library, Koenig said he read Rap Genius and discussed his longtime love of the mealtime verse of "Rapper's Delight." Apparently, he preferred the name Rap Exegesis (so did I, son). "What is 'Rapper's Delight' all about?' he asked. "It's something that I thought about since I was 12. It's about sex in one verse, and there's also the verse about 'Did you ever go to a friend's house to eat, and the food just ain't no good.' To me that's a fundamentally different way of thinking about lyrics than what came before."
Like Koenig, Sugar Hill Gang was the brainchild of an appropriator from northern New Jersey, but you like that record, don't you?
V. Modern Vampires of the City (2013)
Koenig has talked a lot about the album title, a reference to Junior Reid's "One Blood." He was interested in bringing even more dancehall and hip-hop elements to the album, citing Horace Andy as an influence in one interview, but was denied. The most cited rap reference on this record, "Ya Hey" as a "Hey Ya" joke, is in fact NOT a deliberate influence: Ezra Koenig told Time Out Kuala Lumpur that it was NOT a reference to "Hey Ya," but that he nonetheless once had a quasireligious experience hearing "Hey Ya" for the first time while driving a car. He compared the experience to Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys hearing "The Lion Sleeps Tonight" in a car, with the whole hymnlike or folksong like quality and cultural appropriation angle
This album better reflects the influence of epiphanic works of fiction like James Joyce's 
*Dubliners*
, which Koenig has said was one of his favorite books from high school. "My soul swooned when I faintly heard the sound" on "Ya Hey" parallels the final sentence of Joyce's "The Dead." Remember when Beck rapped about James Joyce on "Que Onda Guero?" 
And who raps better than *James Joyce*?!
 How is the opening of *A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man* any different than "Rapper's Delight"?
A few notes on flow: The spoken-word interludes on "Ya Hey" and "Finger Back" that Rap Genius -- not the band itself ! -- lovingly called "batshit" could be from anything or anywhere. Like the speed flow on "Worship You," for example: It reminds some people of Twista or Busta Rhymes. And some "Ya Hey" listeners were reminded of Jim Morrison's languid free verse after Koenig's complaints on the press junket about feeling low in L.A. before writing it. The one in "Finger Back" is in the same incantatory monotone, but better reflects Brill Building-style "boy from the wrong side of the tracks" writing as filtered through hip-hop. (Of course, at the Brill Building Carole King and Gerry Goffin and Paul Simon and Neil Sedaka were outer borough Jews writing for African-American groups, its own political problem.) Speaking of which, could "turnaround" on "Obvious Bicycle" be connected in any way to Hall and Oates' "Las Vegas Turnaround"? They're sampled all the time! So let's pretend. Koenig once soloed on saxophone on Chromeo's H&O ho-mage "I Could Be Wrong," and the band was a huge favorite of Brooklyn indie rock stars who posted about themselves on Twitter in 2011You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion
You take your time, young lion



Got a little soul
The world is a cold, cold place to be
Want a little warmth
But who's gonna save a little warmth for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train
See the snow come down
It's coming on down from the highest peak
Want a little leaf
But who's gonna save a little leaf for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train
I'm not excited
But should I be?
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you
And you love the sea
Wonder if the water contains a little drop, little drop for me
See the sun go down
It's going on down, when the night is deep
Want a little light
But who's gonna save a little light for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train
If I'm born again I know that the world will disagree
Want a little grace but who's gonna save a little grace for me?
We know the fire awaits unbelievers
All of the sinners the same
Girl, you and I will die unbelievers
Bound to the tracks of the train
I’m not excited
But should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you
And you love the sea
Wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me
I’m not excited
But should I be
Is this the fate that half of the world has planned for me?
I know I love you
And you love the sea
Wonder if the water contains a little drop little drop for me



Last born of the clan
First one to be free
Lived inside a house
Beneath the hanging tree
Londonderry nights
That chilled him to the bone
Words were cried at night
In unforgiving tones
Blood of his men was gone beneath snow
He picked up his knife and bow
Killer of Jonathan Low
Violence from without
And Anger from within
Crawling through the fields
Informing next to kin
They all turned their backs
But they all knew his name
And if he could return
They'd probably do the same
Blood of his friends was gone beneath snow
For all that I know, he died
Killer of Jonathan Low
The blood of his friends was gone beneath snow
For all that I know, he died
Killer of Jonathan Low


According to an interview with Batmanglij and co-producer Ariel Rechtstaid ("Climax") in *Electronic Musician*, the bass drum used for the original "Apache" breakbeat can be heard on the record. Dirty Projectors had earlier covered "Climax," paving the way (of sorts) for the viral cover of "Blurred Lines." On tour, Vampire Weekend sometimes blurs numbers together with a riff from LMFAO's "Shots."
On "Don't Lie," Koenig calls his characters "youngbloods," consistent with other Rastafarian allusions to Babylon and Zion on "Ya Hey" and young lions on "Young Lion." It would be impossible to recap the history of rap and Rasta culture here, though there may be a connection to Nas and Damian Marley's *Distant Relatives* (2010), which includes a track called "Nah Mean." (Maybe "Ya Hey" sounds more like "Jah bless"--or, yeah, Yahweh.) It's not like "nah mean" is uncommon, but Damian Marley is clearly an influence on their work, as is the entire Nas catalog separately. So, why not together? Koenig likes conspiracy theories. He also gets a kick out of Five Percenters theology, a huge black nationalism trope in hip-hop best described by RZA in the Tao of Wu
The LA Review of Books compared Koenig to the hero of a picaresque. Those are rogues who get by in high class society on their wits, meaning rappers. Ergo, Vampire Weekend are rappers. Tajai of Souls of Mischief told HipHopDx he was at first skeptical of stately, plump "Step"--but you better just check out the main page for how well it, and rap, turned out. There are too many references in that to pick apart here--the original sample's history, Run-DMC's Tougher than Leather among them--and 
they turned it out
.
And 
remixed it with Heems and Despot and Danny Brown
.
