[Ill BilL]
Fuck the machine, I’m raging against the broke life
I love the cream, my sayings affect the coke price
My demons are devils to the things that I don’t like
Can I detach myself from 'em I know it’s so trife
Murder assault, wild out of control type
Worshiping at the altar of Ralph like a low life
Dress correct, heavy metal emperor roll tight
I’m obsessed with death, helter skelter like Sean Price
Know the tech kid the sound of thunder
No respectable Boba Fett like bounty hunter
No remorse, mega force records seek and destroy
We kill em all, zip up the bag, bring em to the morgue
Bring him to the coroner table then cut him up and look inside of him
What the fuck would they think if someone lied to them?
Sold em the dead dreams, listening to philosophers
Going against me? Victory is impossible
[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice
[Jus Allah]
My rap’s scary, it escaped from my Blackberry
Your rap stays trapped, it’s fake and imaginary
My rap full of gats and bad vocabulary
My rap has drug tracks and blood capillaries
It’s all cemetery, and about mortuaries
I ain’t saying anything out of the ordinary
Not unusual, it’s the cult itinerary
Attending funerals with a dull contemporary
Weapons put you in blessings whenever necessary
Gun straightened paper better than a secretary
With just one shot turn a jock into a Jerry
The Glock said we carry, turn The Rock into a fairy
Murder for no reason other than monetary
The devil made me do it, it’s involuntary
I keep clips and newspaper obituaries
Behind a bookcase with a trick dictionary
[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice
[Vinnie Paz]
It’s a perfect murder scene, a perfect murder about a perfect person
Brujeria verse perfectly cursing a virgin
What’s the faculty of energy perfect exertion
Call me majesty, my words are conversed in a serpent
Pussy boy left the war, they call it desertion
I am dirty, I am opposite in every detergent
If it isn't a Grey Goose then it’s certainly Bourbon
I write my rhyme in Beirut with a burgundy turban
Hard body rap, punch you in the chatter box
I would never walk the hallways unless I had a ox
That’s the reason why they put me in padded box
I would’ve never been a problem if I had my pops
I pull a motherfuckers card like a magic shop
Mossberg means spin several medal savage shots
The heater hit the fuckin flesh like the cattle prod
My physical body’s the vehicle for wrath of God
[Hook x2]
Blood, money and death, dark side justice
Trust nothing except, dark side justice
Fuck love and respect, dark side justice
120% dark side justice

[Ill Bill]
First and foremost, a toast to my Mom & my Pop
My daughter and my wife, there’s no one more important in my life
Without them I wouldn’t be alive in the literal sense
And in the mind, they are my inspiration to grind
My reason to live, rest in peace to my grandmothers and my uncles
Y'all molded the person I became and for that I love you
It’s difficult to explain through lyrics how much I miss you
Please accept any success I’ve achieved as a tribute
A testament to your impact
And influence on everything I’ve ever did, you’ll forever live
I never been a religious person but still bear witness to a higher power
Some only pray in their final hour
But I remain grateful for my blessings
Thankful to the most high, for the many gifts whether present
Past or futuristic, blessed to be able to express myself through words
And give thanks using the lyrics
(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
I wanna thank everyone
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
I just wanna say… thanks… thank you
[Ill Bill]
Secondly I’d like to address where it all popped
From Farragut Road to your block
Gargling booze, and saw god sparking a doob
Marketing crude, sharpening tools, we're martyrs & goon shooters
That shoot constant modern day Goose Gossage
Ice cold though, Siberian summers appear hotter
Quite bold like a Nigerian underwear bomber
Dope war, folklore, coke whore smoke more
Morbid epitaph, Sordid tortured past provoke more
Try to stab me with a knife to be exact
Spitefully attacked, trifling and wack, grimier in fact
Than any award or any rap, any whore or any rat
Close the door on petty crap
Very happy, thankful to my best of friends
Had to cut ties with any of the very many snakes in the grass that left me for dead
Dumped in the river, swept in the ocean
Heavy emotion, stand firm though the end is approaching, I’m open
(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
Ladies and gentleman, a real round of applause
Yall appointed me to bring rap justice
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
It’s truly fantastic
To show our appreciation for you
[Ill Bill]
Lastly I’d like to thank all my influences
And various inspirational individuals that got me in the music business
I
'm a fan first so I appreciate mines
Thanks to my fans, you're my family, I take pride
In your support and every album you bought
Down for life, I love y'all for never doubting your boy
Same way I love LL Cool J and Kiss
One made me wanna rock, the other made me wanna spit
Rick Rubin made me wanna flip em both at the same time
Slayer and Scarface inspired me to write insane rhymes
Thanks to L'Amours in Brooklyn accepting my fake ID
Opened for Sepultura there when I was only 17
Thanks to my band Injustice
Thanks to Ace London Studios for letting us rehearse when we ain’t have nothing
And shouts to all of yall that said I couldn’t do it
You gave me the fire to kick down the door and walk through it
(Interlude)
The winner is…
Ill Bill… number one
I feel very grateful, very humble
And I owe thanks to many, many people
I’ve waited a very long time
I dedicate this to you for believing in me
What more could I say? I wouldn’t be here today if the old school didn’t pave the way
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader
Ill Bill, rap crusader

[Verse 1]
[Ill Bill]
I’m like a Viking in a submarine, I’m a Spartan with guns and beams
Muggs and me
 
is like giving hard drugs to fiends
I be the cause of this prison riot, spawn of the Israelites
Torture you with kitchen knifes
, caught you in a pistol fight
I saw prophets tore from the fist of Christ
Propaganda brainwashes us to make us think their system’s right
I stick my finger in the dyke, plug the leak
While she sucked her teeth, look into the light, such is life
[B-Real]
So when I hold the mic frighting day and night
Might catch a case, see you in my sights, let my heater make you change your face
Make you change your ways, wishing you could change your days
The venom we spit cut your throat like a razor blade
They got hell to pay, me I got hell to raise
Looked death in the eye, he said you get a stellar gaze
He went on his way but he got stuck in the maze
Without any way to get out of this purple haze
[Hook: Ill Bill]
Evacuate the place, 
fallen angel,
 amputated saint
Trapped on a cannibal planet of hate, gang-related is their faith
Activate the tape, calculate the weight
Single-handed with the cannon in their face
Evacuate the place, fallen angel, amputated saint
Trapped on a cannibal planet of hate, gang-related is their faith
Activate the tape, calculate the weight
Single-handed with the cannon in their face
[Interlude: Ill Bill]
Abandon all hope, buy more weapons and more coke
Build yourself a bunker under your house, it’s all over
But before the CIA come to take us away
Light up some OG kush and take us out in a blaze
Abandon all hope, buy more weapons and more coke
Build yourself a bunker under your house, it’s all over
But before the CIA come to take us away
Light up some OG kush and take us out in a blaze
[Verse 2]
[Ill Bill]
I ate some brownies last week and I’ve been high for days
Should’ve known B-Real was the guy with the tray
Cheech and Chong spliff
, twist up an entire eighth
It won’t freeze your nose, the shit’ll set fire to your face
[B-Real]
We get higher in the place, still my eyes are clean
I’m the man in all black with the hashisheen
So many bags of green candy cars that lean
Got a crew so thick man we causing a scene
You tried to hit it the very moment I lit it
You shitted your pants, coughing out your lungs, bitch quit it
We got the greenery
 and the heavy machinery
And life don’t mean a thing to me, bitch enjoy the scenery
[Hook]

[Ill Bill]
I eat politicians for breakfast
Till infinity it's endless
Bill and Hillary, George Bush, everybody's gettin it
Presidents, Supreme Court Justices, and Senators
Run up in the White House
Erase people, edit them
Press delete, hit em in the chest with heat
Hail to the chief
Bullets everywhere, its beef
Violence is more American than apple pie and Soul Train
Baseball, nickel-plated nines, and cocaine
It's Ill Bill,
 
Non-Phixion
If I offended you with my words I meant it
Protected by the First Amendment
If this was Iraq I'd a been beheaded
Instead of sparkin a Dialogue
I'd be hangin in Baghdad shredded
Yeah I recognize
But if I ever disappear under mysterious pretenses
You guess why
I guess the CIA's trying to die
They wanna terrorize the kid
And fry him alive
(Chorus)
Skinheads and Black hebrews
Punk rockers and Hip-Hoppers
Street pharmacists, drug dealers, witch doctors
Rappers wearing hundred thousand dollar wrist watches
Little kids starving, the police killed his father
Rich man, poor man, civilized man, Tarzan
Who's right? fightin over God's land
American History X
Represent the future
Or know whats next
[Ill Bill]
I leave an ATF truck burning with the passengers in it
Hit it with anti-aircraft missiles with Bill's spid-it
No apologies, asking what's wrong with truth
Tell me whats wrong with the world
I'll tell you what's wrong with you
What's wrong with the youth
Brain eating, corpses,
 
and coupes
Sorcerers and spooks
Luminating torturous kooks
Murdering devils that wear police officer suits
Revolutionaries standing on street corners and stoops
I'm the reason the FBI killed JFK
The reason they have metal detectors at JFK
The reason that the Constitution no longer protects us
They don't even need a reason anymore to arrest us
Living in a state of Martial Law
Learn the arts of war
Arm yourself, marching forth into the monster's jaws
America eats its young, swallow raw
Falling through the doorway of death
Never know what we dying for
(Chorus)
[Ill Bill]
I seen spoiled kids murder they parents with shotguns
Poor kids from the hood sellin they mom's drugs
A lost generation of fools
Without a clear destination
No guidance, no rules, no education
And the older generation's no better
Matter of fact they worse
They oughta know better
These greedy motherfuckers trade blood for oil
An American graveyard on another man's soil
Makes no sense
The Roman Empire in the present tense
Murder for corporations that they represent
Whether Democrat or Republican
The same scumbag government
With scumbag ways of runnin shit
(Chorus)
(x2)

[Intro: 'Signs' sample]
The startling footage we're about to show you was photographed
By a 42 year old, Romero Valadares
This video was taken yesterday afternoon at his son's seventh birthday
In the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil
It was sent to the local news bureau there
And sent to us via satellite just a few minutes ago
All initial opinions are, this is genuine
What you're about to see, may disturb you
[Verse 1: ILL Bill]
Murder forensicles surrounded by alternative tentacles
Extraterrestrials step out of starships in pressure suits
Claiming humans were created inside of test tubes
Horrifyingly huge eye sockets resemble head wounds
Pumping the protoplasm, jello like substance
Looking like Goldblum in The Fly but more dusted
Don't trust their reptilian tongue
They come in peace is what they claim
When their true intentions are to have the world in chains
Enslaved, they came from beyond the stars, unexplainable
Religious people thought they coming was a sign from God
They thought these were the Elohim
When the first mothership arrived over the planet, it was a creepy scene
A huge hovering metal structure stretching
For over 5 miles every direction, blocking perception
Every news channel, 24 hour coverage, stopping commercials
Doctors, experts, UFOs, 
crop circles
Arguing generals in closed door meetings
Religious cults claiming to know the meaning of these beings
Many of these cults claimed to have been abducted
, probe prodded
And fist fucked and caught in the tracker beam and lifted up
Into the lab, strapped to a table, made to endure a series of tests Pushing beyond the limits of stress
Waking up in a cornfield naked, barely alive
Every inch of your body's in pain, you barely survived
Millenniums ago, star maps were drawn in sand
The meanings of the pyramids has long tortured man
Pharaohs and Hebrews, Mayans and Aztecs
Mathematically perfect architects the many gods have blessed
Hieroglyphics become the blueprint of primal physics
Pyramids buried kings, queens, tribal clerics
Radar signals from space bouncing off burnt rock
Responsible for the travelling Alien Workshop

(Hook x2)
My brain's strange from taking contaminated acid
While you be selling your soul we assassinate assassins
Am I hallucinating?
You'll see visions of death, possessed
By homicide is what I'm obsessed
Reek of puterfaction
 and drugs, the acid taste often lingers
Susan Atkins licked the blood of Sharon Tate off her fingers
Off the hand of Satan, hot corpse masturbation
Get my rocks off, sparking a golf course assassination
Pistol whip and kill the rich, triple six
Extremely horrible like a beautiful bitch with a dick
Every society receives the criminals it deserves
Subliminal with the words, and every visual's absurd
Dope dealer storm dancers rain down chronic showers
The cult leader cure cancer with hypnotic powers
Goon druggie 
tie-dyed
 
psychedelic paint job
Dune-buggy drive-bys, heretics that hate God
Red spider acid tongue, death rider, bastard son
Empire stand as one, 
Hellfire Canyon Club
Crocodile confessions occupy obsessions
We personify homicide - We're the essence
(Hook x2)
"Death To Pigs" written on the wall in blood
Pestilence and sickness the war's begun
Trippin' in a coffin numb
Lift your tongue, put this underneath
Orange Sunshine, a hundred sheets
Morbid dungeons and demons a hundred deep
Grimy tornado tyrants and independent souls
Hawaii volcano, private Jimi Hendrix shows
I’ve seen the symmetry of infinity clearly, like Timothy Leary weary
Questioning every existing theory
Then we enter to the hallways of the always
Twisted like corn-braids
Trippin' like Grateful Dead tour-dates
I seen Satan and God raping your mom
Then they all melted away in globs and claymation blobs
Simulation, Play Station, X-Box the death doctrine
Altamount angels to murder-sprees with 
Tex Watson
The shepard sent the lamb to Bethlehem
Pentagon Nephilim, sitting in the center of a pentagram
(Hook x2)

[Hook 2x]
A bullet never lies, it always tells the truth
My words are gunshots that influence the youth
Assassinate presidents like John Wilkes Booth
Put the message in the barrel of your gun then *bang*
[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Fuck the Source, fuck XXL, fuck any media machine
Or magazine that front on my team
Word to my comrades in the struggle
Peace to HHC for putting me and Necro on their cover
Your favourite rappers are Non Phixion fans
Your wifey is an Ill Bill groupie with my dick in her hand
United and dead-set, these young hoes wanna fuck me
Excited like rednecks at gun shows in Kentucky
I rock soccer stadiums in Bogota
Saw ten thousand Colombians screaming, "Non Phixion, god."
Don't be confused, this ain't that bullshit you listen to
We that shit that your bitch fingers her pussy to
Pound that Moog organ, chemical warfare, songs for hardcore goons
The rest of y'all scared
It's that radioactive green chronic in the blunt music
Brooklyn homie, run up and pop you with a gun music
Break it down for the blind, the brainwashed
Religions, politicians and thugs pray to the same god
Bloods and Crips, Democrats, Republicans
Red and blue states to represent the sets they're running with
Other gangs play the game too
A blood named George Bush and his team smoked the entire Hussein crew
Classic example of former friends turned to rivals
Words of the bible inspire murder, turn to survival
Die for your set, bang for Muhammad and Jesus
A shitty public school system and a car that's decent
I'm an American, I need a blowjob and a pizza
So I'll overthrow you for oil, Mastercards and Visas
[Hook 2x]
[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
This is a mother fuckin' siege and slaughter, another story of war
A holy vision of the purity and glory before
I warned you before about Leviathan and biochips
And about the second coming of the Messiah shit
About the motherfuckin' mark of the beast
About the CIA distributing the crack in the streets
A savage with beef, leave your body wrapped in a sheet
He from Brooklyn, I'm from Philly, we was trapped in the streets
My rap is complete, with everything from clappers and heat
Pay us homage as you're praying at your enemy's feet
That's why none of y'all can feel the god's real pain
And none of y'all will never know God's real name
Me and Bill is like the lightning and thunder
Like in 1985, Iron Mike and his hunger
A triflin' brother, give me the weed and the 'caine
So I can chop it up in pieces and distribute the pain
I know that that's some ignorant shit to be saying
But if I was you and you was me then you would spit it the same
You viciously maimed, bleeding in a visceral flame
Till your spirit enter in a metaphysical plane

(Chorus)
I turned 21 in prison, doing life without parole
When the jury heard what I'd done, guilty was the vote
When the judge gave me my sentence, he read it to me cold
Whiskey on his breath, 
masturbating underneath his robe
Only 21 in prison, doing life without parole
When I had the chance, I should've sold the devil my soul
Hell yeah, I shot the sheriff, left his body full of holes
Now I'm 21 in prison, doing life without parole
(Verse 1)
We all enter the world the same way
Naked and screaming, soaked in blood but things change
Some are brought home to palaces, others to the projects
Some are born billionaires and some are born convicts
Momma said when life gives you lemons make lemonade
Take a piss in it and serve it to the people that you hate
My pops always said there's only two types my friend
Those with loaded guns and those who eat shit 'til they're dead
I miss both of them, one's gone, the other in prison
I hate both of them, the love dies and none of it given
I gave both of them enough time to show me their wisdom
I'll take both of them to hell with me, my soul is convicted
As I stand in front of Satan hoping for answers
Coping with madness, I hold the chrome like a social advantage
Never hate your enemies, it affects your judgement
Keep it close point blank range and render justice!
(Chorus)
(Verse 2)
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury
The defendant's story begins within a childhood of fear and misery
Age ten, witnessed his father murder his own mother
The guilt of her death lingers in his dreams when he slumbers
Even though he was a child he still felt responsible
Most of his adolescence in and out of mental hospitals
Anti-social, anti-everything
Sucked into a system, pacified by prescribed medicine
With psychiatrists as father figures
His biological a scumbag sociopath locked in prison
He hated him with all his heart and so he never visited
Though the monster that his father was also lived in him
Kill a person you're a murderer, thousands you're a terrorists
Everyone, you're the father of Jesus of Nazareth
Perception is reality, facts are negotiable
I'll clap the Mac off and put twenty-one holes in you
(Chorus)
Coke, it costs money
Planes, they cost money
This yacht, it all costs money
Do you think Kitty's free? (What?!) huh!?
Kitty turn around (What?) turn around
Mister please put the gun down
(gunshot)
Now the next time that a plane goes down
You better be on it

[Verse One: Ill Bill]
Holy shit, they tried to torture me, three officers bleed nauseously
They eating pork and beans and involved in Pagan sorcery
Super vegan, heard your crew is beefing, now goons is creeping
Hebrews blacker than Zulus and guidos rocking wifebeaters
DT’s rocking Fubu up in the ninth precinct
Rusty pipes, no-bar types scheming through life cheating
Seen the pig get shot in the face for the right reasons
Find a way to civilize a trife heathen
The Ill Bill collector suicide king, my sounds are hard drugs
We God’s thug popping off guns, you lost blood
Like you lost your head
Talking to me is like having your fortune read
By a fourth-century sorcerer that tortures men
Then try to walk the subway platform with gats drawn
Like a postal worker coming home drunk and just lost his job
That’s what we dealing with in Roman times
I never liked schools, fucking devils always told me lies
And try to brainwash
But re-evaluate
 everybody fucking hates cops
And if you blasted one you gained props
Hyper shit, Roddy Piper shit, tiger type to sniper shit
Be selling my fly shit for five percent, fuck that
I be on top going for delf
Twelve thousand units then I sold another twelve
I Shot Reagan was the joint that sparked the tight chaos
Like stray shots that spray cops, break up the séance
[Verse Two: Jise One]
Eh yo white thugs is shot watch war minister’s spot
Niggas are clocked up cause the undergound explodes hot
Melting pot, the vandal four angle to stop your free fall
Before you get the sawed-off, welcome to get your timbs sawed
Lyric evangelist, I’ll never turn the cheek
I tore it off your face, it ain’t sweet, sour to hot piece
Speak to hear your half-ass multiplied by two
Goon niggas is anal, through the butt they learn to chew food
Spit it out, you talk shit Q, your rhymes are old too
So you see me split ways
Seven to give to high shroom
Zoom as your lady flashing sideways
Battle you for the saddle 
(i see you)
, lost the rhythm to foreplay
Nasty king interpret, delegate passion swimmer
Sinner to all religious sect, tremor to any bigger
Trigger to mental pistol power, shower your appearance
Clearance shatter the nearest foul play, who wanna feel this?
[Verse Three: Goretex]
This is camp site, take my advice, a game of life
Holy nights like Hanukkah lights amid your gun fights
Tel Aviv with laser sights, pluton shit
Eh yo we move shit
Left-wing cats straight out of goon flicks
So Uncle Howie gave them pigs a chase
We here to fit the states
Glenwood projects made trays into base
Y’all can’t emerge in a safe place
I turn energy into sensory data in high rates
W-H-T, your TV’s and CD’s
LSD flash, kill my landlord for seven G’s
Tangle with my clique, I’ll leave you shackled from your dick
Mexican magic (?) (peyote?) (owe me?) an extra clip
Yo I was bred with a tortured head
Connected with the dead, don’t bother with needles, we conquered then fled
Cashless society awaits us, don’t ever trace us
You caught me, sort of like Kiss without the makeup
[Verse Four: Q-Unique]
Incineration of your whole Generation X
Next context sounded similar to top ten
Must stop when I drop panic and see what I’m thinking
Iceberg your brain state got your mind sinking
Open like the fat beats I’m singing
Consider it illiterate, you can’t read between the lines
I’m ten times the pen rhymes you write on blue lines
Exaggerated existence of commercial sounds
Like pussy politicians got political prisoners locked down
Knock down and hit you with the impact
Of a penny tossed off the observation deck of a skyscraper
I spy my paper like a board or secret cult
The vital data that can shatter government bodies, rock parties
Like a boulder rolling through a nightclub
One might bug
 at the fact that fourteen years
Of rap only got me underground dap
I’m past that like I missed my stop on the A-Train
Here’s the weight gain from the great brain
Pass the spray paint

[Verse 1: ~Vinnie Paz~]
This is Taliban rap, I'm a fucking bomber*
My head wrapped like somebody who suffered trauma
Musically I'm the embodiment of Jeffrey Dahmer
Usually in the environment of marijuana
My straight right like Arguello was
You a medigon,
 
Vinnie do what a dego does
You about to find out what the human tornado does
You a bitch, you ain't even half what you say you was
My shit is hard body lord, I'm a fucking legend
I don't get my hands dirty, that's for fucking henchmen
I'm the equivalent of Russian Roulette, fucking tension
And when you hear the ram's horn it's the fucking ending
I'm a vampire, I love the setting of sun
The night my time killing already begun
I'm from the same place Anton Lavey is from
I'm about to put the biscuit right to my head and be done
[Hook: ~Demoz~]
This Perc 10 got me feeling like a brick wall
With that said I give a fuck about a withdrawal
Fuck a quarterback, bullets get you picked off
Critics get pissed on when I'm pissed off
This Percodan got me feeling like a brick wall
With that said I give a fuck about a withdrawal
Fuck a quarterback, bullets get you picked off
Critics get pissed on when I'm pissed off
[Verse 2: ~Demoz~]
1978 my mom had a date
'84 had me, had a hard time great
Mom wasn't weak, I guess my dad wasn't fake
But guessing only led to one thing, my mistakes
That's why I cut the grass real low, check for snakes
Apply pressure when I need to satisfy my weight
Selling coke and the diesel
Fiends going crazy putting dope in their needles, it's hopeless and evil
You can smoke wet
 
and get smoked with the Eagle
All over nothing, fucking pride and your ego
Spit all facts, I ain't gotta mislead you
Talk shit wherever you stand, that's where I leave you
Believe me, I can get you killed real easy
Leave the scene but the ho won't leave me
Tackle the dresser, bitch try to tease me
I put a hole in her head right where her weave be, believe me
[Repeat Hook:]
[Verse 3: ~I'll Bill~]
I'm the bomb attached to the chest of exploding martyrs, code of honours
Shoot me out your M16, deliver souls beyond the world
To conquer planets and enslave entire populations
Colosseums where Hamas supply the operation
Gladiators battle on the side of sovereign nations
Fathers of confrontation, 
Lamas to pop your face in
Blinded by lies and hatred
, they conjure up abomination
Armies march across the continents honouring Satan
The final countdown, 2012
Jumping out the Black Hawk with the black Eagle by the money belt
I take you from the edges of space to the projects
From the pyramids to Giza to where God sits, we monstrous
I'm conscious homie, I'm wide-awake
I supply the hate, 
La Coka Nostra
The skull and guns,
 I supply the weight
How many bricks you want? Let me see your money first
As a matter of fact I'm taking your money you fucking herb
Fuck outta here, 
Billy Idol
, La Coka Nostradamus

[Verse 1: Apathy]
I'm at the opera sitting up in the balcony
Gun aimed at the valkeyrie
Backstage I dabble in black magic & alchemy
Briefcase of cash, passports with a fake name
Traveling through Russia with bombs on a freight train
Turn popes to cokeheads cause they broke bread with goat heads
Paranoid skitzophrenics with no meds
Weaving through the Vatican traffic on a moped
Carrying machine guns, cops scream code red
Command center computers scramble to find intruders
Police scan the local rooftops for sharp shooters
I'm cold as Siberia
, flow is so superior
The smell of cigars stain Mercedes interior
The black snow, black hole leader like Castro
I'm sitting in a cemetery poisoning black crows
The mass knows nothing of my fiendish plots
They try deciphering the rhymes that this genius drops
I concoct concoctions to make your heartbeat stop
We're locked in a Russian gulag sleeping on old cots
Guards moving like robots patroling the cellblocks
30 below zero, who the hell said Hell's hot?
I swore to my maker I'd never spit a wack flow
Or spend eternity in Hell shoveling black snow
[Hook: Ill Bill]
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed 
black snow
Not after your cash, we are after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
[Verse 2: Sicknature]
The Snowgoons are battering rams through your speaker
Hazardous craft that´ll freeze ya
Earthquaking bangers and them smackers that slap up the sleepers
Landscapes are collapsing when we shatter the sets
We are like the Four Horsemen breathing down the back of your neck
Curtains are met for competition with no further regrets
Have you floating the ocean face down with a bird on your head
I'm leaving rivals flabbergasted, minds can have you backless
That´s why I´ll design my raps to chop heads off like flying battle-axes
Green Mile on beat, killing it, you as relevant as garbage
Stomp through your empire like the elephants of Carthage
Colder than the poles when the notions are woven
Stay in control and always keep one eye open like Odin
When the market is too numb we march to the goon drum
'Till it´s a wrap, leaving you wrapped in a carpet of goosebumps
The storm comes, there´ll be no time for a last phone call
When the dark skies open to let the black snow fall
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Celph Titled]
I got a sinister plot to 
administer shots
Samurais that let hammers fly,
 
ninjas with Glocks
Bust through brick walls, walk through glass
Terminator Titled, let 'em live, why would I do that?
Dumping everything I got at ya
Don't you think it's odd that I run this shit from Antarctica to Ottawa?
Stuff you in a garbage truck,cause you been trash
Wear your hat straight, but I'll put snaps where your brim at
Make you rock a special needs helmet cause you been wack
Uppercut punch, left you bent back
Halfway up your nose was the chin strap
The doctor handed me some notes and this graph
That said this boy need a skin graft
I don't talk to cops so save that report
My interrogation video's a Charlie Chaplin short
So when you hear the gat blow we comin' through the backdoor
I let the brrrat go repping for Black Snow
[Hook]

Imagine you were given one hour
Exactly sixty minutes and zero seconds to put your entire life
And the world around you in total perspective
What would you say? What would it sound like?
[Choir music (By The Waters of Babylon)]
By the waters the waters of Babylon
We lay down and wept and wept for Thee Zion
We remember we remember we remember Thee Zion
[Ill Bill]
We've unraveled the Bible code
, the rifle explodes
Demand attention like a knife in your throat
They're controlling the price of your soul
Titans of stone, 
psychic totalitarian
Biotelemetric mind control experimentation is various
Narcotics made to inflict pain and madness
Assassins with multiple personalities
Active with full access
A backstage pass to cover up spectacular assassinations
And arms deals across the axis
Another witch hunt, religious radicals with big guns
Big plans, invisible cameras built in Japan
CIA behaviour control scientists in the cults
And formed an alliance of cult leaders, also their clients
Tech-savvy hijacker associates bought planes
To practice, anxiously awaiting their global audience
Enter the core, I feel this with ease
The ultimate reality series, loaded with cameras, angles, and theories
Now hear me
[Hook]
A golden helmet blinded minds
Among ten thousand swords
Along the road to Babylon
A golden thunder silenced songs
Among ten thousand voices
On the road to Babylon
[Ill Bill]
This operation doesn't exist
The revolution will be classified
Live broadcast from the abyss
Our cities are crack spots and cardboard condominiums
Vicious and trackmarks cross minds lost in delirium
The towers dropped, blind fools, confusion who knew?
Now the world watch Saddam's execution on Youtube
Propaganda machines wage media
 
Jihad
A teen walking to a crowded movie theatre with bombs
Reading the Qur'an
, silently obedient to God
Known by many different names: 
Hashem, Jesus, and Allah
Exploding porn, 
shadow government protocols
Go to war amongst ten thousand voices on the road to Babylon
Patriot Act
, sanctioned exorcism
Iranian and North Korean-built weapon systems
Budgets increase to payroll hundreds of creeps
Number of the beast
, bomb London under the streets
The engineer was a popular peer
His value appeared to having nuclear weapons just shower the air
A thin line between power and fear
A martyr in tears, goodbye father
Now my final hour is here, help me
[Hook]

[Intro]
Ill Bill
Apathy
Brooklyn goons to Snowgoons
Demigodz, LCN
Doe rakers
[Hook] -- Apathy
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
Watch out where them Snowgoons go
We make the sky bleed black snow
Not after your cash, we're after your soul
We make the sky bleed black snow
[Verse 1] -- Ill Bill
I'm a diamond in the rough
Leave hollows in the gun
Leave large holes in your skull
Cause you ain't never coming home
You'll never fucking survive
I'm leaving nothing alive
Nobody's gonna escape
Everybody's gonna die
Like the angel of death
Creep up with the four-fives
And chrome nines
No love lost and no smile
No mercy, no retreat
No surrender, coke and heroin
I'm the man on the street
Like a old school metalhead
Riding dirty, mind perverted
Shooting pornos behind the iron curtain
Do more dirt than Tide detergent
Fuck peace, I'm a violent person
My mind's a distorted and fucked-up pile of wires and circuits
Uncle Howie Records
 
there be drugs around me forever
A foundation of terror that rise together
Buck off dimes and motherfuck dames together
We fight til the motherfucking death and die together, 
La Coka
Chorus
[Verse 2] -- Apathy
Motherfucker I'm Zeus
In a bubble goose with Timberland boots
They try to hang me with a noose
I rip the tree from its roots
You in cahoots with Lhus
Suffer if you got a den of some hating troops
I got a blender full of 
forbidden fruits
The force of my flows could fracture forty bottles
Got a posse of apostles
 and pussy from supermodels
I'm a monster in mosh pits, powerful as Pac spits
Launching rockets from Glock clips and my six
The Mossberg moss and that kill sound clash
Only fuck thick chicks with a big round ass
Outlast motherfuckers, I'll be taking out trash
Need to get up, get out, just listen to Outkast
Ap's flows
 smack foes, jack dough, 
mack hoes
Spitting rhymes, making dictators resign like Castro
The heavy ammunition is the weapons of choice
Run up on these motherfuckers like, "Sprechen sie Deutsch?"
Chorus

[Ill Bill]
There's a fixed rate of pay per murder & the assassin
Is a expert so you know that he stay with the burner
From buying Glocks to 
LSD psych ops
Amen Ra Masonic Lodge
To the private blog of Adam Weishaupt
Public enemy caught in the shooter's lobby
The real life Luca Brasi,
 so fuck you and the Illuminazi
Spray with the milf
The cradle of filth
A.38, some cocaine and some pills, stay chill
Supergroupies wanna get raped & scraped in the grill
Duct taped & filmed, I cut to the chase & I drill
This that murderworld animal funk, a brand you can trust
Like Phil Knight, listen how it bang in the trunk
[Hook]x2
The darkness that surround us can't hurt us
It's the darkness in the heart of our souls
That turn us into murderers
Even though we gutter
We still gotta reach for the stars
Peace to the gods
Now speak to the kronze
[Ill Bill]
They say that doomsday was written in an alien bible
In algebraic code
Signalling a day of reprisal
Now pay the toll
Homemade weapons, razors crazy glued to toothbrushes
Two suspects, no arrests, Koolaid smiles & hold grudges
Excited deathsquads, Knights of Templar
The lightest kevlar, the finest champagne, write your memoirs
They tried to extradite him for running guns
So he faked his own death & had plastic surgery in Colombia
The last of the cast iron, blast fire, anti
Accidental billionaire amongst the vampires
Protest is not disturbing the peace
There's no peace
It's disturbing the war, murder galore, secret police
Plain clothes, F.B.I. earpiece
Work the crowd with sunglasses on
Beach hat, banana clip at the bar
The AK under the dinner table
We innovative
So we'll survive after everything else has disintegrated
[Hook]x2

[Q-Unique]
Witnessin the sinister, spittin on your minister
Splittin up your skin, clip and trigger will diminish ya
Torch the competitor, score and get ahead of ya
Work a drone 
alien at war with the Predator
Boba Fett bounty hunter
, 
best King's County gunner
Q they go to trial when you found dead down and under
Hear the sound of Thunder, enter the God Thor
Standing with the hammer killer, what you think you shot for?
You tried to cut the line, you tried to fuck with mine
"Criminal Minded" third track, killer buckin nines
You wanna sleep stupid? Go ahead, hit the hay
When I pop shots, watch bullets ricochet
Reputed mob boss make the drop off
Enemies are shakin when they heard a shotty pop off
+
Night of the Living Dead
+, kill 'em in the morn
I'm on an "Award Tour" with the +
Children of the Corn
+
[Hook 2X: Q-Unique]
We Crillionaires, won't stop till we millionaires
Popping off Mac milli shells fill the air
Leaving you see through, bullet through your people
When we creep through we street sweeper Grim Reap' you
[Ill Bill]
I come from a world where things are not always what they seem
Use symbols to connect into your dreams, and nightmares
Thieves of the night scale skyscrapers and dive out of windows
Like characters from Hollywood films...
This ain't no movie script, it's excitingly real
Nuclear devices the size of a pill
Lightning in a test tube, write me the bill
Black budgets, hundreds of billions of dollars in funding
Private gunmen hunted by governments, I'm havin fun with it
But hardly sleep, aim my RPG, spark your D
Pop the Marines, the steel was given to me by the Elohim
I rock your motherfuckin block into smithereens
Sell you pistols cheap, take the bread and flip 'em into ki's
Then flip it back to bread, bubble like Actifed
You can buy yourself a small army if you act correct
You could catch a bullet in your brain at the red
You could overthrow the free world while you laugh at death
[Hook]
[Slaine]
You should know who we are, throw a motherfucker from a movin car
Tell em I'm a movie star run into a groupie's bra
Rip the sample off man, fuck what kind of rules there are
Rip the sample off the song, beat you with the blues guitar
Frequent in the nudie bar, live inside the drug den
Told me I'm a has-been, that's just what I was then
I'm a fucking will-be, I'm innocent
I'm takin what I want until they kill me, or they find me guilty
I'm filthy, in this dirty business full of sunken labels
Half these cats are products of cash and drunken fables
'til they come across the cats that'll leave you with the punctured navel
Cut the fuck up like a plucked tomato, gun to the cradle
Bumpin somethin, I got you pumpin something fatal
'til you wake up in a trunk with jumper cables
'til you wake up and you're surrounded by angels
[Hook]
[Slaine]
Q-Unique, Ill Bill, Slaine in this motherfucker
Crillionaires~!

[Ill Bill]
You like to take drugs and hear music, my album is engineered
Like biotechnology, attach me to ya ear
I make the devil do the work of God and God do evil
I'm both positive and negative, I'm like two people
Both from New York, New York, so trife they named it twice
Only idiots is broke, the hood is paved with ice
Paved with gold but never let it rape ya soul
Turn the tables on the dough homie take control
Fuck not eatin' shot the sheriff, made 'em stop breathin'
Anybody that ever fucked with me I got even
Wanna be here hardcore homie but you not leavin'
Starin' down at yourself prayin' maybe you'll stop bleedin'
God hates us all,
 use your brain to decorate the wall
Put a bullet in ya dome, desecrate ya skull
A world of pain so hot, Bill burst into flames
Psychological, spit it like a person deranged
[Necro]
I'm one of Brooklyn's best sickos, I'm not egotistical
Just statin' facts hollow tip bullets keep the biscuit full
My rap speaks for itself, it's alive
It says fuck with me and I'll have to murder you to survive
There ain't many like me not too many like me
Too many wanna be like me it's not likely
Ya packin' a sword and a bat
But me I'm runnin' across the chessboard with a gat, 
aimed at ya queen
I don't gotta play this game clean
But I'm a play it like I mean business and I'm a utilize my brain to scheme
Rap been producin' directin' pimpin' an evil thinkin' clappin'
It's gruesome dissections
I started rhymin' in 88 like eighth grade in New York state
The only emotion I displayed was hate
For pigs with gats and kids that rat
Fuck a snitch, you can't blame me for an animal like that
[Q-Unique]
I clash with the mind of a machetero
And laugh if you cryin' when I blast the metal
March with an army of darkness until ya shotty go shot less
With a cock that'll make ya mommy drop topless
Write a bible quote with his blood on the wall
Another horror flick victim is just, runnin' to fall
Now the FBI say that theirs a nut on the crawl
It's Q the fuckin' maniac, brought a gun to the brawl
Pop the tow truck cop from my automobile
Then slide up in the club and party with my portable steel
Violence for the violent consumer, keep ya ear to the beat
Ya eyes glued to the luger and true to the herd
Hopin' to hurt ya fancy life
Cuz I paid taxes and vote for the anti Christ
Unholy trinity, vacate the whole vicinity
Scrappin' dignity and quickly take the hoes virginity
[Gortex]
Gore’s back, the fourth Zodiac, sharpshooter, top of the pack
I keep it poppin' like I'm thrown in Iraq
Y'all know the cults back, the most hated with the sickest flow
Control freak handin' out cups like I was Jim Jones
Bury the rubble, half y'all live in the bubble
Fakin' my own death to forge passports and body doubles
Flash to 86, bubble coats toast and sneakers
Slay ya wrists, 
keep the posse thick, ropes and beepers
Dead celebrities, real life ain't as dope as the movies
Mental funeral the trauma unit since it was juvis
Out the hood groupies, coke head thugs and rock cuties
Motley Crue sluts love to chew cock and cop boobies
Swing the war hammer, see me on tour flyin' the Gor banner
The pigs tryin' to catch me out shoppin' I'm so modest
The gods are metal so consider the dream
Elvis is dead and 
2Pac, he livin' in Queens

[Raekwon]
Oh shit~! It's on huh?

Fuck around, try to run around, you greasy
Don't even dare - put your cell phone down dear
Before I put my gun in your ear
I'm not a new jack, an Iker or a jerk with a pump
I'm straight sober, I'mma feed my ratchet and hunt
We kill Willies, still hillbillies don't call us nuttin else

You old man, sit down - tie up his hands
And yo smack flames out him, get more and then blamp him
[Interlude]
Don't move! Don't fuckin move!
Put your hands in the air, put your hands in the air
Get 'em up!! Get on your knees
Get on your knees, GET ON YOUR KNEES
Gimme that fuckin bag man
Gimme that shit you're my fuckin wife man
Get the fuck out
[Ill Bill]
This bitch started blowin me in the safe
Her fantasy to fuck a bank robber so I blew a load in her face
I knew her from 
Canarsie
, used to work at 
Chase Manhattan
Smiled when I walked in wavin the 
ratchet
An inside job, the best kind, the rest I rob
Stay on the ground or you'll be laid to rest by God
I seen big face hundreds and bearer's bonds
I also see cameras on, I'm glad I wore my ski mask camouflage
Listen to 
"Lamb of God"
 while I packed the 
bong
While I studied how to disable a bank alarm
We got three minutes, handle the job; I'm standin on top
Of the counter with the 
chopper
 barrel starin at y'all
Why you pussies bleedin all on my money you fuckin up my hundreds
Don't get your fuckin head kicked on some dumb shit stupid
We the future of this bank robbin industry
Kidnap the judge and get a hundred years conspiracy
[Outro]
Everybody in the vault, get out, move!
{*screaming*} On the floor, now, NOW, do it, do it
On the floor, now, NOW!
Let's play a game Mr. President

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Never doubt your God, children singing songs about 
Jihad
Explosions that blow cars over buildings from afar
We the children of a bloodstained revolution
Gun bang, 
forever shoot and run
 fam, get your 
Uzi
 love thing
Retribution
 
Timberland boots
, leather gooses
In the undisclosed black bulletproof with the extra shooter
Bought a 
box of banana clips
 from these anarchists
Like 
Tim Osman
 
commanding the ship on dialysis
More pain more gain, 
9/11 was a war game
More enemies, more friends, more fame
Listen to propaganda 
cock the hammer
We can stop a man but how do you destroy an army that’s a phantom?
How do you kill a militia that’s invisible?
Mystical, peep what official pistols do, kid we invincible
How do you stop the unstoppable, unkillable?
The salvation of God, now sit back and listen to the song y’all
[Verse 2: Vinnie Paz]
I heard children sing 
Allahu Akhbar
 in 
Turkey
One had a 
Russian AK
, dirty 
Iverson jersey
I don’t know if it made me proud or if it disturbed me
I guess it’s not as bad as kids being fucked by the clergy
Kufi
 on, 
Glock cocked
 moving through the palace
A dead Kennedy in California Über Alles
I’ll drink a quart of virgin blood inside a 
Buddha chalice
I took the head off a Kennedy from the roof in Dallas
Yeah I wish that Ron Paul ran again
If not then I’mma have to take the lead like 
Jeff Hanneman
(
Seasons of the abyss
) y’all falling for the trap again
.38 leave your fucking body like a mannequin
Yeah if 
Billy
 blast at you I blast with him
We don’t live in a republic, it’s just fascism
The Louvre isn’t a museum, it’s a glass prison
Fuck a 
class system
, listen to the song y’all

[Verse 1: Slaine]
Yeah, yeah, check it out
Antidepressants and anti vibe nose candy tan yon high
Red huffy bike propping nanny on the handle bars
I push the dukes of hazard big wheeled, pulled the brake
Chase the ice cream truck down the street
Full mistake
Caught a cramp fat boy style since a young-in
Ketchup stains on my shirt look what I’m becoming
Reagan got shot, Bush became president later
Clinton got his dick sucked, Ken style was a hater
About your pose voice drop
Yeah, got an oct to blow
Luger ?
My socks when i rocked them yo
[plaguer ribbed sugar raiser ? hotdog]
The fix is in
The best cars are made right in Michigan
Listening to Beastie Boys on cassette deck from a boom box
Pedophile rumors from the king with the moonwalk
Moms calling out my name I ain’t in for dinner yet
TVs with antennas that was way before the internet
[Hook x2]
Look at the news on the TV as the world turns
I saw the world change and the World Trade burn
I don’t believe in hardly any thing but evolution
They should have killed us all the children of the revolution
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Yo, guidos rocking peoples hairdos and speedos
While scarface 
scooters saw I had
 to move was a kilo
We went from rocking Michael Jackson 
and the all notes
To rocking 8balls jackets and 8balls of coke
Seen the 80s when the dukie truck 
james was called roakes
?
All of he’s clothes
Reaganomics was popping
So was ?
In 87’ 88’ half of my projects was locked up
Same time as 
I ran contra in my ally nor
Dreams of Def Jam profile, tommy boy
[ralph the daniel’s?]
 in the afternoon passed the shrooms
Light the weed catch me in the apartment 2c
Playing Break Street on my Commodore 64
Listening to break beats. Mr. Magic and Marley Marl
Either that or a new 68
The world turns while the revolution's viewed with a shifty face
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3: Slaine]
People man DJing in a park with the lethal hands
Puerto rican man
Jamaican playing with puerico grands
?
Child with a birth mark on he’s head the wars off
Slayer and Metallica besides that his sword is soft
Met a wise public enemy
The voice of the ghetto vizor
Evolution of a revolution is televised
Bin laden in the CIA now they telling lies
That's goodbye
King in South America and selling pies
[Verse 4: Ill Bill]
The devils rise as another empire falls
The enterprise allies on weaponized fire balls
At first claiming a high cause
As soon central lies intelligence reveal their bottom plans on then I ain't yours
We went from innocence to cynicism
From heavy metal lyricists to hip pop lyricism
From animation to live action suspended animation the sleepers cells
To Manchurian assassins
[Hook x2]

[Verse 1: Necro]
I'm like a dead corpse crawling out the dirt, on some zombie shit
Aiming for your neck to bite the flesh where the veins connect
My brains incorrect, traumatize you in a sec
My rap are like crack in a deck, Satanic intellect
Slaughters you, I got more for you
Gore for you, your flesh is sort of blue
You'll be begging someone to pull me off of you
When I'm stabbing you, I offered you a chance to leave
You'll only understand when you bleed, there's no talking to you
Just shoving a fork in you, who the fuck you talking to?
Im pure death in a flesh, I'll arrange a coffin for you
My knife packing status, got you shook
A lot of crooks respect my rep, step, kid I advise you not to look
Turn your head, or you'll turn up dead
Put you asleep inside a burning bed, learn from what I said
I'm mushing your peeps, and I'm squishing you deep
Beneath, where the deceased rest in peace
[Verse 2: Mr Hyde]
I.. injure you with ninja crews, Contemplate what sin to do
Negotiate with Satan, cause it's his decision too
Hold a sword like ghost [?], leaving blood and gross gore
So disgusting that your corpse is not allowed in most morgues
So jagged and decrepit kid, that the maggots rejected it
I dumped it in the sea and killed all life except for squid
Walk the wrong path, deviated by demons
While you faggot mother fuckers were created by semen
Lure you into my web, change your corduroys to red
Then look for you to find you in the mortuary dead
Fill my clip with the leather put the biscuit to the head
After I ripped you up to shreds I'll take a sip of what you bled
Don't ever try and hawk [?] cause I don't wanna talk
Ill play the kind of sport the way you catch a tommahawk
Open up your skull, fabrics falling to the ground
Take a toke and sniff a pull like your drawn to the sound
[Verse 3: Goretex]
Thugs cry blood, supported by the hemp and the guns
Y'all tempt me to flip, so morbid when I empty the clip
It's awful how we decorate your coffin, send me the clit
We celebrate when enemy blood shakes, now render me sick
Whatever ya fix, get fitted with a milli a chrome
Rap Vinnie Jones,
 I disattach, snatch from the bone
And ate the last witnesses k-ed out on medicine
Health nut, crush up my wheat germ, chase it with heroin
Guerilla biscuits, busting your windpipes into splinters
Another thing that causes pain is the frost in the winter
Circle of tyrants, rocking the verdict crossed iced-out
Blood from em, two in your face, get erased, lights out
Spikes out for dish rags, keep em on the hip like shit bags
You don't want it fag? Be left in the bubble, covered [?] the fam
State bent, like breathing rubber, so be advised
Lucifer's rising the invocation of my demon brother
[Verse 4: Ill Bill]
Splattered in blood, rather my thoughts paddles in drugs
Morbid visions of cadavered ravaged by maggots and bugs
Beetles crawling out of your eyes sockets
Puss pouring out of your mouth on top of dry vomit
Billions of body bags, blood drenched battle fields
Big butcher knives, you fucking faggits
Get your fucking face erased from your cabbage
Tangled and gored on top, half of you're body hanging off the door
Spasm and splash your organs across the floor
Its death.. the slug hit the bullet proof vest
I took from the policeman after I blew off his head
We knights of Satan serving Satan's aiders
God is an atheist, you fucking idiots, your bitches give brain to us
Save yourself, the altar of sacrifice
We criminally insane, escape form Bellevue
Sniffing up cocaine don't even try it
It's Ill Bill, the gourmet of violence
Donate my brain to science, vacation in insane asylums
[Verse 5: Captain Carnage]
Come on come all to my carnival of carnage
Where I'll.. slice and dice and peal off your shell like an orange
I'm too precise not to be nice
I know you like Christ you'll pay twice the price
I'll put brains on ice
For preparation prepare for the separation
Of your foundation so come get your 
found basted
In hot sauce I roasted like hot dogs on an open fire I'm a 
trig like Myer
But don't anile the entire picture, because I hang you like fixture so when you enter the mixture
Use extreme caution, because it only takes one portion
To perform an abortion with the steel that I force in
You feel lost when you get tossed in the bottomless gorge
The heroin horde got guns and swords swords swords swords

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yeah, sniff your brains out all my Al Capone, Al Pacino nigga's
For real nigga
Sniff your brains out all my Al Capone, Al Pacino nigga's
For them gangsters
Sniff your brains out all my Al Capone, Al Pacino nigga's
Yeah, let's get it, Yo, hey yo Bill represent nigga what up, what up
[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
An eight ball of coke will make 
Sara smile like Hall & Oates
Line it up, 
spread it on the table like Torah scrolls, homie
But if you Len Bias, you're a goner
Now put the money in the bag before me and Rae pull an Osama
Square biz, no plots or schemes boy
Hit you with 50 shots like them cops from Queens
You're on a cross with a crown that bleeds
Resurrect you with a speed bump and trumpets that sound like screams
Shoot the bitch in the trunk of the Buick for foolishness
Killed for losing bricks, this is 
Only Built For Cuban Linx
Lord know I got mouths to feed
So my heart is ice cold to anybody outside my team
Fuck you, pay me a million dollars, matter fact, make it a billion
Fuck a condo I'm taking the building
Posted like the 
Freeway Ricky Ross
 in the Porsche
And hosted by Manowar's Ross the Boss at L'amours
[Hook: Ill Bill]
Sniff your brains out all my 
Vinny the Chins and Joe Pescis
With coke recipes and hoes on ecstasy, 
La Coka Nostra a brand you can trust
Catch me in the bathroom stall handing out bumps
[Verse 2: Raekwon]
We blast shottys off the roof, strapped, trapped in a coup
Living like this, duke'll have a nigga bidding in boots
I swear to my seeds, daddy gonna buy you the V's
But instead I got trapped and started buying them keys
I went from rich kid, selling under the bench to lynch kid
High power money nigga living in Richmond
Wore a few beefs, ran through hoods, ordered new jeeps
Pull guns on police, shot up the 
four seasons
Then I got clapped, yapped, thought I had it right
But I was wrong then, now I get it on when I write
I rectify this, you live by the sword and get fried by the board
Cause that's the only way we got to get on
What it is nigga, get high, remember the grizz
And play the tape that resemble the great, that's Raekwiz, nigga
Stay real, history's ill, don't stop til you cash in
Catch me in the Aston with Bill Pill
[Hook]

Glory fades and glory days ain’t always what they seem
Give all I got and make my salaat and dream my broken dreams
I crawl inside, ball up and hide, tuck my pain away
And hope to God I fall into a sleep where I can stay
We all got bills to settle, we all got a price to pay
And if I make it through the night I can fight another day
They say it’s better to burn out than it is to fade away
I just hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay
[Verse 1: 
Slaine
]
It was a couple of years ago that I started becoming numb
No one could understand where all my words were coming from
Having visions of a nine-to-five, a wife, a blunt, a son
Of a life of hustle getting by with some of the running gun
Is it best to be a crumb? My ex says he’s a bum
Lashing out in violence whenever my destiny it hung
In the balance, rum, I’m drinking gallons, some think that my flows
Are more poetic than the poems of 
Edgar Allen Poe
But I know that I’m at a challenge though
I can hold an old 
Calico
 to my dome and let my talents go
Shit, I spent my whole life around the violence so
I planted seeds of hate oh I let my habits grow
I slept with the homeless, I copped with the fiends
Lost the love inside my heart, I even forgot what it means
Seen the ripest nights turn into the rottenest schemes
But through it all I have never forgotten my dreams
[Hook 2: Everlast]
When the gutters fill with blood that’s spilled from friends that pass away
And memories of eulogies while standing by their graves
Just trying to survive we wind up living lives like slaves
I hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay
We all got beef to settle, we all got demons to slay
And if I pray all through the night I can fight another day
They say it’s better to burn out than it is to fade away
I just hope to God I can fall into a sleep where I can stay
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Rest in peace to my homie Sob
I stand before an altar of open sepultures and coffins
I heard Javier got killed, it didn’t seem real
With an army of goons drinking straight vodka to deal
We live and die by the gun, wear our hearts on our sleeves
Even though our compassion’s destined to die on the streets
What’s left over a cold hollow murder machine
With an appetite for malevolence, perversion, and greed
When one of us dies we don’t really learn anything
Outside the funeral doing bumps, burning trees
Plotting revenge, crying over fallen angels
Sometimes your friends die the most awkward strangers
I can’t lie, sometimes this life makes me a stranger to myself
But I’m pulling myself together, it’s bigger than just me
As I spit this bear witness to truth
My unborn seed listens while I spit in the booth
[Hook 1]

(Verse One)
The cult leader, the war-monger, armed with four high-powered
Firearm barometers; 
I visited Andromeda
The human cloner, the donate to my fam organ donor
The morbid odor of corpses lowered, the coroner
The cult leader, result needer, the skull and bones bleeder
The chrome heater, the soul eater, the tome reader
The cloak and dagger magnum packer;
Convert star systems to active vacuums
The illest shit since Manson had goons
The great communicator; alien tomb raider
Consume data - 
cut from the same cloth that produced Vader
The cult leader, 
the ultimate fighting champion
The benificient, the lamb, the messiah, the religion
There's a thousand faces, more than the 
cross and the Star of David
I'm the combination of God and Satan
The humble shepherd, the son of lepers, the stuff of legends
The cult leader, I've indulged in the most disgusting of pleasures
Likeable and charismatic; my smilin face has been
Enough to make a mother leave her children in a violent place
I turn knees to noodles; I make my female followers
Want me until they pussy's drippin like fruit juice
The pervert, the pathological, the prophet
I'm the second coming, the Anti-Christ, the final conflict
Who got nuclear weapons and a suicidal doctrine?
The cult leader, and I'll never stop until I got you locked in
(Chorus)
Cult leader! "And everywhere, his words are greated with enthusiasm."
Cult leader! "His listeners have found a personal revelation in what he has to say."
Cult leader! "You will obey your instincts, and try to dominate others."
I'm the motherfuckin cult leader! "Such power transforms, elevates; even purifies.."
(Verse Two)
The life taker, 
followers fly planes into skyscrapers
Send you a disease through the mail wrapped inside paper
The gospel preacher, the hostile teacher
The face of God with an impostor's features
This is the prophecy - the cult leader
The people's temple, the holy ground, the war compound
Four-pound to rifles, disciples, the holy idles
Supreme truth, the cult leader with the green tooth
The multi-millionaire with a stare that can freeze troops
I program people to kill
The motiviational speaker, my words cause people to feel
It's mind control, let the cult leader guide your soul
Open up your eyes to the lies he told
The general, the chief, I be the political pioneer
The cult leader, you can believe in me, I am here
Bless the children, take you under my wing, shelter
Helter Skelter
, this is it, you can't kill me I'll exist forever
(Chorus)
Cult leader! "The leader - a champion of the underdog."
Cult leader! "He tried to show the path of truth, to amaze all mankind."
Cult leader! "Scorned.. ridiculed.. and condemned.."
I'm the motherfuckin cult leader! "Words are inadequate..
.. to convey the majesty, of the" - Cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*} I'm the cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*} Cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*} I'm the motherfuckin cult leader!
{*"The leader" scratched repeatedly*}

[Verse 1: Mad Child]
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time to hear my sentiments
I'm hotter than a kettle and my pen's full of adrenaline
I stopped takin' that medicine, the dust is finally settlin'
Practice close to perfect, nobody is rhyming better than
Mad Child, spewing a monstrosity of anguish
Countrymen are tryin', but they're not talkin' my language
I rap to cover up the pain just like a fuckin' bandage
Emotions like the layers on a sandwich, I peel 'em like a mandarin
These young punks, I'm schoolin' em like Cambridge
Slap these appetizers, I'm the motherfuckin' main dish
First they're on my mind, but then they're fallin' off like dandruff
Now they call me 'White Devil' like Colonel Sanders
Shit, I'm the fire on both ends of a burnin' candle
I'll retire when Jesus come back in a cloak and dirty sandals
Even then, still be rappin' up in heaven beside the manger
Other rappers are in danger, I'm the motherfuckin' misguided angel
[Verse 2: Prevail]
MP4, REV, I make the files wave
Classic tales of revenge, my friend, I will spit on your grave
Kids they got no styles today, gray and white and red and black
When I attack I send 'em back without their fuckin' head intact
Think about that, that's a risk, battle axes, bats and fists
Wilson Fisk, rapping kingpin,
 fastest engine, three man blitz
The pits and pendulums of life are barriers to break through
So barricade yourself inside your house before I take you
Welcome to Lakeview, it's a great view from the padded cell
Cannibal crush, we will prevail and the misguided angel's bad as hell
Like the bat out of hell on a motorbike
With a spike on the helmet on the road to life
Give 'em the light, little parasites, Pacific Rim, got 'em in my sights
Caught in the crosshairs, you're gonna take a loss here
There's lots of air but you can't breathe and see it, can't believe it
Your eyes are playin' tricks, amazing that you still exist
You think you're Superman? Then say my name backwards like Mxyzptlk
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
I spit the fire maniacal vile, we’re wire proof
Die with your boots on and a gun in your hand, I approve
My uncle would too, motherfuck you
Motherfucker, motherfuck everybody in your crew
Or anybody who not ridin' with us to the fullest extent
Put you under cement in the jungle with debt
Smiles of murder and laughs of pain
When we were kids we'd act insane, now we grown considerate the rain
Brooklyn, New York, they say we sound like crooks when we talk
And they probably right, you probably get yourself juxed with a fork
If you steppin' correct, though, everything is 
copasetic
But most these rap though guys is so pathetic
We don't start nothin' but yo, we always down to finish it
Humble to the rumble
 cause we handle our business, kid
Nothin' to brag about, we just built like that
Simmer down, homie, you could get killed like that
[Verse 4: Slaine]
Hold up, hold up, police are on my dick, they don't harass me
Bitches on my dick so if I'm married they don't ask me
I explode, she swallow my load, she take a taxi
Don't forget your cellphone and fix your make-up, Ashley
I’m laughing watchin' you split, talkin' your shit
Whisper underneath your breath leopard Dungarees and mesh shit
My comrades are conniving, 
???
My bad habits are violent I need a padded asylum
(I'm too far gone) Thinking of departuring
My pride paid for what my ignorance was costin' me
The rep got bigger figured everyone was watching me
They looked at me, the underdog, I took this shit impossibly
Throw the fucking bottle back and toss a molotov on me
Holler back, I played this job for keeps and made a boss of me
I reek of charisma can't get it off me
I serenade the whole world and sing it off-key
[Verse 5: Vinnie Paz]
You see the guns is large, 
the bullets hotter than suns and stars
Y'all are pussy like love songs
, it's from the 
DeBarge
When my father died he put his fuckin' son in charge
And he was a G so that made me the son of God
And that mean nobody in my family is gonna starve
That mean nobody can trap me, have me under bars
Boxcutter Paz leave you with a hundred scars
Cops on the ave, 
evil as a hundred tzars
I'm a hypocrite, sendin' mixed messages
The hardest motherfucker you ever contended with
Harder than servin' 20 back-to-back sentences
As an apprentice to a life with no aggressiveness
They just make you a dead body on the precipice
Watch heavier than six necklaces
Rhyme sound effortless, even though the dialogue treacherous
Keep the hammer in the boot, behold the rhyme specialist

[Ill Bill]
I've seen the seven-headed dragon talking to the eagle
The two-headed snake illustrates a caution to the people
Electronic fog, alien bibles, 
crop circles
 at the sand in Cairo
Like Kiss in '76 demanding pyro
Human history, 50% catastrophe
It's actually the arms race between the facts of anarchy
The secret to success is believing that you succeeded
Is more than an achievement;
It's as important as you breathing
Sometimes it's one and the same
, 
who's running the game?
All we ever say is "they", they know it's fun to complain
This shit should cause people to riot and flip
The way I think; I've been classified as violent and sick
I'm like a time bomb, the CIA designed me to tick;
Designed me to head over to papi to buy me a brick
These mother ships hit our radars in the skies as a blip
The entire sky is eclipsed just like the size of my dick
[Hook x 2]
Are these the doomsday chronicles the Bible quotes?
Or is this similar to shock that suicide provokes?
We're all slaves at the auction where our lives are sold
Time to free our minds from the shackles and the lies of old
[Ill Bill]
I leave the face of your society with buck fifty scars
Sour Diesel spliffs from weed jars and flip police cars
Put holes the size of grapefruits through riot gear
Bloody footprints from Jordan 4's on your floor, we pioneers
Take fools to higher tiers, elevate to a higher learning
To a talking bush on the mountain with fires burning
Commandments are carved in stone
Where lightning bolts the thrown in anger, meant to spark the dome
Now frightening results unfold
Dragons, eagles, snakes, and aliens captured;
We keep 'em caged in various constellations and areas
Coded through letters, numbers, and symbols that transmit
Pulses and whistles and activate hundreds of missiles
Hundreds of killers with multiple pistols
While these name brands reverse engineer spacecrafts and make trillions
They made the cure for AIDS and ceased production
While the poor die and fester in diseased corruption
[Hook 2x]

[Necro]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Tonight, we present torture and sodomy
Hosted by Necrophiliac and ILL Cannibill
Relax and smoke some 
crills
I'll make your eyeballs go back in your skull and come out your ass
I'mwalking on hot coal and glass, I shit on the churches mass
Sacroligous, I'll sever your body something prestigious
Precise cuts, I'm fascinated with women's guts
I hit your skins, and I'm jerking off on your intestines
I fuck you in your ass bitch, now your colon is swollen
When I go bowling', to achieve a strike
I use the headpiece of a dyke, I swing her brains down the lane
I'mma sadomasochist, one finger
Two fingers, three fingers, four fingers
FUCK IT THE WHOLE FIST
Up your asshole, 
now you're ready for Ed Powers
And Rocco Siffredi, so suck my cock ho
[Ill Bill]
I be gettin' backrubs in backrooms of S&M clubs
I'm on drugs, during sex I use anal beads and butt plugs
I'm holdin' bitches dooty holes hostage
It's just the sphincter keeps me wondering the winter cause my cock's big
It get's stuck, bitches be getting fucked up they asshole
Open ya oven, so I can cook the dooty casserole
That's how I'm livin' - givin' bitches the shits
I fuck 'em between they tits then I bust a nut on they lips
I vaccinate sockets with lip bloods, like if I was to flip once
I snag a body bag them dirty hags and cuts
Shooting chemicals directly into my jugular - look around
Shits getting uglier and ugliest
Spinnin' within my hyper-barrack chamber
Nothing short of a bloody rusty razor finger brick that could stop my behavior
Generally, and federally
Etcetera, etcetera, including Storm Troopers lie deadera
I emphasize like emphysema
Every word I speak creeps up in your bloodstream like Leukemia
I instigate mutilation
Under federal investigation escaping police stations
[Necro]
Yah I got dead bodies covered with hay in my barn
Loud motherfuckers get there lips sown with yarn
Out the ten story window, head first I chuck you
Attach a switchblade to my dick, and then I FUCK YOU (Fuck you!)
In and out, as I cut the uterus
You'll soon be, familiar with torture if you're new to this
Leave you glued to a piss stained wall
Take my brain out my skull and watch my fuckin' brain crawl
Cause it's alive, it's MOTHERFUCKIN' ALIVE!
Bend over and get sodomized with the four-five
Bumpin' to the beehop, and get stunged
I got the noose of death, so nigga come and get hung
Willingly, your rectum gets bruised, I come from
The world where niggas get fuckin' abused
The realm of violent crime
Where bitches get fucked in the pussy and ass at the same time
[Hook]
Eat shit and die
Eat shit and die
Eat shit and die
Eat shit and die
Eat shit and die
Eat shit and die
Eat shit and die
Eat shit and die
[Ill Bill]
I'm... coming out from inside the walls like Asbestos
A ghost disappearing and reappearing when least most expected
I yank kids on there own bloods when the monster
I'mma monster, responsible for missing camp counselors
I'm analyzing bio-rhythms, sleeping my victims with incisions
My sensory's sees catastrophic visions
Over the image of Jehovah I burn sulfer
In retrospect I infect your innards just like an ulcer
Then twist facial be just like Rocky Dennis,
 when I menace
It's horrendous, my bloody appetite's tremendous
Enormous, watch the metamorphosis, stickin' snitches through orifices
Remorse is not my thoughts, when I catch a corpse
The torture tactics I practice tear up your mattress, kidnap an actress
Then activate my raiding plastics
[Necro]
When they made me, I was so, evil I broke the mold
Necro was cold, my fuckin' birth should of been controlled
If you're bold, you'll get strangled with your gold
No but once, no but TWICE!
Another fucking white slave soul
From whacking off I have a compulsive dependency, plus a tendency
For ruining your bitches pregnancy
Niggas can't understand my morbid biology
I bring new, meaning to the studies of gynecology
When I shove, razors up your cunt you'll see
All bitches that diss me wind up with fucking V.D
When I was in my mom's cunt, my father slaughtered me
I came back, from the dead after my mom aborted me
Bloody, fetus, baby of Satan, Devil's child
Leavin' bodies on all types of motherfuckin' level piles
So girl take fuckin' caution, cause if you're walking home alone tonight
Ya might wind up a bitch on auction
And if I can't take you while you're conscious hun
I'll be like Ralphus and shoot into you from my blowgun
[Ill Bill]
I'm stirring the pain in the center of ya brain
Poke a path with the butcher knife, walk down the lane
Take a stroll through the hole in your head
Stab a nigga dead, I'd like to paint the world blood red
Flippin' like O.J. Simpson, the Joel Rifkin, covered with crimson
Everywhere you look another dead shook (shook)
On the meat hook hangin'
Then I'm off in your place to spread your wife's legs for the bangin'
I love to fuck retarded chicks with wiffle ball bats, then watch they
Fuckin' head go splat when I pull out the gat
I'm also into sodomizing secretaries, I'm very scary
My ice pick rips through virgin cherries
And all you goon's that think you got half of what me and my brother got
Get chopped chopped chopped like Bobbit's cock
[Hook (emphasize on the last DIE!)]
[Necro]
Necrophiliac, nineteen-ninety gore
ILL Cannibill, nineteen-ninety gore
Eat my shit
Eat my shit
Eat my shit
Eat my shit
You're sucking dick for crack
You're sucking dick for crack

I love everything about money
You can be a millionaire and never pay taxes
Rust, I got to bust to my destination
I woke up late time from other transportations
Trains and busses - public adorations so better turn
But where I'm going to is a place where it really burns
And burns my brain, my job, my occupation
Another motherfucking source of frustration
4, 25$ an hour, leaves my mouth sour
Minimum wages like I'm caged in the prison tower
Day in and day out another person flips
They can't cope so they create their own economics
With an Uzi some ammunition and a flat jacket
Stick up kids, wanna be fat like Buddy Hacket
And get props, ranks, thanks, power position
A piece of paper with a picture of a dead politician
So many times I've seen people play stupid for money
And at the funeral it isn't funny
But nevertheless the world turns, it doesn't burn
Cause money make the world go round is what I always heard
That's when I got that sadly look on my face
No matter how fast I run, I always wind up in last place
So I just like to would pick myself up an automatic
So I can end my fate check without a denim static
Got nothing to lose except my head
Yo I'm in it to win it and imma spray the town blood red
Autroprenorial skills coming all fly
And economically it doesn't matter if somebody die
It's all about getting the dollars and jewel specs
So give it up before I put your life in fast checks
Yeah I got money coming out my ass
Yeah I got money coming out my ass

[Ill Bill]
A general can never live with the shame of defeat
Play the position the same way in the street, labeled a creep
Raised in the ways of the deep thinkers at the same time
I learned the most valuable things
From an uncle leaving syringes stuck in his veins
Heroin dreams, cocaine wishes
Seen a dope fiedn suck a dog's dick for a fix and
It's twisted and sick on this immaculate planet on which we live
That's why I keep a black bag of ammonia by my side ever since
Hollow tip shells, one in the chamber
Sign my name in blood, smudgen the paper
Too many crab motherfuckers and haters
Looking at me like I fucked their moms
Till they wind up hog tied in the trunks of their cars
It ain't no sunshine, I can smell the jealousy and envy
You're thinking my glass is half full, I'm thinking it's half empty
I think above the law, surpass insanity
Smear your blood on the wall like the Manson Family
Wtahc your mouth you don't know me homie
Ill Bill, inappropriate like holding a baby, smoking a bogie
Blow your brains out; leave you with an empty head, cause I'm a muthafucking villain like MC Ren
[Hook 2X: Ill Bill]
I live the same life you lead, breathe the same air you breathe
We similar, but no, you my enemy
Bang the fuck out in the street, hold the block down with heat
We similar, but no, you my enemy
[Raekwon]
From every valley all the way to the valley is where allies live
With 40 Calies, winging drugs, selling Denalies
Where coke comes in big ol trucks, Dickies, white tees
Authentic Chucks, stash it in the boards for the cause
Alot of rap killers is lurking, base heads chirping
All these police workers got they hats backwords, and black hoods
Guard it like the Pope up in Rome
Slight cough, rhyming through foam, pajama sets, talking to Tone
I live through my family, civilians and loved ones
Take drugs and slay for my paper
Working under some fakers
I recognize the power of loyalty, come for the wants and needs
Everything else black, self explanatory
Take it back to Timexes and Outies
Push it through 1-39th, seeing Spanish, Jesus and Ralphie
You know who we came, it's holding besides breaded was lead
Go head, search us, guns is by the shoulders
You counting every one in back of the store
Different whores will jump out, different walls smelling like cum
Nowadays niggas know hustling
Yeah, go head, tell it wrong and get jinxed by the FBI
Word to every kingpin's wish
Move humble and hard, play the right men, slay the right bitch
Through the mix of concurrent drama
We honor niggas that died, got trapped up and fell behind karma
This real nigga lecture his destiny
Play the perfect hand of perfection, everything's a blessing at heart
I sat back like the giant from start, play number two position learn
To listen, gamble insmarts
Now we pushing from town to town
Realizing credit's the shit, but can't trust no niggas around
I try to establish life on my own, blaze a hundred bones
And think, I'm painting by the second, it's on
Yo, call the flag of a Muslim son, who base his life on guns and murder
Free business, handling chumps
Now alot of niggas is gone, sleeping on the Rican on the catwalk
Hump on his leg, back on his own
A wise man set up for failure
[Interlude: Raekwon]
Yo, yo, yo, untie him man
[Hook 2X]

Intro:
[Female interviewer:] Don’t you think education should make people aware of the danger of the danger of technology instead of making them adapt more easily to any kind of progress and technology
[Male interviewee:] Absolutely, absolutely, that we can no long allow technology to come roaring down at us, I think we must begin to say no to certain kinds of technology and to begin technological change because we’ve now reach the point that the technology is so powerful that it could destroy us
[Verse 1]
He
 was accepted with 
Harvard
 at sixteen
Child prodigy
Math with specializing in complex analysis geometry
Earned a PHD in mathematics early
Youngest professor ever hired by UC in Berkeley
A short-lived position
He resigned in '69 with no apology
Without an explanation given
Social anxiety multiplied silently
Disconnected entirely from society
Built a cabin
, became a survivalist
Rejected electricity and modern sciences
He cooked his dinner in a fire pit
And watched the 
stars from afar where Orion sits
The wilderness where the lions live
Primitive like the times of the giant pyramids the Mayans built
Then something caused his mind to chill
A course solidified successfully the very first time he killed
[Hook]
What would you do, how far would you go
If you thought that you can change the world for the greater good
How would you know
What’s right or wrong
Try to play God
Mail a bomb
To the CEO or the school or an airline
Do you justify murder for peace?
Do you believe that technology is the beast?
Imagine if your iPhone disappeared
That would be weird
Could you function in a world without technology
Or would you be scared?
[Verse 2]
Exploding octopus, block buster in the 6 finger hand
Booby trap a box to shock the populace with wishful plans
Initially ignored
"Industrial society and its future"
The manifesto of Kaczynski's war
Life in seclusion
Rivals and bruises
Rifles and 
UZIs
Devices with clues designed to confuse the FBI
Throw 'em off plans
Blowing off hands
Blinding people first
Soon the results were even worse
Became obsessed with teaching society a lesson
With home made weapons
 that reach society’s perception
The Washington Post and The Times finally printed his manuscript
That was the tipping point that notified his family
With suspicion leading to his arrest
His brother recognized his writing style
 and mission of death
Ran up in his cabin and discovered undeniable proof of his guilt
Sixteen bombs, twenty-three injured and three killed
[Hook]

Verse 1]
I spit on behalf of my death cult made of millions of morbid angels
Standing in a burning church in Norway lost in hatred
Of course Satan smiles through the face of a child
Whose born with the number of the Devil scraped into his scalp
We don’t like none of y’all at all
My fuck your mother in the mouth type of dawgs might write this song
Triple X bitches call me and invite me home
They run up on me on the street in then invite me dome
I spit the truth for the youth movement, it’s goon music
Engineered to make you bang your motherfucking head to it
Learn ships, live fast lives and spit flames then burn bitches with crackpipes like Rick James
Ill Bill, I’m from Brooklyn where the stars are born
I make drug music plus I be involved in porn
I be the chosen like Robby Benson beyond comprehension
Holding a 
toaster like Bronson in Death Wish
[Hook x 2]
Black metal, I cock back react thorough
In la botanica con el santero
Black mask, white robe, shrouded in peril
Trapped me in the war between God and the Devil
[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
I know a 
babalawo
 who cuts chicken heads
I fuck chicken heads man that 
Santeria
 shit is fucking wild
I’m feeling like my time running out
I’m the middle of the block guns drawn when they gun it down
I break speed limits on the highway to Hell
They got the Devil chasing me trying to give me life without bail
I drink spirits and smoke form for medicine
And inhale elements of 
sickle cell
You can catch me in the hood like 
VD
That Sixth Side Street shit homes and we ain’t deal with the PD
The most hated on the block with no greatest
Crash through the storm and attack the storm raiders
I shoot the shit with Shaman, my spirit is still starving
Imagine all the shit that my soul famine is causing
Knife-carving nine on the psychos at night swarming
I fight to be righteous but the murder is more calm
[Hook x 2]
[Verse 3: Q-Unique]
I been forced to fulfill a dark and hateful agarro
And was born the son of a Satan santero
Burn black candles for a black Sabbath
After the fact the priest converted her to a crack addict
It’s flat madness with black gats and black magic
Sit and watch the death of faces and laugh at it
With two white pale goth bitches lost in an orgy
And you too could subscribe for the cost of a forty
I got the blood of the faceless pagans on me
A sacred place praying to raise a Haitians army
The Babalawo wolf from Brooklyn in all white
White fitted, white Nikes, 
moving that pure white all night
Make a bruha scream chango and fuck their brains out
Your ice crucifix won’t save you, tuck your chains now
Between heaven and hell pa’ arriba y pa’ abajo
Knowing the devil itself vamos pa’l carajo
[Hook x 2]

(Verse)
The truth is being cast aside
We’ve been dooked into a vast mirage
I’m a cross between master fon and a astronaut
Murderous appetite, war games and transic cops
Virginal sacrifice, coronage of panic ops
Father of abomination like Manson's pops
Blood ceremony homie, make sure the dagger's sharp
Pocket down briefcase, exchange cosmic shots
Diamonds and golden guns, smashing you with hands of bronze
Rap pin calm with the cameras on
Drop the creek, touch a gramatonic Babylon
I’m 1000 horse power when the mag the bomb
With more than enough fire power to splatter yall
It puts a shootout at the Grimy Awards, I spent 90 in court
I took the murder and deprive assault
Beat the case, roll the dice and I walk
Like a forty deuce Hebrew played the corner of a mic when I talk
(Hook x4)
The conviction of my tape is rape, wicked like Nixon
Long-heads inscriptions with three sixes in
Kiss the pyramid experiment with high explosive
I slap-box with Jesus, lick shots at Joseph
(Verse)
From gunning to glory, another young hustler’s story
Learn from the mistakes of my uncle that done it before me
But choppa base death, horror, leave children crying
Get out like slayer throat form, slick pushin rhymes
Young shooters bring a pistol full
Caught up in that crucifixion rituals
While worshiping Lucifer habitual
The streets raised me, I’m from Brooklyn like Jordan to Jay-Z
To be where I’m from is a great thing
While yall daydream I make things happen
Get things clapping, spray things laughing
18 I stopped taking acid
,
But it left a stain on my brain that remain massive
Thoughts of perceptional open 'til they lay me in a casket
Until I stop making murder rap
Because the bible was written by those who were givens - the earth is flat
And I’ll be dead before this war stops
Praying that the author of the Warlocks the will throw rocks
(Hook x4)
(Verse; H.R.)
Yes, you bring some praises to the king of kings
And the lord of law is pumping my new frap of luna
He looked to, I’m bringing my Moscone and I’m like me welcome also
I’ve got a mind out of my mind
Oh I been up so once you love
Either Moscone, boy that’s your low
Boy let us do what she like
Kikeraimis Jerusalem
Il al alum, asrahum
Jehovia alam
Slash ey lovey
Steve link some praises too, to the king of kings
I’m the prophet lovay, I got out it
Of the almighty twelve tribes of Israeli
And the only holy god of Israel and also everywhere
With the purples drink
And the supernatural beings
Supernaturalistic kings and queens, yeah
With the purples drink
And the supernatural beings
In the burning bright
At the shining light
The will to chill with Ill Bill

[Necro]
I've conducted extensive research
Now every verse is corrupted, offensive to the church
Destructive demented words
You've been instructed by sentences in each word
Featured to suck you into a world invented to see you bleed first
My brutal arm is runnin' through your mind
Stabbin' up the cerebrum down to the spine, cut up the region
My personality represents the worst reality
Ever since a kid I rocked the reverse mentality
I give no apologies for my biology
Don't follow me and I qualified to have my qualities
You're disqualified, you get no equality
Senseless homicide equals Necro psychology
I'm the leading authority in subjects
Like beatings that leave you bleeding orally, a part of me's obsessed
A major label would've been the end of me
I was meant to be an independently runned entity
I've got the illest mind, it's corroded like Philas Villa's spine
Like thirty eight serial killers combined
It takes one individual act
To stop you from kickin' a pitiful rap, it's a miserable fact
You'll get visibly hacked into shreds and left for dead
Gushing from your head with a pair of scissors attached
It's wizardry the way you disappear from the earth physically
Covered up exquisitely
Smothered up with pillows militantly
You see, you dyin as quiet as can be is the key
I obtained a sick brain
From the streets of Brooklyn with a need to inflict pain
[Ill Bill]
I smile for the cameras like Berkowitz
You can't interpret this
Murderous, stab you in the face perfect fit
Slice precise like a surgeons wrist
Another verse that slips into the grips of the perverse and sick
There's nothing worse than this
There's nothin more horrifying than people with the thirst for piss
And faeces like G G Allin with german chicks
Imagine a minute before a person flips
A minute they be strangled with the blue face the purple lips
Leaving you lyin' on the cold floor, mouth open
Found you bloated a week later wreakin' of fowl odor
Fuck the fake scriptures
We sacrilegiously sacrifice you in the name of satan and take pictures
My laboratory table's bottle nosed
It's already too late and you've just noticed that you've been followed home
Look into my eyes, hollow hole
Ill Bill, cold blooded demon from hell without a soul
I'm responsible for bandagin' the impossible
If you listen to Uncle Howie and Psycho-Logical Lots of guns, lots of ghouls, gonna cost a fool
We the reason Doctors are appointed at the hospital

Hey yo, I smoke dust and shoot cops, 
sold guns to 2Pac
Smoked blunts with Biggie Smalls and sold drugs
 on new-lots
I was too young, couldn't get up in clubs back in the old days
We used rob and terrorize kids in front of homebase
When Funkmaster Flex was inside, rockin' the whole place
We was outside, smacking kids and snatchin' gold chains
Baggin' mad pigeons, catchin' mad digits, bad bitches
And when they husbands came around we had to blast biscuits
A bunch of bad Brooklyn kids that always had pistols
Broken dreams and broken halls, we always had issues
And mad problems worshippin' gangstas and bank-robbers
Watchin' Scarface startin' fights in Rap concerts
Until we realized how to get the real money
Steal money, kidnap money, kill money
Its funny how the money make the whole world love you
Jealous cats hate you, dime bitches want you
Little ghetto children run up on you, wanna' touch you
Got the IRS lookin' at you, wanna fuck you
Sniffin' so much blow, you don't know if you can trust you
Ecstasy react to what the cocaine and the dust do
Go against the Ill Bill and Non Phixion will crush you, bust you
Leave you with a tube and ya' throat to suck through
We truck jewels, these dust brothers fuck mothers
The thugs love us, rap for the gunslingers and drug-hustlers
Where my gangstas at?
[Cuts]
"Is you a gangsta?"
"With gangsta rap"

[Uncle Howie]
"Glenwood mother-fuckin' Projects, that was the fuckin' place man. Fuckin'
Crack smoking all night. Cookin' it up, sellin' C4, weapons, blowguns, every
Mother-fuckin' thing - what a fuckin' rush. We were cookin' the shit up, an'
I smoked it up an' the Jamaicans man, they came back, fuckin' torched the
Place, with me mother-fuckin' in it! I couldn't get out the fuckin
Apartment, they locked me in, I had to go out the fuckin window, it was
Fuckin' dynamite!"
[Ill Bill]
Ill Bill lost sanity - lost humanity
Lost in a maze of purple haze, cannabis sativa - spit ether - violently
Very vociferous - victorious - hotter than a crematorium - I'll kill all of you
Kill you - mother-fuck you - Drop dead faggit it's the dragon
.44 Magnum - splatter you in front of your family
My fire arms, never be tired - up in the air
Throw a bullet up in each eye - an' one in ya ear
I speak heroin
, breathe weed, sniff cocaine
Tweaked levels when I peeped Courtney kill Cobain
We got the whole world scratching they heads
Life is like a high-jacked airliner, but we managed to win
Back to the crib, breakin up the cash and the brick
Havin a bitch - flashin the tits - While you crashing the whip
Laughin at hoes, taking 
facials
 in amateur flicks
While the Ill Bill albums kidnapping your kids
[Hook - Ill Bill x2]
I put the D into Drugs an' the G into Guns
I put the D into Dubs an' the T into Thugs
I put the C into 'Caine an' the P into Pain
The G into Game, Pop-Pop - three in ya brain
[Necro]
I get impatient like a long bid - get so vexed I hit the wrong kid
Shit gets awkward, like I'm on a drug an' I can't get off it
Blank out - rip a shank out
Treat you like Vietcong - hit you like the weed in a bong
Your pussy like a G-string or thong
You think I'm sick? Fucked up? Oh am I?
You think you can't die?
Don't think your crazy cuz a years passed by
Beat you down with my fuckin' hands tied
Now change your attitude, before you get cracked from different latitudes
By kids that are mad at you - they expect gratitude
I'll strike a foe - even if you don't know me you better act like you know
Especially if you're soft - 
I've earned my stripes like Schwarzkopf
The gun I bust off will tear through your clothes like a moth
Your sloppy, cuz you start beef, and cop plees, but not me...
[Hook - Ill Bill x2]
I put the D into Drugs an' the G into Guns
I put the D into Dubs an' the T into Thugs
I put the C into 'Caine an' the P into Pain
The G into Game, Pop-Pop - three in ya brain
[Goretex]
I rock sickening raps like Woody Allen flares beach hats
Or John Hinckley - run up on politicians with ski caps
Laser weapons - I bleed coke, 
happiness is like a warm gun
Run in ya crib slitting ya G's throat
Cruise the block, whippin' uzi's an' pop
Loosin the cops, whether new lots or zooming through Watts
The newest space suite, love rocking titties like grapefruits
Phase two - Rasta-ice inverted "Hey-Zeus" (Jesus)
I'm up in fat burger - bagging some codeine
So clean, pinstripe gat runners are Old G's
Serving the fiends crack, dope and weed
Glenwood projects - we living the American dream
Screaming "hey pelican" - trains of coke on my cock
Handle bars like "Vivica" - with nipples and crotch
We toured - drive-bys on the mongoose with Glocks
This ain't rhetorical, the story gets worse - you get shot
[Hook - Ill Bill x2]
I put the D into Drugs an' the G into Guns
I put the D into Dubs an' the T into Thugs
I put the C into 'Caine an' the P into Pain
The G into Game, Pop-Pop - three in ya brain

Yeah. William cutting, check it
There's three stages of Free Masons
Green papers written in diseased hatred
Be patient, wait for the egyptian translation
David and Goliath at war, achieve greatness
Seen agents with biological agents in briefcases
Holy shit homie, this ain't what the prophecies of the Bible said
Leviathan, a cross between lucifer and a scientist
Sitting in a pentagram, octagon
Reading from the necronomicon with 
octomom
?fuck the fembot that shot Oscar Goldman
My operation costs six billion
Goddamnit you should've told them who I am
Ill Bill, goonsday, it's doomsday
The Forty-deuce black hebrew goonface, my tool spray
It takes forty-two muscles to frown
And only four to click the trigger of a four-pound
I'm falling down
My bullets'll melt your face like the end of Raiders
Pop your fucking cranium open like a baked potato

[Intro: Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, uh, yeah
We back y'all
Uh, AOTP
This was what y'all's was waiting for, right?
Yeah, nothing but that classic, classic... nothing but that classic, classic
[Verse 1: Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, yo
I stay strolling with Crypt
My opening 'graph
 
like the smoke from a fifth
Cup of gin,
 devilish grin, bodies cozy and stiff
It's the messiah, think the black Moses of myth
I hold the staff and turn snakes into Netherland piff
I spit the 'glyphics and the mystics,
 you know what it give
One eye, bloodshot, on a pyramid tip
It's real energy, you a high school chemistry kit
The ease, the crease, get a whole energy lift
If your hate since '98, Kamachi and Hologram
And '07, he the reverend of the lawless land
I crack crosses, I'm here for the fall of man
AOTP, this is what you call a jam
[Verse 2: Demoz]
Nigga I'll leave you poked in the chest
If hip-hop is dead, call me ghost in the flesh
I'm close to the best
Kill your fucking man, have a toast to the death
Gotta be a ball game if I'm approaching the bench
Coke on the steps, po-po lock me up
Came home, now we just waiting on mafia
Jay I got you, Vinnie I see you
Crypt, King Size, Planetary, no need to
Display no one else's name, we all lethal
We came from a flame a hundred below evil
Nigga, I'll shoot you, I'll stab you
I'll knock your fucking jaw off your face if I smack you
Who's Luke, who's John, who's Paul, who's Matthew
I don't read the fucking Bible, nigga I just get at you
I'll make a bunch of crazy white boys kidnap you
Let you know this is real true life, no battle
[Hook: Demoz]
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad
[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
You knew the white boy was wild nice
And then I stick the cooker to your ribs like fried rice
I got some cousins moving D at a wild price
That have the dope fiends lean mean when they pound spikes
The aim's sloppy dog, 
knife work mean
Stick it through the neck, pull it out
Knife work clean (ha ha ha ha)
The God's righteous, but I might serve fiends
And the four-fifth lift you out your iceberg jeans
I got a lot of young boys and they mad hungry
Murder, kill, shoot the place up, stab for me
This ain't the type of place you can survive God (not at all)
God don't live inside me, I live inside God
[Verse 4: Doap Nixon]
I ain't messing with nines, nah
I give them shits to my broad
I only mess with big shit, with the shoulders involved
Throw your body in the river so the odor dissolve
A headshot, leave your brain under the motor of your car
For real, you can bet your last, 
I split plenty wigs
It's KTK, Kenny the Kid
And I'm still in the hood, money, getting them packs off
Side of the barrel, dog
It feel like a scratch-off
Broad daylight, the hood's like Iraq
I got good aim, peephole niggas get eye-clapped
And we all on ease, all in greens, all in trees, and we all gon' squeeze
AOTP, niggas be running game on you
And I ain't talking about my money's gonna rain on you
I'm talking about the shit that dent up your car
Get mines and big phasers or I'm clipping your broad, faggot
[Hook: Demoz]
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad, motherfucker get lost
AOTP, every member is a boss
Can you pay the price when your life is the cost
Will you crack under pressure, take another loss
This is a gun ballad

[Vinnie Paz]
I murder you and laugh
I'm Barry Sanders slashin' through the path
You a magician's assistant
I'm sawin' you in half
You a heathen that rely on the beast
I'm a demon at the fire crucifyin' the priest
I shine over beats
A motherfuckin' beast on the mic
I'm a lion out the jungle, raw meat what I like
I bleed in a fight, Vinnie like the taste of his blood
And I'll open up your stomach like the case of a slug
I'm faithful to drugs,
 
puttin' metal plates in your mug
Dump your body in the motherfuckin' lake in a rug
Face in the mud,
 
y'all create the facade
That my people have exterminated faith in they god
Patience is hard, cousin, but it pays to be calm
Go to war for anybody who embraces Islam
I'm gracious and warm, ready for the place in the war
And I'm ready to smash your motherfuckin' face in the floor
[Hook]
We got that gangster gangster shit
"The heavy metal king hold big shit"
We got that murder murder shit
You talk that gangster gangster shit
We live that murder murder shit
[Ill Bill]
Without order nothing exists, without chaos nothing evolves
Now get on your knees so I can stick this gun in your mouth
I'm a slayer album personified
, 
Holocaust
, 
Columbine
Middle Passage
, 
Israel versus Palestine
It's the cult leader drink your Kool-Aid
Roll with the doctors that produce AIDS
I open my mouth, I shoot flames
The freedom fighter that got the whole world terrified
Ill Bill, human manifestation of genocide
Stand amongst Grammy winning grimy
 
nose candy sniffers
Blast the black metal at you
 
like Danny Lilker
It's impossible to escape my matrix of hate
I'll make a good girl a cum dumpster, Satan awaits
Set the razors to AKs
 and 
turn rasins to grapes
Turn blood into wine with an insatiable taste
Drink from the goblet of gore
, vomiting porn
Sodom and Gomorrah
 back to 
Canarsie New York
[Sample]
Is this the bringing of the king to his parliament
Till the land was all undone and darkened by such deeds
[Hook]
[Vinnie Paz/Louie Dogs]
You don't know about the gospel of Judas
About the information found in the
 
Galapagos Ruins
How the warriors would sharpen they blades
How if they government wanted to they could cure you of AIDS
We the equivalent of fire and ice
The equivalent of a prisoner who die for his rights
I'm lyin' to Christ, put your fuckin' spine in a vice
I'm like Trump in the Apprentice, only fire at night
I'm dyin' to fight, 
slap you five and put ten in you
Louie Dogs
, a fuckin' genocide general
So I say fuck the CIA and they plan
Get me outta here I'd rather fuckin' stay in Iran
I'll run up on you with grenades in my hand
If you fuckin' round with Bill or try to hate on my fam
It's the dichotomy of hatred in man
If you ever even think of tryin' to play me then blam
Blap bap
[Hook]

[Hook: Steven King]
I hear loud niggas talking but they don’t really want it
My gauge’ll blow your motherfucking brains out
Soon as you act retarded the gat’ll start sparking
I’ll show you what my motherfucking name bout
I’mma do what I gotta do, I ain’t taking no shorts
And get away clean cause I paid off the courts
It’s real, duke, I ain’t playing, this shit ain’t a game
I’mma burn you to flames cause Howie made me do it
[Verse 1: Steven King]
It’s Steven King, I spit nothing but classics
And it’s ill how I turn beef to nothing but caskets
And your grill look like the Expedition done crashed it
I’m like a bunny rabbit, I be taking your carats
More money more drama, don’t make me catch an open case
For opening your face, you’re soft like Hostess cake
I wanna live fat, I gotta eat what Oprah ate
So I hold niggas up with the one plus eight
I’m the man of the year
You so whack that niggas put their hands on their ears
And tell you, “Shut the fuck up.”
And the only dog that roll with you is on the Fedex truck
Now here’s the score: ten-zip and I ain’t talking about the disc
I’m talking about extended clips, smoking in expensive whips
Four-four’s the end of shit, give you a Hell’s membership
I been equipped, don’t ever forget it like elephants
You violate I’ll put a hole in your melon
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
You like a campfire, homes, I light you up with all types of guns
The vampire, homes, 
I’m drinking all nine pints of blood
Stop you in your tracks like clogged up syringes
Destroy the evidence after I chopped up the witness
A cheapskate, I keep my money locked up for interest
Fuck the industry, y’all faggots make me not trust the business
Ill Bill, right money make a murder make sense
I make brains squirt out their heads right in front of their friends
I ain’t a nice guy at all, dog, lifestyle raw y’all
Sell drugs, tour, 
smoke nudies
, and fuck whores
Got black bitches with white eye shadow that like to swallow
And 
white bitches that pop their pussies for Heineken bottles
I’m a dirtbag with brand new sneakers, throwback over the Desert Eagle
Blow your face off, leave you forever peaceful
Like a newborn dead inside of a crib
I cock back, empty Dessies in the side of your wig, faggot
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Syn Roc]
Too hot, create semi caliber, I’mma cock it
I treat your life like a cheque, homeboy I’mma dock it
Call me a prophet, it’s guaranteed you all gonna bleed
The murder game is a race and I’m taking the lead
Fast and furious nigga like my gun got nitro
Playing games like Tyco,
 mama told me I’m psycho
And I believe her, now the clique running streets like cheetahs
We’ll meet up and put holes all in your wifebeaters
From BK to Queens we be pointing them things
Have your Ecko shirt looking like some damaged jeans nigga
It’s Syn Roc, the kid who got your grandpop shot
Over a game of bingo, I take the cream out his socks
In a cloud of weed is the place where you find me
And I stole drink forties like I’m stuck in the 90’s
Nigga I’m grimy, wilding on the 
alcho temp
Try to front on me and get hit with sixteen clips
[Hook]
[Verse 4: E-Dot]
Alright ahk who wanna fuck round?
It’s the Dot, you hear the pop nigga duck down
? canuck, I’m repping cop killer Bucktown
That good up in the backwood rough sound
Begging for mercy talking about, “Alright. Enough now.”
Hold up and y’all hammers bust pow
Enough, get touched like ooh ah ow
You suck, push your luck, get laid the fuck down
Get bucked, I was a wild off the hook child
Played tough plus steroids came in big viles
Puff puff puff liked to buy weed in big pounds
Crack that Dutch, I ain’t addicted I’m just in denial
When I blow then I flow like the river Nile
Find you anywhere like your cellphone, can you hear me now?
Grab you by your hair and shake it till I tear it out
I’m sorta like mildly retarded but very wild
Cause Howie made me do it, stupid

[Sample from the movie Armageddon]
[Verse 1]
If the apocalypse started today
Some of us would try to hide
And some of us would cry to God and pray
It's a dangerous world on a fragile axis
Most of us aren't prepared if society ever collapses
Major volcanic to earthquake events
Tsunamis swallowing cities
Drown entire populations to death
It could be nuclear, biological or chemical war
Or 
martial law
 or we could 
just run out of oil
Those with major health issues won't survive
Anyone on dialysis or a respirator device will die
When the power-grid fails
 for days, weeks or months or years
Think about that possibility with fear
Power failure leads to no food or water
Leading to collapse of law and order
Then massive robberies and slaughters
Riots and looting
Widespread violence and shootings
Gunshot battles
Survivors take rifles and Uzis
[Hook]
I'll show you how to survive the apocalypse
I'll show you how to survive the end of the world
[Verse 2]
Having guns ain't the key to survival though
They're just a piece of a big puzzle
Of course it's 'bout what you know
Practical skills are your most valuable tool
Don't fall into the same trap that most amateurs do
Buy your beans, bullets and band-aids
Cause in the last days money's worthless
What will matter is what you have to trade
So practice raising a vegetable garden
After the apocalypse you can survive
If you are an exceptional farmer
Old technology could be your salvation
Study how the old world survived before modern civilization
Gaining water, food, shelter, fuel, communications
And build weapons and tools that once used to rule nations
Share and watch each others backs
Choose your friends wisely
Increasing the probability of everyone surviving
But most of all build your self reliance
Protect your family
And make sure always be prepared for violence

[Ill Bill]
Yo...
We got a black president
, 
the aliens will be here soon
Open up your eyes and your ears, here's the truth
Beyond blind faith we don't really know what to believe
The meaning behind these old books could be anything
Who the fuck translated these words from Aramaic
To the language spoken in the empire of the hated?
We the children of a lesser God
Make me want to pull an Escobar, and I ain't fuckin talkin 'bout Nas
I'm serious like a swastika
Or playing 
Russian roulette
, over hard liquor
Or Hamas after bombin' a Bar Mitzvah
Or Israel after bombin' the Gaza Strip up, it's constant
This tit for tat, raising our little kids with gats
Throwing gang signs like Bloods and Crips with bandanas on they face
Sometimes the bandana's on their brains
This prison planet tries to shackle me in chains every day
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Illuminati triple-six
, 
just study Koresh
Mullets and bullet belts encourage the best
Entourage of Gods, from Mossads to Qurans
Church Ave. to the Taj Mahal we rock hard
[Ill Bill]
Homie you dealing with professionals that make murder look like suicide
With silencers the size of an ordinary Jewish child
Bazookas made from linoleum tubing
And you stupid to think that "Lord of War" was only a movie
Depraved enterprise, brain energized seven times
Genocide high-level lies, truth serum identified
Organic mushrooms given to prisoners who don't trust you
Meanwhile the mass population consumes
I'm in a catch 22
, 
too smart for my own good
Intergalactical, too smart for my own hood
My X-ray vision see through this tinted image
Wipe the dust off reality's lens to spit vicious
Molotov monologues at y'all, let's brawl
Storming through the valley of the dolls carryin kronze
Attack like angry extra-terrestrials challenging God
Arrive in chariots armed with various cannons and bombs
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I hold my pistol like the bible
Turn the page to a verse of vengeance
Volcanoes of violence erupt in the words of each sentence
Here's a toast to the death of my enemies
My energy similar to the devil's chi
My treachery stretch for centuries
Menacing venomously
Make you hemmorage tremendously
My five senses suspended in weed and Hennessy
You bleed endlessly
My greed gets me everything, pussy, cars, anything
The means to fulfill any dream
I'm a fiend for the better things
La Coka Nostra, my team be veterans
Uncle Howie get the cream, who's better bitch?
Forever rich, lock me up and throw away the key, I'll still never snitch
I'm a goon
[Hook]
(Wild style goons in the room)
I'm a goon with a golden six-shooter and a mullet
I'm a goon
We the ones that they write movies about
(Uncle Howie goons take over)
[Verse 2]
I make the mosh pit spin like the Anthrax "Indians" video
Here we go a cross between Slipknot and Willie Bobo
So dope I cause relapses and overdoses
Explosive like stone tablets in the hands of Moses
The most focused on global implosion
Bill burn the truth into your eyes leaving both of them smoking
Smile for the barrel, swallow the magnum
Laughing in your face while the back of your head is vomiting fragments
You can't kill Bill, that was a movie
, 
you can't move me
Withstand the maximum impact of Uzis or AK-47s
I'm already dead
, it's ILL BILL the 2011 Melle Mel
Motherfucker what's really real? Really ill?
Run up on you, hit you with israeli steel yo we really will
Through windshields, windpipes and car seats
You die on the belt parkway next to Canarsie
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I'm a goon in a world of atheists and religious fanatics
Pimps, whores, drug dealers, drug addicts
Rock stars, rappers, actors and other characters
Starfuckers and cocksuckers and million dollar savages
Negotiate with blowtorches to faces
Vacation, the golden nugget, made a fortune in Vegas
I'm the greatest, perfect methods of execution painless, popped in the ear of the stainless
Leave even geniuses brainless
Leave the general population shocked and horrified
Fucking with me you might as well have been born to die
My values are loyalty, truth, respect, and honor
My family's royalty, my life is an endless drama
My art is death and I'm about to paint masterpieces
Catastrophes, shattered dreams, amputees
Forgiveness is between you and god I just arrange the meeting
I just arrange the firing squad, arrange the bleeding, I'm a goon
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Mr Hyde]
Metaphysical, satanic, a dramatic episode
I bet my scissors will wreak havoc on lymphatic nodes and toes
You ain't met a killer yet with intellect to fill a Tec
That's why I slit your neck and jet and have a second side of [?]
All you'll get is silhouettes and not a drop of DNA
While you rot away, decay, I'm being jocked at VMAs
See it matters that you scatter when I shoot the 45th
Cuz you could get your data spider out of your computer chip
How does it feel that you were hit, when the Glock that I shot rang
After I pop your top, I load your pockets with loose change
We get to smother guys after a baby's mother dies
Traumatized by my replies to dumb fucks with knives
Hyde's rotten, disdainful, sick, and plotting to maim you
It's hot and painful when you're shot with a brainful
We're bringing out the dead, drill and drink up what you bled
Sleeping with your mother's carcass, and it's stinking up my bed
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Sleaze merchant, my diseased verses freeze meat curtains
Chop you in little pieces like white castle cheeseburgers
Even worse than the prostitution of teen virgins
Double D nurses surrounded by murderous creeps and perverts
Circle of surgeons, the urgent, prose of perversion
Doctors with shotguns, surgery, 2009 version
The most evasive, with explosive hatred
Cultivation of the ultimate code to Satan
It's a bizarre and replsive nation
It embraces your soul like murder initiation
Suicidal ayatollah, more aliver than an al Qaeda soldier
With a dirty bomb on his shoulders
You are entering the Circle of Tyrants
A world of sex, money, drugs, murder, and violence
We the next step after the planes, The bullet that exits
Your skull after it splatter your brains
[Verse 3: Goretex]
Garbage bags from Ronnie, two shotties from '94
Body you down with the same frown that I had before
I ain't at war with Satan, it seems this is my destiny
On my shoulder, these feelings like he's the only one next to me
The urge to splurge on your chest, it manifests
[?] my new [?] will tear through your flesh, 
putrid, like poop sex
[?] of my shovels, still damp from the bloody waters
The balls to ambush your crib, rocking a grill like [?]
Chainsaws and [?] aimed at clitorises
Young vixens in coffins, victims in storage, cut into meaty portions
Cuz I'm sneaky, rip the fucking corpse and I'm off
Light a torch, a wizard of gore and killing, for villains, we set it off
Keys to the mortuary deep in his suit
Tools of the trade, I'm equipped to drain your image for food
Gross as hell like I'm Joe Spinell
I treat hoes like mannequins slashing their throat with shells
Like post mortem kills
[Verse 4: Necro]
Nothing like a violent vignette with a murderous minuet
If you ain't got no fear, it's cuz I ain't put any in you yet
Blinding you with science, give you an acid eye rince
Your asinine pastor gets blasted by the Circle of Defiance
I'll hurt you again, perform surgery with a pen
I'm like ten cats in one, I'm one cat that murders ten!
Leave you looking like melted American cheese
Rotting like Lou Gehrig's disease, somebody bury you please!
My popular stances are vile like testocular cancer
Like Pazuzu's grill
 or the posture of a pastor
Get away from me when I change into a stranger
With a banger, cuz the word "anger" is one letter short of "danger"
Spread like a herpes whore, it's Murphy's Law
Everything goes wrong, but we stay strong like a serpent's jaw
Strangle you, kick you in the skull, like a kangaroo
I'm like pachenga, juxin with [?], you're through!

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Apocalypse, the angel of death, the octopus
The two-headed eagle, thirty-third degree Hebrew
I speaks Mossad, Hamas, and the Hezbollah
And the CIA-funded Guatemalan terror squads
The Pentagon’s the TV producer, the war’s the product
And the media’s the salesperson hustling consumers
Global instability, terror networks, embassy bombings
A thousand ways to get the century popping
When mobs of people storm the neighbourhood banks
Riots in Time Square paralyzed by suicide bombings and tanks
Confined to evil, rides are regal
Emperors are ripped from their thrones by the people and then shot in their cerebral
One got away, created an empire made of fire
Now he crying that the CIA made him wear a wire
Now he getting waterboarded up with some pliers
Pulling out his fingernails every time he tell a lie
[Hook]
Pyramids of Mars AKA Kill Devil Hills
Existence of God, Jihad, Kill Devil Kill
Criminal official walk through with limited edition pistols
The symbolism twist you when the clips hit you
Pyramids of Mars AKA Kill Devil Hills
Existence of God, Jihad, Kill Devil Kill
Criminal official walk through with limited edition pistols
The symbolism twist you when the clips hit you
[Verse 2: B-Real]
So many notches in my belt of the victims I have accumulated
I got a vision, the light in my head illuminated
Your mind’s scattered and broken and battered
So what does it matter that a rat-ass bastard fell down Jacob’s ladder?
I climbed the pyramid and punch him in the eyeball
Give him a black eye, take a picture with my iPhone
Now his eye swolled ripping out my sidearm
They don’t like me, I’m ghetto, I spit and get my high on
Tell the truth a lot, been in this booth a lot
Keeping it raw whether I’m in a bad mood or not
Open your mind with the venomous rhyme ?
Lines born in a cypher
, you asked for a square deal
You see me grinning, your head is spinning
The symbolism is just like prison, I’m trying to free you from your condition
I got a suspicion you bitches are wishing me gone
I’m hitting the chron, a kiss on the cheek and it’s gone
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I’m a Freemason, I’m a Rosicrucian, I’m a Shriner
Moorish Science Temple of America’s Osama
Amun Nebu Re Akh Ta Al Mateen is the father
United Nuwaubian Nation of Moors rhymer
It’s wild hard tryna stay on my deen
I’m a bomb, I’m aram son of Shem and Fateem
Kill Devil Kill Devil Hill metal regime
I’m a rebel still, me and Bill devilish team
I’m a force to be reckoned with, I’m the deer hunter
The dirtbag to the underage beer runner
I like cold and snow, never revere summer
If God is a woman then I never hear from her
I’ll chop a tree with my hands, it appears lumber
I’m the definition of lightning, you fear thunder
I’m taking everything motherfucker so fear hunger
You have a soft heartbeat fucking queer drummer
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
Y’all should stop rhyming
I’m a G, hardbody, I am not common
This is destiny, it’s not luck, it’s not timing
And Vinnie staying in the hood like he Top Ramen
I ain’t ready for the stage until my fourth quart
I’m the de
finition of bully, a poor sport
However you want it, we can do it on your cour
t
My sword’ll cut your shit in half like it’s divorce court
I have G in my blood cause my pops had it
The straight left hits hard 
like it’s Scott Travis
I don’t fuck with anybody who is not savage
The GSG-5 leave your block ravished
I’m not sick, I control the disease
I got Lamas but not the ones that Napoleon feeds
Even the most protected soldier could bleed
Me and you ain’t nothing alike, we a whole different breed
[Hook: Ill Bill]
Yo, sawed-off or automatic, my aura cause static
Traumatic anarchy volcanic is organic
Heavy metal emperors, kings on the planet
Bring whores and Xanax, think more satanic
X pills, Vicodins, OCs, powder
Haze, OG kush, diesel and sour
Dust, chews, lucies, turbans, and kufis
Handguns, rocket launchers, shotguns, and UZIs
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Imported Italian leather sofas Valencia
Shooters imported from Chechnya
Put em underneath the dirt with the rest of ya
The skull and crown on the sword, four pound on ya boy
Cause entire crowds to applaud, ten thousand or more
Can never be contained, lyrically deranged, clinically insane
Critically acclaimed, I keep the industry afraid
They’ve been super nervous ever since we escaped
Goons with burners, destiny betrayed, refuse to lose or ever be a slave
A picture’s worth a thousand words but a symbol is worth a thousand pictures
We never fully understood the symbol found in scriptures
Swastikas spray-painted on the pyramids
Sometimes I feel like we’re just an experiment
Gold fronted up top to bottoms, cock the llamas
Mossad, Osama, jihad, Obama, call me the Skull Head
Like Four Horsemen combined in one warhead
You fuck around I’ll detonate and leave you all dead
[Hook: Ill Bill]

(Meyhem Lauren)
E Train, last car, 10 deep, left em drippin'
Blacking out, catching wreck, fly tags
 - 
peace to Griffen
Sneakers was Scottie Pippen
, 
denim was probably Guess
I’ve been Laurenovich since then, 
rockin my Snow Beach vest
Dolo fresh ox on, 
Polo Bear socks on
Freak dancing in the backstreet with our Glocks on
Hard rocks, hammers and heaters, they kept the blocks warm
Daily objective, being gone before the cops swarm
Holdin' TECs never sex, we was not porn
Streets made us then they raised us, we are not born
Gang shit was on the rise, but most my clique was neutral
Don't get it fucked up nigga, why? Most my clique will shoot you
Blam blam, without beads or a bandana
Bullets will make your face blurry like a bad camera
Peace to Queens nigga, home of that fly shit
Cop killa central, you die quick, what up tho?
(Hook)
Latin Quarter to L’amour East, we all beasts
From across seas to cross Queens, we all creeps
CBGB's to L’amour east, we all beasts
Smoke PCP
, 
kids get stabbed over graffiti beef
(Q-unique)
I took the 6 train to the Bronx for 
infinity lessons
With the rise of the crack rock had the vicinity stressin'
My zulu medallion over whatever we was wearin'
In the late 80’s we wasn’t born wild, we was made crazy
That movie Beat Street was so misleading
‘Cause some of the breakers I knew were stick up kids that leave you cold and bleeding
It wasn’t a happier time, New York was a fucking mess
Little yellow envelope stuffed with skunk and cess
Then I’m in the back of the B train with a four finger ring and a gold rope
Didn’t look like a rapper, I looked like somebody that sold dope
And maybe I did cause back home was no hope
But maybe because Rakim said he was no joke
And I wanted to be just like the god
Excelling my skill level, plus life was hard
Dog it was more realer back then, you would either deal or rap
The industry snatched from Brooklyn, I steal it back
[Hook] x 2
(Ill Bill)
Double L train Canarsie, fit tags, drippy markers
Albee Square,
 colloseum, 50 deep in king’s plaza
Flat leavers, crack slingers, cap peelers, rap singers
Blasted Desert Eagles, turning tracks forever ether
While the war planes scatter nukes
__ splatter goons
Sauteed magic shrooms, more strange antics soon
Blasting Paid in full,
 Dog Day Afternoon
Had to pay my dues, fought James after school
I snuffed John Hayes in front of Captain Video
Next to the 
Arch Diner
, Joey Haskall was with me too
That was before the gunplay 
and dapper dan jackets
Bootleg Timbaland leathers and automatic ratchets
Before Artie ___ blew his face off
Playin russian roulette after he vacuumed up a 8-ball
From childhood to manhood in King’s County
From my hood to yours we represent it proudly
Represent New York, represent Rowdy
Represent my whole crew, 
represent Howie
(Hook)

[Verse 1]
A drug deal gone bad, dead drug dealers, dead D.T.’s
A duffel bag of yeyo, at least seven keys
Pool party shoot out veteran, call me Jim Shooter
Whores copped, left me two guns with twin Rugers
Grand Theft Auto, sawed-off shotty party
Canarsie artie, rep the hood
,
The rap John Tardy with nines on me
Tell me who you be or you be gone
We squeeze chromes, stop you in your tracks
Fuck up your life like teen moms
One Hour Photo, creep out like Mork From Ork
Use the HK to speak when I talk the talk
Walk quietly and pop with the MP7
Put it to your melon, pop off and empty seven
Split you in half like when my mom and dad was divorced
Me and my peoples be the real life gangs of New York
I’m so sick with it, I spit it like cannibal corpse
We be causing a moshpit like Cro-Mags at L'Amours
So who you think this is? Ill Bill, ride and I’m gone
Horrifying like a Time Square suicide bomb
Beyond and beyond, we let the drama start
Terrorize you like freedom fighters
Exploding on the streets of Islamabad
Unapproachable, unfriendly, untouchable
Bulletproof, torture you to death, punish you
Connect heart, react like Colombian death squad
Funded by CIA drug money, possessed by
[Hook x 2]
Legend has it that before I war I worship Satan
Drink human blood and have orgies amongst Masons
Amongst the faces of presidents that crush nations
Stuff a nun, sacred slut, draped in lust and hatred
[Verse 2]
I put the biscuit in your mouth and spit it like System Of A Down
Get your weight up, I’m throwing pistols at the crowd
Now a powerbroker
Non fiction, the future is now over
Prisoners of war tortured by proud soldiers
Tell horror stories, Medal of Honour for war ceremonies
Transport drugs like heavy metal roadies
While they transmit their bullshit through television cameras
Super powers throwing their gang signs like gang bangers
Fuck CNN, fuck Meet the Press, fuck Al Jazeera
Fuck all of y’all, I won’t be brainwashed by the media
Speak it how I live it, powerful lyrics
Leave an entire crowd in hysterics
Popping the four pound when you hear it
I been the worst thing since the CIA trained Bin Laden
The kids ride when I pop off, Crooklyn to Compton
I be the crypt keeper, the Grim Reaper, I spit ether
Guaranteed fatalities, leaving your wig leaking
[Hook x 2]
[Verse 3]
When I die I pray to God that I arrive in Heaven
At least an hour before the Devil know that I’m dead
It’s gonna take more than a single bullet hole to my head
You’re gonna have to nuke the whole Brooklyn borough instead
I trust nobody, question everything, I’m the king
Turn the weak into wolves and the wolves into sheep
Teach you how to kill police then dispose of the heat
My foes throw themselves off of buildings in the throes of defeat
I’m like the Moses of this whole shit
I got bitches that sell blow, blow dick, and suck their own tits
Choking on weed smoke, we squeeze toast
My enemies scream, “No, please don’t!”
Get your whole team soaked
We coked out like Chris Farley the day he died
Survive and your life don’t mean shit if you ain’t even really alive
I walk off backwards with my nines in your faces
While you watch me brainwash your entire generation
[Hook x 2]

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
What up kid?
Been thinking 'bout you doing my bid
After the pigs threw me in jail, 
that was groovy what you did in Hawaii
You were always my favorite of all the girls
Happy you got away and blended back into the world
Remember your old man?
He was far out
Loved the Orange Sunshine
And learned to worship me at 
George Spahn's house
Remember old George named the entire ranch
Squeaky tried to assassinate President Ford, but got nabbed
But you never lied to me, neither did she either
My evil divas
A buncha real eager beavers
You can't fake the realness
The real's never fakeness
Never hate the greatness or ever debate this
Remember Dennis Wilson?
Too bad he drowned
He was there when I put acid in your daddy's mouth
Then I gave you wine
Then I ate your mind
Your trippy hippy, cult leader guy
Made you mine

[Hook]
Holding an M16
Holding an M16
Holding an M16
I’m extreme now
Bullet holes are left in people people
Bullet holes are left in people people
[Verse 1: Steven King]
I feel like this is Ronin, don’t know what’s in this case I’m holding
Is it an M16? Make my heart pump faster, it makes me want to squeeze
It’s the assassinator ?
Rain sparks cause we don’t ask for data
Want a shoulder to lean on? Not mine, head shot
Tripping like Activator
Play the low when I cock it
Stocking mask, we run up in the spot so we don’t get spotted
Red dot, you a target
I see you good like white lint on a black carpet
Bullets went through walls, niggas went to war
I know you’ve never heard it like this before
Come and get me, you gonna come with me
Hold the M16 like I get busy, it’s risky
Gotta move around, gotta keep your wrist strong
Shit you doing something right right? You living this long
So I shoot through the door, send you right to the morgue
That’s how real niggas do, nigga listen to the song
[Hook x 2]
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
I grab the AR-15 updated and upgraded
M16, chop em up then duct tape them fuckfaces
Ice cold, squeeze the toast, leave em froze
Squeeze your toes, drag you into hellfire
Steal your soul, automatic steel explodes
Jesus no, I can see your brains peeking through a bleeding hole
Now your head is like a period, pussy with yeast ?
Discharge seeping low hemoglobin so horrifying and mortifying
The thought is dying and your entire life flash in front of your eyes
My M16 has touched hundreds of lives
Ain’t no silencer, ain’t no fucking surprise
Just fucking die, we buck then fly fucking fried
Let’s splatter this fucking guy
I like the HK416, I like MAC-11s, and Desert Es
But nothing’s like my M16
Night vision scope, grenade launcher, mechanism’s dope
Pick up your M16 and get prepared for the revolt

(intro)
In a country ridden by violence
In a land plagued by gunpire and drug money
One focal figure stands above the rest
Tonight, see why the people of mexico call him
The Narco Saint
(Verse 1:Slaine)
La Coka Nostra
In the midst of the 
Malverde Market
In the presence of the 
Narco saint
The vodka drink bottle smashed and the shotguns aimed
The reaper calling was enough to put 2Pac in paint
Murals of dead heroes, apocalyptic rain
We look above at all the scriptures say
Which is why, which is way
Sniff inside smoke from the biscuit haze
I sniff and daze in the alley where my child dirty
Nursing the stab wounds catching visions of Malverde
I pissed away my life for years, look I'm now 30
Product of pistoleers, rocking a foul jersey
Holding my side together, chopping up perico flakes
Maybe now is my time to head up to that peaceful place
And all I picture is that last Chico's face
I should have seen it coming, those deceitful snakes
What happened after that I cannot say
I saw the face of Jesus, and then I woke up out in Santa Fe
(Ana Kasparian of The Young Turks):
Mexican officials have now detained a 14 year old child assassin
Who's admitted to decapitating 4 people
His sister's also detained because she is err..
Basically admitting to dumping the bodies on freeway and rivers
Doing whatever's necessary to get rid of the decapitated bodies
(Verse 2: Ill Bill)
In the midst of Malverde's darkness
In the presence of the narco saint
La coka nostra tagged on the walls of the house of pain
The reaper calling was enough to leave your house in flames
Tattoos of deceased idols, so killers sound the same
We look above it on the witness face
Jury with a bitter taste in their mouths
Division in the distant haze, The pistol plays like hellfire
Bullets whistle by like voices beyond the grave in the dead choir
I pissed away my life for many moons
Many shitty wombs in pissy motels
Exchanging bricks with many goons
Exchanging bullet wounds with many fools
I'm one of the most fortunate though, I've been torturing impending doom
And all I picture is when me and God talk
Looking like Tim Roth from the ending of Reservoir Dogs
What happened after that I can't tell you
But if you keep the faith then even death can't fail you
(Outro)
Its the latest gruesome discovery in a wave of violence
That's crippled this Mexican border city
Bodies of 9 decapitated men where found in a vacant empty lot
In this poor Tijuana neighborhood, just miles from San Diego
California state police said the heads were discovered in plastic bags near the bodies
3 of the men have been identified as police officers
Their ID cards were found in their mouths
Official says drug turf battles where the center of much of the violence here
Claiming at least 37 lives over 3 days, 4 of them children

El Gant, Ill Bill
Yeah, ?
It officially starts now
El Gant and Ill Bill, ha
[Verse 1: El Gant]
I’m giving you something you’ve never seen
Listen close, this is not a dream
Wake up from surgery, feel the doctor poke at your spleen
I’m from a place cause a racist cop will choke out a teen
Then leave him slumped in the street and beaten
That’s how it seems
Yo, what the fuck you mean? This life ain’t natural
Don’t make touch on government, the streets are like the capital
And Christianity is magical, they make you think
That you cannot finish a date without smoking, I’ll take a drink
This is not a story, some think it’s all a game
Most of us sold to the Devil just for a taste of fame
And so they pull something heavy, metal splatter your brain
It’s not a game when you watch a pistol shatter your frame
It’s pain and pleasure, you mix a little together
Then let it rise to the top and then popping, you get the measure
The president is a veteran sodomizing his people
To make you believe the words that he’s speaking
Naturally evil
[Hook]
This is that heavy metal shit
Don’t even meddle with
I keep a four just in case yo I gotta settle shit
You ain’t a veteran, I got some medicine
Don’t even act like you’re tough, homie
You’re better then
And this ain’t for the radio, don’t even play it, ho
The metal music to lose it, you know it’s crazy yo
And this is how it’s going down, let off a hundred rounds
Of metal music now can you hear the sound?
[Ill Bill]
I’m giving you 
heroin for your ears
Listen close, homie. This is dope
Get your adrenaline pumping like you was sniffing coke
Ride the lightning, 
cult leader my mind’s frightening
I drink blood from a human skull like a Viking
To toast the death of my enemies
I command an army of blood thirsty murderers with heads like machines
I’m the future of this piece of shit scene
Abandon all hope and these fake fucking faggots
I’mma snatch up all their bling
Got you stuck in the moment, zoning 
advanced but fucked up like cloning
I’m the evolution of super soldiers
Human vultures, better yet I’m exploding like super novas
Moving in circles of 
tyrannical goons with toasters
The face of the Devil, chased by the bass and the treble
The gunfight erupts amongst fallen saints in the temple
This is Ill Bill making the metal bang like Slip Knot
With twin Glocks, thirty-six shots, you get your wig popped
[Hook]
It officially starts, the takeover, the takeover
> > Lyrics posted by heroin4yourears < <

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
The chariots of Satan, bare skin, black horses, and swords
Blood thirsty dogs of war with big revolvers galore
We from Glenwood projects with egos the size of cathedrals
Goon flicks, white dudes with afros that's wild like Knievel
Don't eat the brown acid, she devils in bellbottoms dancing
Hippie bitches surround Manson, underground anthems
Of mainstream massacre Sharon Tate stomach lacerator
Fetus remover
, dripping like Eazy E's activator
Like Mitch Green, my words of intrigue are sharp enough to make
Your wrist bleed; that make even the hottest bitch fiend
And blow dick;
 we so sick, we holding control of your whole life
In a chrome clip, I blow up your whole shit
We the most focused here, like Mark Storace from Krokus
You're over with, hit you with flying exploding fists
My flying guillotines and razors hoping you quit
Draining what's left of your soul, till you no longer exist
[Hook: Necro] x2
Gangster guitars, 70s dust shit, pump this!
Stick a needle in, catch a fix, sacophone and trumpet
Bop to the ride, Fender Rhodes Suicide
[Verse 2: Goretex]
I'm at your funeral, doing bong hits with Iommi
I'm smoked out, zonked, like chrome, till my eyes are all foamy
El Camino with the dubs
 [?] plates for the homies
Dark throne holding it down, I spit a round for the cronies
I'm the king of the park, with the booze and bombs taped to my suit
[?] a violent femme, a pussy still unable to douche
All these oxys got me hopped up on making the shoot
What I do to your face, you make it seem [?] is the truth
This is my war like Black Flag's,
 
zipped up in the black bags
Pissing on models pussies, 
just look at what the cat dragged
Pentagram behind her ear, big tits with a little sag
Young wizard rocking the hand of doom with a little [?]
My project [?] with masks in the paper bags
Buck-fifty turkey and swiss, two for you and your man
Prime deli, oozing out your skull like jelly
My goons are a threat to the world, we bury you in your Bently
[Hook: Necro] x2

[Intro: 
Uncle Howie
]
My life is- I'm dependent, I can't help it. I 
started at a young age
I'm too dependent on it, you know?
Drugs and music get me where I wanna go now
But I gotta make the money for it and it's not that easy nowadays
[Hook]
My uncle shoots heroin, my father used to do cocaine
My moms used to smoke weed with her friends when I was eight
Smoked weed when I was twelve, sold weed at fourteen
Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
Conscious rap is bullshit, 
gangster rap is a fraud
This is real rap, bang your fucking head through the wall
This is drug music, 
stuck with a syringe in your arm
I'm the truth like the name of the song
Yo my uncle shoots heroin
[Ill Bill]
Bathroom floor, found a syringe
When I was on the Hydro Tour Howie went out on a binge
The snake bitch I was fucking even took him to cop
A month later he was on the floor looking for rock
Missed a flight to Czech Republic, walked in the path
Of Howie lying in his own puke dying from crack
Cocaine poisoning, he shot the heroin since fourteen
February 2003, he was clean
I helped him out, he kicked crack, dope, and meth
Hosted shows, free clothes, bubblebaths, autographs
T-shirts,
 
soon I'mma make a Howie action figure
Before his latest relapse I'm glad I captured pictures
I love Howie, homie used to change my diapers
To save him I'd have jumped in front of spray from snipers
But this is just something that he's gotta do on his own
I try to get through to him with this song yo
[Hook]
[Ill Bill]
He used to live in my crib, 
sleep on my couch smoking Newport 100's
Gave me comic books, bought me my first bass guitar
Learned from my grandma how to tell you the future with cards
Watch the sci-fi channel high off of methadone
More addictive than anything injected in the arm
D.T.'s five in the morning waking my moms
Got a search warrant but Howie Tenenbaum is gone
Roaming the streets, he was a superhero to me
When I was five I used to pick the seeds out of his weed
Nodding out, burning cigarette holes in his sheets
Wake up and eat 
a box of Captain Crunch
 then go back to sleep
He was a crackhead too, he might still be
A walking relapse, that motherfucker's still on the street
You tell him right he goes left
Show him right he does wrong
I hope I get through to him with this song yo
[Hook]

[Intro: Uncle Howie]
When you can smoke it too you can mix
Heroin with crack and smoke it, same thing as coke
And it's, 
it's called chasing the dragon
Almost the same thing, y'know
Cause it hits you that quick
[Ill Bill]
Coka mythology, murder world, Uncle Howie in the big park
The other kids knew the shit that he sparked
Crack is the new shit on the block, they pitched and he copped
Lost his mind, got high as fuck and lit up the spot
So when I caught him smokin crack in my crib, I kicked him out
Almost kicked his ass but then I decided not to for what?
Then he bounced with a tear in his eye
I remember thinkin the next time I see his face I hope he's alive
So lost in the excitement, no shame
Fuck society's indictments and fuck you too, if you don't like it
That's his attitude, that's his outlook
In and out of Rikers Island all throughout my childhood, a wild dude
I've done every drug you can name, except dope and crack cocaine
I gotta thank Uncle Howie for that
After seein what he did to his life I stepped back
Thank God I never got caught up or went back
But, weed is still a problem, I'm hooked on kush
Hooked on chronic, rollin up the purple in the blunt
I'm Chinese in the eyes Lebanese with the nines
American with the rhymes Brooklyn 'til I die
[Hook: Sick Jacken] *
Esto son corridos de los mas idos, los mas locos
Y son pocos, lo que no estan torcidos
A los narcos borrachos y cocodrilos
No escogimos la vida simplemente fuimos nacidos
Se que la vida es dura y siempre esta la duda
Yo sigo siendo quien soy hasta que deje viuda
[Translation] *
This are among the more hardcore corridos, the craziest
And there are few that arent corrupted
By drunk﻿ drug dealers and cocaine junkies
We didn't choose to live, simply, we were born
I know that life is hard, and there's always doubt
I'm gonna keep being myself 'til my wife is a widow
[Sick Jacken]
He was a Mexican, first generation, the kid was 10
Used to play tools and mix booze for pop and his friends
A mixmaster, yeah the kid was nice with the blends
Just ice with two Cokes, a Super Socko with gin
The streets saw a future narco in him
He saw his father's bad habits and went to cycle followin them
The bottle and the women and sin
And the domestic violence, the silence of the music when it begins
The alcohol was a part of his life, bigger than Christ
Cause when he needed to cope, he turned to the vice
From a teen pregnancy to when his brother died twice
He kept rollin the dice under the influenced rice
He went from this close to killin himself, to barely dodgin death
The scent of some liquor probably taint his last breath
I feel less sympathy as time pass
The more I see his reflection every time I look in the glass
[Hook]
[Uncle Howie]
Oh God
The pack lasted like an hour, heh
(What that's the whole pack?)
There's no cigarettes in it
(Well how many cigarettes did you smoke out?
Were you chain smokin 'em?)
Nah I was sharin it
(Oh well we can get more)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Necro]
Dirty deeds get done dirt cheap for 2Gs
Blades inserted deep in your throat, murdered in your sleep
Rock you like a hurricane, a berzerk fighter
Old school like Dirkschneider, pants tighter than a vagina
I used to rock Northface and polos
Puffing a spliff in the PJs, bumping Cliff Burton bass solos
Rugged like Dickinson on Trooper
 [?]
Demons to get you, Diamond, Simmons, and Cooper
You're homosexual on some Marilyn shit
The plan is to damage you like Vinnie [?] on the kit
You'll get beat up, all of human destiny's fucked
I love metal, rep it to Death, rest in peace Chuck
The Final Countdown, lots of depression
Your beats are weak, your clique is flotsam and jetsam
I'm like Skolnick, doing arpeggios that saw through your head
Piggy, you'll live forever like the back [?]
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
We raise up, like bullets out of arrows
Like kings and pharaohs, live in the shadows
We the poison in the tip of an assassin's arrow
Your demise will be the death of an asshole
Of a fucking douchebag, you're the perfect example
Get murdered and trampled, stomped into the dirt
Anybody makes a move, and everybody gets hurt
I'm like gamma radiation; 
reputation's the cornerstone of respect
Disrespect, I'll put a fucking hole in your dome or your chest
Coke is the best, it'll make you more money than Jesus
And turn your heart colder than ice that's up in your freezer
I'm like Mao Zedong and Joe Stalin, exploding violence
Suck my dick on a throne [?] and diamonds
Have my own people destroyed, raped, and shredded
A combination of Ho Chi Minh, Hussein, and Lenin
The Circle of Supertyrants in a race for weapons
Pay for your love and you always shall remain a legend
[Verse 3: Goretex]
Into the void, I stab you till your skin is destroyed
[?]
Goretex [?] flesh and gore
[?] I'm a drifter, I shall be reborn
Feast on the carcass, I'm like Bill [?]
From the projects, strong to the morgue dog
I'm like acid, I kill fear
Cause of destiny, caught with your face splattered
Incision mechanic, Travis Bickle sick with a magnum
The addict for killing, my works all displayed in the city
Kabala appetite, initiation burns on their titty
I'm like the mad scholar, cutting through chicks is groovy
Fuck with the goons, pump .22 in your kufi
Young [?] handing over doses to groupies
Mind control with a cloak like a flash from a bad movie
Loose edits, during credits, it's just me and the Uzi
Executioner, hang those fuckers in shacks in the boonies

[Verse 1: Necro]
Before ligaments and fridges
The triple six digits religion
Might sacrifice pigeon's fidget
Was created by ancient midgets
My kamikaze cronies
Listen to 
Ozzy
 over Rick Rock's chords
Doing quasi religious ceremonies
I see with the owl see
Curse you into paralysis
Drinking blood from the chalice with 
Alistair Crowley
I feel no guilt, for the blood that got spilt
Fuck thou shall not kill, do what thou wilt!
Scheming on Rosemary's baby in witches shrine
My cult'll leave you shocked like Polanski in 69
Introduce you to hallucinogenic narcotics
Baiting you with females rocking psychodelic bell bottoms
Fu-Manchu in effect
Bending spoons like Uri Geller
Then I'll sharpen the ends
And jooks you in the neck
67 stab wounds in the LaBiancas
Allows you to sip droplets from the goblets of Pompous conquerers
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Table and dagger
Altar of death
Virgins with big breasts
Soldiers of morbid thoughts
Nuns indulging in incest
Bring me the 
goat
, manipulating women on dope
Kidnap the pope
Hang from the rope
And stabbed in the throat
I'll spill your blood in the name of Satan
And capture your soul
Author of sacrifice, use the bible to bash in your skull
Master within your cult
Authors of madness
Step into my chapel of goons
My collection of scalpels and tools
Are used for ritualistic and sadistic purposes
Ceremonial deaths
Serpent the ancient verses
Pazuzu possesses a sister
Masturbating in the monastery
She used the crucifix to pop her cherry
Perverted priest, flirt with the deceased
The 
Black Mass
 is achieved
Shadowy figures joyfully dance with the beast
Hunger for human flesh, is sex to cannibal's feast
Head of the jackal, six figure hand is complete
[Verse 3: Goretex]
20 hits and the room melts
Get those with the black acid
Kidnapping your wife
Tape suppositories in plastic
Candle smashing areolas
Cold as a bastard
Torn from a casket
Human flesh gets scorned to ashes
Pray to Satan like Jimmy Page
Take a stage of blood
Covered the following
Bloods led by Miss Sadie Glutz
The yalo drive, from up in the hills
Californication of pills
Triple six engraved in your fucking gills
We're [?] wifey
Made eat the whole cake
Worship a ghost state
Puncture your throat like chunks of Colgate
Lunch in the crate
And cutting his [?] in the first [?]
The surgeon of hate
I'm licensed to keep my nurses okay
Unwrapping the vague
Kevorkian, with dust in the J
Hell awaits pussies the podium
Molest your remains
I'm like Brian Wilson, the genius, with a stain of crimson
Original, delusional
Goons, we move through the system
[Verse 4: Mr.Hyde]
Enter the master witchdoctor
Evil emperor of my chance
Will anoint the dead
And poison heads
And brainwash a chant
I envision baptism
With satanic mechanisms
Each exorcism, reads the deep flesh incisions
My system of worship
Features bitches in skirts
I strip and purify my prey
Before they are viciously merked
We're known to impregnate, corrupt the average slut
Stab the gut and quickly sent the miscarriage from cups
Hide the leader of ascension
Along with evil henchman
Puking down your throat, because your soul needed cleansing
Blood painted pentagrams
Engulfed by flames
Charcoal chunks of frames
We feast on monkey brains
Calmly cut you down your spine
Now we're chugging blood of wine
Choke and suffocate with twine
The fucking suffering is divine
While tranquilizing needles get stuck up in your arm
Sacrificial animals get abducted from the farm

[Hook]
Come on, with me
[Verse 1: Slaine]
They say this story is a myth and they bore my with they if's
They can never understand me, notorious is is
A fighter fallen deep into the warriors abyss
I got a mixed up past, it warrants me to flip
I got my dick sucked fast, in the sixth grade from a bitch
With a switchblade who used to twist up grass
She never learned nothing cuz' the bitch cut class
I never learned nothing either, but puffin reefer and stuffing beaver
I grew into a sick fuck fast
An unstable addle
My dumb neighbors taddle
Cops knocking on the door, I do my thing no hassle
I'm saying I ain't playing
I am the king of this castle
The casa of the asshole
The cash when you passcode
You little local rappers back off, I'm international
Stamps in my passport
Billboards in Moscow
Phone ringing off the hook
I can't answer it, not now
[Hook]
Come on, with me
[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
So they told me, they never disown me and I believed it
The gold oakley lenses reflecin' and deceivin'
Chicken shit, fucking pussy, asshole
If not for me, you wouldn't even have a cash flow
Never held a gun but you blast though
Haha stupid
I'm in there getting money
You in there playing cupid
I'm coming through in a coupe without the roof in
Bitch by my side with the ass strictly for boofing
Enough of that though, never judge a book off a first look
Just a cook off the first tote
If its right then you sell it, get a good boat
And if ya lucky, get a shorty with a wood throat
No yeast, you fucking with the three beasts
Deca Durabolin shooting three CC's
Get off the wenis, make her kiss the rim
Sour intravenous, piss away the sin
[Hook]
Come on, with me
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Yo, they say this story is a myth
But I'm gloriously sick, Ill Bill, I'm like a walking emporium of piff
I abacinate, poke you in the cornea with spliffs
I assassinate, smoke you and your shorty with the fifth
I will lacerate, cut you up and throw you in the car trunk
Ask who's great, you could be the last thing these maggots taste
Tie your feet and hands with tape, dead rats stuffed up in ya' mouth
Lock you in the casket, now you can't escape
Homie you a bitch, throw you in the ditch
Smother you in dirt, with the worms, now you don't exist
Murder is my favorite thing, body everything
Pull out the chopper like Harley Davidson and start spraying things
We La Coka Nostra, gun jam, beat you with the broken toaster
Leave you in the dumpster in the back of Roll-N-Roaster
On Emmons Avenue, splatter you, 
having you crying to Zeus like Olivia New, Xanadu
[Hook]
Come on, with me, set your self free
Let the music take you away

[Hook]
One for the butcher knife, two for the Glock!
(You can't kill me, cause I'm already dead)
[Necro]
Peep my little friend his name is M one six
I got the butcher, knife, to cut your fuckin' heart out for kicks
I'm on a killing spree, like a nigga named Manson
Write a rhyme on your grave kid, it's where I'll be dancin'
The cha cha, you try to flex and I shot ya
Ten to the head, and now you're motherfuckin' brain dead
Mad moonies need mad clips
I got more rubber in my Glock than artificial hips
So now you're dead kid
Cause you fuckin bled kid
Every time I shot you in your motherfuckin' head kid
When you call my suicidal hotline
I'll tell you to blow your fuckin' brains out with a tek-9
Blowin off your lips is somethin I promote
So light up an M-80 and shove it down your fuckin' throat
The rougher, the more you suffer, I'm the messiah
My rhymes are thicker, than the afro on Richard Pryer
So fuck, fuck fuck fuck
If you step to the corpse than your goin' to catch a buck
You stupid fuck
Check out the way to beat grooves
They call me horny, cause I fuck anything that moves
My fucked up rhymes are sure to offend ya
So I'll drive over your body like the niggas from toxic avenger
Rip out your brain through your nose
And when a girl comes over I got a whole selection of dildos
So die motherfucker die
And don't ask me why punks get bruised up like Soleil Moonfry
I rock a house party like Molile
And I fucked a dead corpse to techno, cause I'm a necrophile
So if you're warm ca-ca, get with this
If not i'll bust out my dick, and piss in your esophagus
I drank a blood donor's deposit
Now Moony's out like a fagget that just came out of the fuckin' closet
[Hook]
One for the butcher knife, two for the Glock!
(You can't kill me, cause I'm already dead)
[Goretex]
Check one, two, I got clout like a mortician
I got more fresh body parts than Dahmer's kitchen
A lime to a lemon, a lemon to a lime
I rock a dead nigga skin every time I drop my rhyme
The storm troopers in death gear, that's how it flows
No one knows, I want your money and your clothes
I stink like sex, I rob bitches welfare checks
And I rob more cribs than Malcolm X
Yes it's the butcher with more Dick than Clark
I love to bash bitches on the head in central park
Position, sicko, infamous junkie
A tek-9 connected to my spine shows I'm funky
The fridge is filled with fresh killed body parts
The niggas who dissed me, the bitches who broke my heart
Now I'm mista murder
The dildo inserter
Baptized in blood I'm the celebate converter
Ain't misbehaven
Sick like Wes Craven
I'll open your mom's legs, vagina's unshaven
Bitin' the heads off Glocks like Ozzy Osbourne
Dead celebrities, with the Children of the Corn
The butcher block Glock rock scream until you die
Goretex put me in the chair till I fry
[Hook]
One for the butcher knife, two for the Glock!
(You can't kill me, cause I'm already dead)
[Ill Bill]
The official distorted body parts chop-a-chops your body
Piece by mothafuckin' piece
Then I study the anatomical breakdown of the human physique
The blood suckin freaks
 speaks then you drop the sea
Need I say more? Maybe I do these days
I be grabbin up my Glock whenever me and my crew
Step into a nigga pullin' the trigger in this area
Territories all occupied by hysteria
And it gets scarier by the minute
Cause I got niggas screamin' just like a bitch at the abortion clinic
Damned if I do, damned if I don't
I'll fuck a pregnant bitch up her ass after I slit her throat
And throw her body off of the roof top
Chop chop, then drop pieces, dead celebrities releases
The mostess grossest, sicker than multiple cirrhoses
Mumbo jumbo, even your brain's hopeless
Cause there's no hope when the camouflage is comin' at ya to get ya
Food faced mask and two boots, the fracture
Your fucking face takes my size twelve
Mr. Ill Bill is coming straight from hell
To fuck up a felon no turning back, my gat crack
With hollow tips my tek rips then flips my stack, a fuckin rap
After the blood spoke I smoke another
After I step up your pops I fuck your mother
Yeah, I'll hit the fuckin' puss with my penis
More fractured a chump drop adidas when my meat hits
Between, butt cheeks, titties, and cock lips
My cock sticks gross
After my jizm jumps 
that's all she wrote
Cause I'm fuckin detected from the puss to my rectum
Eye sockets to ear drums a deviated septum
Pull out the Glock shoot the bitch with my Glock
Collect my props, then Bill's out like acid rock
[Hook]
One for the butcher knife, two for the Glock!
(You can't kill me, cause I'm already dead)

[Verse 1: Necro]
My religious beliefs are to kill snitches and any 
bitches that beef
Your grill in stitches, 
get buried inside a ditch in your briefs
Life is enslavement and suffering, crazy snuffings, attacks
Overdosing like 
David Ruffin
, craving, puffing some crack
Hell is endless and friendless to the 
Hitlers
, 
Mengeles
, and 
Himmlers
Mangled, ripped to pieces by characters like 
Pinhead
, no forgiveness
Reincarnated as God and Satan, 
logical psycho
 sadist
My cadence hits like razorblade tips 
of invader invaded
Corresponding with demons, 
bonded in blood
Like the 
Ugandan president Idi
 
genocide like Rwandans in bondage
Divine comedy
, mind lobotomy, 
do the math like Ptolemy
A bloodbath, 
you're split in half, dichotomy
The honorable, horrible, incorrigible, adorable death oracle
Beautiful like a funeral floral, you heard the stories: Murdering for glory
Sent to 
purgatory
 for doing something perverted and gory
[Hook: Everlast]
When your heart won't beat, your eyes go black
There's a light in the tunnel and you can't turn back
Your friends can't save you, your family's gone
You're waiting on your judgment at the foot of the throne
Will you beg for some mercy? Will you cop some pleas?
Will you stand on your own or get down on your knees?
Will your angels release you from where demons dwell?
Will you make it into Heaven or go right back to Hell?
Only time will tell, only time will tell
Only time will tell, only time will tell
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
I fall upon my knees like, "Lord forgive me"
Out of the commandments I've broken ten out of ten now
Blasphemy passed to me because now Satan's my pen pal
Part of me Asmodeus
, 
the other side is an evangelist
God gave me melodious but I'm sick, psycho, and scandalous
Outbursts like 
bismillah
, 
hallelujah
On the other hand 
I lust for flesh
 
in my quest for gouda
Shaboobalaboopy
 time, I choose and the coochie's mine
My booze through the nine and I ooze at a groupie dime
I threw B-signs
, 
but the Cs got more patnas
Everything dead, blasting at peep ma poor 
patois
Trying to bring you peace but the beast brings forth 
kaka
I really feel like I hate you but it's 
eep opp ork ah-ah
You don't know what that means? Then ask Jet Screamer
Trash that lingers will cause the enemies to blast that femur
Only time will tell if I 
crash between her
God forgive me, I'm torn because I'm an angel
With a
 
crass demeanor
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
For whom the bells toll
, it's the clock, tick tick tick
The truth is 
the future is now
How many lifetimes have I taken you through in this hour?
I trust nobody cause 
Babylon
 
destroyed my uncle
So many lessons I've applied to my life that taught me to function
In this hell on the earth the 
dark clouds have silver linings
Until the lightning strikes down upon the unrighteous and frightening
The non-believers like eighty year old atheists on their death bed
Crying and begging for forgiveness from God
Atrocities committed against mankind
Monstrosities that span time leaving impressions of hatred in man's mind
Don’t let time trap you, it’s vital that you realize that there's a new beginning
At the ending of the hour of reprisal

[Verse 1: Possessed]
Lock your doors 
I’m rotten to the horror core
Valkyries clean up after my dogs of war
Won’t be pigeon-holed I’m a bird of prey
Put me a category I’ll put you in a early grave
Lucifer reject
Shoulders are stumps from where I used to have three heads
(Possessed) there can only be one
Before my soul reach hell, scatter my ashes over the sun
Not holding my tongue, I say what I feel
I’m the hand that rocks the cradle of filth
I don’t wanna live life
The suicidal sword swallower, slitting my throat from the inside
Open my windpipe
Corpses rise from the grave when my names spoken at midnight
Inflict indescribable pain
Don’t drink drive, drink Strychnine and pilot a plane
[Verse 2: DarkStar]
Down for survival, left at the ‘Hour of Reprisal’
My verse coerce worse than the power of the Bible
The g
ame changed I stay raw
Spitting chainsaws configuring bars like I
’m rigging Claymores
We ain’t singing or dancing
Kids in my camp is a fam more satanic than Manson
American, my partner in Canada lampin’
Watch your eye contact or get slammed with the hammer for glancing
The Last be a savage beast
Any rapper in the path of me is actually a casualty
Have pity for cats that have to battle me
Cause catastrophe, naturally never will my disaster cease
I dispatch beef Frank Castley
Ninety nine and a half percent of rap is ass to me [Y’all Suck]
Psiklone Possessed Skirmish & Billy Idol
Plus Last conceal rifles spill ya vitals
[Verse 3: Psiklone]
I keep my eyes peeled with hunting knives
My voice alone provokes stone gargoyles to come to life
Gave nightmares spitting Lucifer lullabies
Tried a hundred times but can't seem to fucking die
Run and hide
When disaster strikes, the whole worlds looking at me like Busta Rhymes
Turn the London eye colour blind
Muscles thrive off natural steroids in my blood supply
Psiklone a sick psycho
Drink and spit nitro and sprint so quick I switch time zones
Bury my landlords under the floor
When lightning strikes I hit back with double the force
Death sentences riddled with wise words
Like the titanic you've only touched the tip of the ice berg
Grab minotaurs by the horns
I’m a higher force and I learnt to fly before I could walk
[Verse 4: Skirmish]
Break your bones with built in brass knuckles
N.O.S cylinders inside my legs as calf muscles
Sprint against an avalanche
Souls expire, exposed to the smokeless fir of this dragon’s wrath
Tarot cards, dealt death in every pack
Thought in my mind racing completing memory lapse
Would suffocate to death if I swallowed my pride
My heart attacks in battles between body and mind
The earth rumbles and quakes at my coming of age
An appetite for destruction stepping up to the plate
(My) Skins senseless to cigarette burns
Coz I’m charged on an overdose of Nilapat herbs
(Inhale) I love the smell of death in the air
In the midst of war holding my severed head by the hair
I’m never level headed, an unbalanced mind
That sent my pulsating heart and dead roses to my valentine
[Verse 5: Ill Bill]
A cannibalistic orgy of words born to torture the earth
Thought’s are berserk, cauldron’s will burst
The bubble, cursed for trouble danger misfortune
My words resemble the strangeness of Chris Walken
We just talking, conversations with God
Shout at the devil thousands of rebel martyrs assemble
Under a black flag with the white skull and guns on it
Drink vodka straight out of the bottle and puff chronic
Better yet catch me with Snoop drinking Tanqueray
Listening to Cuban Linx 2 in the lab with Rae
“The Hour of Reprisal” gave me cash and fame
Next stop homie - you’ll catch me in the lab with Dre
I had Premo on my album; had Muggs on my album
Had models from Brazil chopping up drugs on my album
This is Ill Billy Crystal, the kid with the frown
Spitting it loud get outta my way I’ma piss in the crowd

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
He was the middle son of three children, lived in my building
He went to Tildon
, quiet cat, always kept to himself
He never chilled with anybody but his girlfriend, drove an ‘82 Whirlwind
Homie’s grades in school was perfect
Honour student with a talent for mathematics
Used to design computer graphics in class instead of doodling
I would write rhymes, smoke blunts on the bench at night time
While he was doing his homework and watching Nightline
Looking over 
MIT brochures
,
Invitations to the Pentagon from headhunters of course
I heard that 
NASA
 was inquiring about his status
He was about to be a rookie in the NBA of mathematics
A rock star amongst astronauts, first round draft pick
Amongst physicists and cancer doctors
Then the CIA recruited him to be a shooter
I set him up so that Diabolic could shoot him
We planned assassination plots, lasers attached to gats that pop
Finely glued to the top of the barrel, the average shot
Could take two people’s heads off simultaneously
Aiming at cranium spraying them in the coffin displaying them
This that shoot you in the face movement
Bill and Diabolic is like 
Schwarzenegger and Stallone
 in the same movie
I’m like Bronson in the Violent City
Freedom fighter like Mumia, kill cops in Philly, listen
[Interlude: Joker (Heath Ledger/The Dark Knight)]
Introduce a little anarchy. Upset the established order and everything becomes chaos
I’m an agent of chaos.
 
Oh, and you know the thing about chaos?
It’s fear
[Verse 2: Diabolic]
It was a quarter past eight o’clock
Bill called me and he named the spot
This vacant lot around the way from the bagel shop
He schooled me to exactly how the CIA would plot
To make hip hop’s value nothing more than a Jacob watch
Illustrated by what’s built with ancient blocks
And the all-seeing eye through Jay’s hand that portrays the Roc
Not to worry, I had Engineer pay the cops
So they would not respond to the calls about a fatal shot
I later topped this roof viewing through a sniper scope
What I like to call a future murder scene with righteous hope
About to light a smoke when two headlights approached
Rifle smoke strikes when they touch ground like lightning bolts
Twice the volts in the same spot amazingly
It’s two birds, one stone, met his partner from the agency
Was ex-KGB, defected through the State Department
Wanted by authorities for treason, he’s been made a target
Took my position with this loaded rifle, aimed and sparked it
A single shot killed them both
, blood stained their garments
Guess all the CIA and NASA training ain't matter
When his brains splattered on the pavement as his face shattered
The day after is used to cover tracks and lock the fortress
Shot our sources and disposed of all their rotting corpses
I know it’s stunning, we ain’t running like some track stars
We chill with bodies buried in 
Uncle Howie’s
 backyard
[Outro: Joker (Heath Ledger/The Dark Knight)]

[Intro: Necro]
Yo...
Don't make me flip on you
Actually you can't make me do nothing
I might decide to
[Verse 1: Necro]
I used to mush thugs
And now I push drugs
I knew a kid that put slugs in his own mug
Used to show me his guns
Ain't a cat that knows me as son
Remember violence at only one
I used to watch how my Pops would treat a girl
And beef with the world
He had a bone to pick
That's why my dome was sick
It rubbed off on me
Because the apple don't fall far from the tree g
You cats keep your distance
Cause your scared I might flip in an instant
When I was filled with innocence
I was still committing sins
Half of you cats are sweet like cinnamon
I shove a knife in your grin
I run with convicts who stick up kids
That'll rob you for six bucks bitch
We flip right before you expect it
Because we were neglected, as children now we're hectic
We shot men and we rob gems
I seen cats that used to clock me, now I clock them
Got easier access to a Glock-10
In case, one in ya face is the only option
[Hook x2]
Necro with Ill Bill
Walk around like - 
murder, murder, kill, kill
Gun up in your grill
And you screaming 'Chill! Chill!'
Didn't have your steel, now you get your cap peeled
This is our life, our life
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Ayo, I grew up in the motherfucking projects
My moms says if my pop left
We would have to get a section-8 apartment
The rest cheap, I see decepticons at
 least
Ten deep, run up on me flipping, wanna set beef
That was some faggot shit, me and my brother
Went for do-lo
The only 2 white kids up in my projects that wasn't homo
I fought every day, beefed with a hundred cats
Way before I started sold drugs and busting caps
Way before I bust my first nut, I love to rap
At 10 years old is when I first started to fuck with that
Everyone else in my PJ's knew I was black
I kept it to myself, continued to define my craft
I used to buy my mother milk dragging a spike bat
You fought with me, I was the type of cat to fight back
I lace you with a broken nose, holding the ice pack
Wife black, Puerto Rican's, we was poor, it was wack
My mom's tried her best
I never graduated high school I learned to pump drugs and pack 9's instead
Became one of those violent heads
Have you on a respirator, even though the doctor know your mind is dead
[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
I make ruthless records consecutive
Disconnect your wig, wet you in your living room
Disrespect your crib, spit fire at you
Pop pop, cause your body to ooze
Bill, anything I spit's uncle Howie approved
There ain't no justice and there ain't no peace
These mean streets are like the evil dead eager to feast
Soul chasers will leave you diseased, what you get dealing with creeps
People sleep until we cause the desert eagles to speak
There's no love and no loyalty left
Learn ya lesson, the hood shot rich porter to death
Only the hood die young, rest in peace to Jam Masta Jay
Biggie and Pac, and all the rest who passed away
I'm like an animal, trying to survive
Striving for a better tomorrow, the world's full of terror and sorrow
Tears drop from a little baby boy or girl
While the push of a button could destroy the world
[Hook X2]
It's a overkill, no escaping this we raping this homie
It's a overkill, expose to nuclear radiation
It's a overkill, push the chromosone chromosplode
It's a overkill, peep the overfiend overload
[Verse 2]
Hit you with the nine shell in your head like Kleinfeld
My mind's swelled, I laugh at it like Seinfeld or Larry David
Then blast off like Larry Davis
We carry bangers and air you out like airplane hangers
I rock 5 star general status, projects to Paris
At the Hilton sticking foreign objects in Paris
I'm very paranoid tell me what they asked you? Splash you
Nuke you like fast food, splatter you when I clap tools
I keep it simple like grass roots, attack troops
Ghetto gorillas in track suits, wet up your whole shit like a bathroom
I catch fools slipping and hit 'em with capsules of blow cause cash rules
The truth newport carton junkies and street trash, wheat grass
Customers cop hundreds of weed bags
Yeah I was chosen to kill those who are smoking the krills
Sold it to you out the old seville, yo you know the drill
[Hook X2]
[Verse 3]
Go overboard, this is Ill Bill the overlord, go to war
I approach you with a trojan horse, entire armies are slaughtered
Explosions of gore, soldiers fall, hot enough to cause your bones to dissolve
Go through walls, Let the don use it, mix it with orange juice and abuse it
Throw your guns in the air and lose it, gangstas and goons with uzis
We underhanded money, rubberbanded the son of sam, son of man
People too stupid to understand, I'm the host with the most
Travel coast to coast, rolling like nostra coke, when I post the toast
Leave you wetter than PCP dispose of folks, loced out leave you with holes
Your clothes are soaked, you fucking shithead your thought process is idiotic
It gets worse blow a hole in your head, leave you retarded, look at you know
Stupid fuck see what you started, I won't stop till all of are dearly departed
[Hook X2]

Disastrous appetite
The last massacre fantastica ambassador
My castle’s like Vlad Dracula’s
Bath in blood, blast the snub
Plastic gloves, 
laugh at love
My heart is pitch black
Like a panther cub or a cancer lung
Call me acid tongue
Hit hard like Black Sabbath drums
Like an assassin does
Big silencers and massive guns
Cooked in the mind, the first to blast and the last to run
Look in my eyes, you'd think that Manson had a bastard son
Cast aside after dancing out a rancid cunt
Tabs and lines got me ranting, and trashed inside a trance on drugs
I shovel snow up to my dome until my hands are numb
Bundles of dope I know my uncle would be amped to touch
A smorgasbord of enormous whores and trashy sluts
Nasty ass & jugs happily jack me till I’m blasting cum
And stay swerving into murder and perversion
Urgent when we're inserting lysergics in the virgin
Cadaveric maverick savages ravage the average
Evangelist family to famished cannibal sandwiches
Edible funerals, turn terrible to beautiful
Sever dudes for food, several medical tools are suitable
Trouble times - some will live, some will die
Chewed out in a tomb, found mummified
Shoot-outs in the summertime
Bubble crime, devil might drive-by
Genocide 
cenobite
,
Rebels strike hard like a metal pipe
Bark like a kennel fight
Sharp like a venom bite
Dark like an ocean filled with sharks in the dead of night
Levitate and write, everything God said to Christ
Hell Awaits
 like 
Kerry King rocking metal spikes
Like Paul Baloff at studio 54 live
"Ultimate Revenge Tour" VHS, all time greatest
Spray death here - shoot the llama from the elbow
Like James Hetfield produced the Piranha demo

[Verse 1]
I'm the Kreator of Terrible Certainty, it's No Escape from the Toxic Trace
Pop your face, Storming With Menace and Blind Faith
The Angel of Death Read Between the Lies South Of Heaven
Expendable Youth, Divine Intervention
Teaching y'all A Lesson In Violence
Doctor Death injecting the virus, apocalypse
I'm a horseman in the Circle Of Tyrants
And death's the era, 
Posessed like Jeff Becerra
Consuming Impulses
 drown you in the depths of terror, forever
[Hook]
Peace Sells, But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's lying in a pool of blood dying?
Peace Sells But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's poppin' with the four pound iron?
Peace Sells But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's lying in a pool of blood dying?
Peace Sells But Who's Buying?
Who's trying?, who's crying?, who's lying in a pool of blood?
[Verse 2]
Stranded In Hell
, 
My America dated Betrayal
Brainwashed by a system that's created to fail
Freedom Or Fire, Securitron, ominous fate
Fear Factory manufacturing Hi-Tech Hate
A Slave New World
, world gone mad, 
A World Without Heroes
Used to go to shows surrounded by weirdos
Live at L'amours
, mastering the science of war
Reading 
Metal Forces Magazines
 dying to tour
Biohazards and Carnivores, living a Life Of Agony
Where to go, 
We Gotta Know like Harley Flanagan
Electric Funeral, Children Of The Grave Behind The Wall Of Sleep
Be afraid, killing to be saved
I Don't Need Society, Down For Life, foul and trife
Ill Bill, Dirty Rotten Imbecile, down to fight
Give Me My Taxes Back, money, God's a liar
Speak truth to Def Americans like Tom Araya
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Psychic Vacuum, jab you with a knife & stab you
Ravenous Medicine, Tribal Convictions, it's heroin
Experiment, Macrosolutions To Megaproblems
Let the revolvers solve 'em, Chaos Mongers, a Cosmic Drama
Peace Sells But Who's Buying, so I stay with the funds
We're real, so you die and find you laced with the slugs
With The Quickness you calling me my Sacred Love
I got Bad Brains
, the reason I spray with guns, now listen
[Hook]

(Ill Bill)
I be getting voodoo round like Greek sex
I'm searching for six chicks with sloppy tits hanging off their chests
Fuck kicking flavour in your ear
I'd rather kick you in your fucking cunt, then rip off your brassiere
I'm here, Mr. I-double-L- B-I-double-L
Puffing on a nick a crack in my jail-cell
They pay me well for my services
When I murder kids, I orgasm
Then I get rid of the evidence
Left up on the scene of the crime
I spit maggots out of my mouth when I rhyme
Bloody, little punk ass, fuddy-duddy
Let me get your crack-rock and all your money
Sonny, I'm a fucking sicky
I'll asphyxiate you then toss you in the lake like Ricki
Illing like a handy-capped spaz
Peep the Zoobaz, ripping' out the frame of your ass
Can you dig it? Uhh, Peep the Zoobaz (X 4)
(Goretex)
My lyrics spread nice over tits like calamine
Urine into slime when I circumcise your spine
I swallow Hashish cuz I don't need to grief
I chew vaginal beef with my 
Mackey and pull a goatee
I got a sweet tooth for some PMS leaking
I'm seeking the bloody tushy of a Puerto Rican
I'm getting iller than this here jones when I'm stoned
I'm banging women with nipples like fucking street cones
I'll leave NYPD blue, I'll asphyxia you too
My crew attacks like a pack of crazed Jews
I'm Shawn Michaels with the hot rod I'm ready
My aim is steady, point blank with my vainly machete
Satanic soldier, mad pages like Janova
From Brooklyn to Boulder a million jiffs be on my shoulder
I'm all about gored smack, beer back and crack packs
Snap jacks and anal tracks, god flesh I'm seeing blaaaaack
Can you dig it? Uhh, Peep the Zoobaz (X 8)

(Verse: O.C.)
Yo, behind the scene Rasheen calling shots
We debate in front of have-nots, lost souls from back blocks
Everybody in they hood feeling they all can rap
Thinking it’s a way out the Trap
School is lame, feel it, they have nothing to gain
All they know is guns and cocaine
I can’t recall the moment, the time the suits despised rap
Saying it was noise and non-sense
Once it became a voice for the people
They saw dollar signs, artists got signed
Low level opinionated A&R's
So off is they had no clue what was going on
Fast forward, cash out the start of minus
Skewer days, I really can’t call it
Evil seeds in place, all I’m seeing is a wasteland
Built off drugs, money and self-hate
(Hook x2)
I’ll tell you the difference between me and them
They tryin get they ones, I’m tryin get them M's
I want to be free to live, able to have what I need to live
Bring the power back to the street, where the people live
(Verse: Cormega)
I might front but I won’t go backward
I’m every slave’s dream, I own my masters
Unlike most rappers, even if I don’t go platinum
I live like I did, that’s all that matters
They said I couldn't do it, I did it
Independent with lyrics that don’t produce for listeners
Forward music no excuses
Only a chosen few show and prove it to be true to cultures influence resulted in moguls’ influence
Revolution’s the only solution
Get back to basics and stop chasing illusions, of vultures looming
Causing confusion, regain the focus you losing
The goal’s improving, the future of our culture ensured
If you're a vocally gifted artists supposed to be winning
But those who be spinning, dick ride are more than the women
Causin division by ignoring the feelings of fans who know what is missing
Hip-hop in its purest existence
(Hook x2)
(Verse: Ill Bill)
Another record label snitch but fuck it
You know, one love kid, no I’m not doing it big
Try to throw me under the bus and ruin the kid
And came back with full fronts and exclusive kicks
Stays up ahead, always adapt; evolve; survive
Sharpen your knives, in other words sharpen your mind
That’s your most valuable tool
Always stay alerted, wide open, alerted all times, actual truth
Make opportunities happen
Once that your a full time student of rapping, you’re responsible for your actions
No complaints, you ain’t got no time for that
‘Cause time’s money and you're in the red 9 to black
Get it where you fitting in there's more power in packs
Pop em before they pop us in the showering gats
From corporate pack lies to crack spots
I got the chop chops way before you popped out your mom’s box
(Hook x2)

(Mr. Hyde)
Super-civil arrest blast your teflon vest bastards
Hyde distress terrorists, the methodists of death bitch
Incorrect politicly linguisticly I'm lethal
Yo check my history it ain't no mystery to people
The Governer of Brit will have your mother sucking dick
Fuckin rubbin on her clit until she's bludgeoned by a brick
Yo to hell with secret-service men my burners stay disturbing them
They turned into my servants when my urchins said to murder them
All anarchists are lovin it while stubborn Feds are buggin it
Your governments discorvered cut to pieces in my coven kid
I'll tarnish you with carnage now your seargant's paying homage
Got Bin Laden and Saddam wrapped in bondage in the garbage
My knife's out, so stand back the White house is ran sacked
Despite how the Anthrax choked life out your grand papps
Torture is imense torture crawlin out your vents
The gore Hyde that invents put dents in your defense
(Necro)
I'm like Malcom when he came back from Mecca--not a racist
But when they come to kill me at my speech I'll shoot 'em in they faces
I lived a life of aggrevation, contemped in laceration
So I'm exempt from assassination attempts
Attack you like airborne pilots, beat you like General Cornwallace
You cornballs are minimal adjust your eyelids private
Ending your squadron, run up on you like Benjamin Martin
With the Inidan Axe peelin your skin back for startin
I'll start a revolution with this rugged rhyme
But fuck your Source cover I want my face on the cover of Time
You Benedict Arnold's will be smokin crack like bridges
We're burning bridges So you can't cross 'em cause our militia's vicious
The 13 colonies bring it to you, get on the horse
We'll be ripping your chest while they're stitching your flesh like Betsy Ross
Images of onslaught cadavers and bleeding
I'd give a shout out to the soldiers that fought so I could have freedom
(Goretex)
After war, on the return trip, burning my psyche
Extractin the passion from the paws of Christ it's pricey
Nuclear frost California first to break off
Space cowboys 30 cc's ready for take off
Lieutenants tank holdin my rank we climb sky ports
Islamic amputees disguised as cyborgs
I was born to die the first martyr
Torn from a place with burnt buildings and no father
Raise the ediquite of warface torture to make
War to Kuwait grenades tossed I through the corpse in the lake it's more cake
Revolution 9 new york quake it's an emergency
Bridges for tunnels this underworld is a murder spree
Fuckin with G world trade in the cloud
Terror network I'm still smellin people downtown
Whipe some tear gas the ying and the yang dead in the fear
10 to 15 they watch the dent in heaven appear
(Sabac)
They held me captive I was being bludgeoned and starved
Seeing stars half a day from introduction to God
Feel the scars on my flesh my whole mind was destroyed
Hardest test of my life, the kind I try to avoid
I heard voices in my sleep one night a visitor spoke
Quoting the art of war the voice had given me hope
Broke out a sweat grab the tech, shot away to freedom
Hundreds die for their lives and now I've got you beaten
I'm defeatin any enemy that comes in my path
Wether political or criminal I let the guns blast
Coming mass like Marcos and Brooklyn's my Chiapos
Rage a war against police they can't look me in the optics
Sabac is equivelant to the object of militance
Consider this your option with the lives of imbevelence
I'm commited and deligent, equipt with the killer shit
The opressors nightmare if I talk it I'm livin it
(Ill Bill)
I arrived at Auschwitz I was tattood with numbers for labor
Kids, babies, and mothers were sent directly to gas chambers
Stepping out of freight cars sorted by age and profession
And whether or not you capable of working the slave labor
Children and elderly people were the first to be taken
To shower rooms and exterminated and burnt to creamation
The rest of us kept behind and electric fence shaved heads
Starvin and workin to death and perished by days end
Truthfully we were the lucky ones, the fortunate
I remember stories of ways the doctors mainly used to torture men
Children and pregnant women unspeakable horrors
6 million martyrs from the sheet of the surgery with no anesthesia
I'm a prisonor of war or religion
A prisonor of nazi Germany I'm caught in the system
With dreams of torturing Hitler with blow torches and pistols
For every jew that died I survived my story continues

Aiyo peep it, I build like the pyramids of Egypt
Born October the first, it was an eclipse
Sittin' in the back of the Caddy with my daddy
Raised off of Curtis, Al Green and Barry
We came from the alleys to buildin' at rallies
Now we see unity from Brooklyn to Cali
I walk through the Valley of Death
Y'all better go and carry a vest
Cuz ain't no batteries left
I'm possesed by the spirits sometimes I'm Malcolm X
I confessed to the church and reversed the bomb threat
Bring the war to the Pentagon, I'll polly on in Babylon
They make hits like Barry Bonds
I drop jewels like Fahrakkhan
Y'all niggas only shine when them lights and cameras on
A Renaissance Child is gone, say "Shalom"
Open my palm and read "I'm a prophet of God"...

Rock spot veterans, plot upon medicine
Spot for our benefit, why God invented it
Fifty four seventeen Farington, moms rented it
Listen close for those that cannot remember it
Two bench room formin' in the project teniment
Mad beef everyday, even my grandma represent
Everyready cuz the PJ's is like startin' a race
Five minutes late, step up the pace
It ain't about where you from it's where you goin'
But that don't mean that you should turn your back on where you came from
Homey, digital mastered, first time on DVD
Critically acclaimed, my words rhyme on TV screens
Perfectly, scientifically, inertly
My verses speak mercilessly, manifestation of eternity
First degree surges move, mercenaries use serpent juice
Curse the youth, burn the truth, churches or schools
Goverments or army, Commy's fast versus Nazi's
Coke dealers, co-D's, it's Dhali Lama's or Swami's
Grip some produce at swap meets, gangstafied hip-hop beats
Brought by the El Dorados in Jeeps
Overseas we're top models and freaks
We pop bottles and grease
Hopin' we be promised tomorrow at least

Smell the endo, music blare out the windows
The beats reign, peep fools that stare at my skintone
Child of the eighties, crack and Reagenomics
Wild as a baby, I'm back to pay homage
Scarlets and windows, all the truth of my neighbors
Front of New Yig's bodegga was the fruits of my labor
The movers and fakers, justifyin' the blocks
Bunch of losers and faggots in disguise with the cops
The arrival of Watts and Bedstuy embracin'
The economy shot, red eyes and made men
Interrogation, evil, the trojan ain't protected by the nation of the people
Buildin' schools they neglected
A message from the Kings and Queens, Gods and Goddesses
Aggressive in the scheme of things, heart of Spartacus
Regardless if life ain't right or lookin' easy
Creativity grows in Brooklyn, believe me

LYRICS CRADES BY CHAKAL // BLOODY SUICIDE RECORDS // 2012

[Intro]
The final moment has come
[Verse 1]
Worldwide violence, unified tyrants and suicide pilots
Utilize science with the do-or-die mindset
Step in the 
lion’s den
, 
Leviathan
, 
Orion’s head
Destroy you then resurrect only to let you die again
Hundred man karate rumbles, bounty hunter body doubles
Jeff Hannemans
 with Nazi ovens, the 
Malachi brothers
Some will eat while others die in hunger
Cry and hug like when a reunited child and mother find each other
Meanwhile my music incite the fans
Got an army of Syko Sams to shoot your high school until the rifle jams
Waiting to exhale, unexplainable chemtrails
We set sail for parts unknown searching for death’s grail
Stumbled to the end of the tunnel but didn’t see light
Machine gun-toting Levites, suicidal Sunnis, exploding Shiites
The holy man swore he seen Christ
And yet still he craves to take his enemy’s life
[Hook]
I’ve been through centuries of fights, millenniums of murder
18 a key the price,
 defending them with burners
Take heed to advice, these dudes is heavy earners
Creeping like thieves in the night, we know we make you nervous
[Sample]
"They shall learn the price of their arrogance! Lock on homing devices and eradicate New York now!"
[Verse 2]
Stumble in looking like Hobgoblin
Lamas popping, choppers and rocket-propelled conflict
Firearms create the hollow tip mosh pit
Swap cars, Al-Qaeda entourage, Canarsie summertime, 
Chaka Kahn
, Blockparty 
Ricardo Montalban
Fuck your Fila suit, my guys shoot aliens
Who try to colonize inside tubes
All the while view mankind how predators define food
Heard this from a Mossad dude who resembled Tom Cruise
Truth-revealer, teach you how to put your kids through school
With two kilos, smooth hero, drink forties and shoot Cee-Lo
Fuck a bipolar, Mike Tyson fighting bolo
Kid Joe biopolo, album cover suicide photos
Corporate octopus, slaughter cult conquerors
War intoxicants, the Devil owns his own rocketships
Your karma been deposited, indulge in human sacrifice where the apostles live
Jeffry Dahmer
’s crib, nondescript from the true horror locked within
Let the eagle pop then dip, watch your mouth, you could get shot to shit
Right inside your crib, fuck a 2012 Apocalypse
Matter fact, open up your mouth and swallow this

(Ill Bill)
I’m the creep in the mask, I snatch the disease from the lab
I chop my enemies in half with guillotines and laugh
I speak the language of anguish, popping off your top and splattering faggots
A fucking bloodbath of madness
When I’m mad I throw tantrums with automatics
Put pubescent bitches in torture attics
Worse than any thought you could imagine
Kidnapped an entire school of bible kids
The ransom is a stolen stash of black market software and microchips
I’ve learned to rob banks with lap tops, from the home of the have-nots
Where soldiers are drinking blood like tampons
We blood thirstier than vampires
Blessing the reverend head to toe spit the chrome until my hands tired
Chorus (Ill Bill) X2:
Reign In Blood,
 
from a lacerated sky
Blastin guns and knives a hatred that you're fascinated by
Yo Its raining blood from a lacerated sky
Stab you in the eye fuck with me you guaranteed to die
(Necro)
I'm a robotic murderer with a computer in his spine
My creator has programmed me to kill you with a rhyme
Exterminate execute mangle and slaughter
Stab bludgeon rip to pieces that's my orders
Nothin human on earth could stop me
A tank blasting at my chest or my brain couldn't drop me
Adamantium armor wires and chips
Electricity running through my system makes me flip
My data base is filled with hate
Images of serial killers downloaded into my brain by tape
Berkewitz
, 
Manson
, 
Dahmer
, 
Rifken
Gacey
 
and Bundy
 I transform in an instant
To kill everything that lives
I got m16's attached to
 my metallic ribs
And I'm blasting all you government officials
Til your dead tissue its raining blood kid I'll kill you
(Chorus X2)
(Ill Bill)
Strife and death to all, loc’d the fuck out like Mike Concepcion
I bee drinking rubbing alcohol 
after the Henny gone
Morbid please slaughter sheep with walls that speak
New York streets are like amazing walls that bleed
Screaming like there was a crack addicted Newborn seed
Who's crackhead mother just died during delivery
The devils appearing bio engineering
Bio tech its godzilla versus god at the roman colliseum
Starting to peek want me in your apartment with freaks
While this bitch givin you brains peep the mark of the beast
The largest to the East where we sparking the heat
A bunch of undead zombies and we starving to eat
Two thousand and seven lazer weapons carve into meat
Pulling up in front of your crib with a car full of creeps
Who gives a fuck if a cop is telling me to stop or to freeze?
I told them how to kill a cop so they shot the police
(Necro)
Yo my Glock will fire at your crotch I'll rip off your cock with pliers
And strangle it with copper wire
Then stomp it you bleed to death
Your dead body starts to stink like armpits when I murder I feel pompous
You'll get your ligaments drilled
Battling me is like a conflict with a convict my ignorance kills
When I go nuts bullets enter you like cinnamon fills
Entenmann's donuts they're delicious with milk
Your face is suspicious with guilt you'll be viciously killed
And your family's faces get slit and stitched like a quilt
You'll be rocking stilts like a gimp just like Larry Flint
Crippled with an electrical chair to be carried in
Depressed like Rob Steiger the tiger
Corroded like the vagina of a biker I don't like ya
Disgusting like being forced to tongue kiss
An old slut with no cold cuts covered in fungus
(Chorus X2)

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
It's time. Yeah, it's time. Yo, yo
It's time to think about the repercussion
That could lead to heaters busting
And people cussing, and each of us in
Danger with a stranger, aiming to rearrange ya
Story so they can hang ya
Amplifying anger cause they blind
I couldn't find piece of mind with these rednecks
Sending death threats to my cell and landline for that
East Coast avengers, kill Bill O'Reilly track
Right-wing attack, they thought we were blacks
Hoping to attack, calling us uncensored versions of the N-word
"fuck the East Coast Avengers", that's all I heard
Plus my wife was eight months pregnant
When they had us on that Keith Olberman MSNBC segment
So flagrant, I was creeping and stepping, sleeping with a weapon
For the death threats that I was getting
Me, DC and Trademark, doing radio spots
While the feds was raiding our spots
We were spitting in the face of Fox
I'm on the government list
I still got like-minded fans
Bumpin' their fists to something like this
Fuck Bill O'Reilly, he had to get dissed
And fuck censoring my shit, dog I'm magic at this
Every action got a reaction so if you diss somebody with passion
Brace for repercussions, it's bound to happen
[Hook][x3]
Some beef is big, and some beef is small
What y'all call beef is not beef at all
[Verse 2 - Ill Bill]
Grim reaper repercussions, nine-milli' bustin'
Creeps and dustheads
Enemies of police that bust leads
Did a song called, How to Kill a Cop
Gave it to HOT 97, they play it the same week Diallo got shot
Then channel 9 put me on prime time news
I shouldn'ta done it, that was foolish for a guy in my shoes
Publicity's cool, but not all that glitters is good
Now I'm really on the radar of the pigs in my hood
People that barely knew my name now saying that Billy was good
Elevator, autograph-haters just jealous of the kid
Little bit of fame, little bit of money but big balls
My girl at the time worked on Rikers for Rick Ross
That "How to Kill a Cop" guy
Got my dick sucked by a policewoman, licenced with a Glock nine
Not all repercussions are bad, I was glad
Until I found out that the police chief was her dad
[Hook]

[Hook: HR]
We rally
Round the I
Around the I
And we never wonder
And we never wonder why
Nor will we say goodbye
That's why we 
rally round the I
Round the I
[Ill Bill]
Life's a battle of the network stars
It's unraveled & mentally scarred
I gambled on my destiny's cards
Acapulco gold
, jewels and coal
Fools behold, truth unfolds
View the road ahead of me, holmes
I've steadily grown
My heavenly soul control the deadliest chrome
But the life of a child is what God has blessed me to mold
This is something I put before everything, every thought
Every bit of energy is focused on her every need
I don't give a fuck how gangster you think you are
When you witness the birth of your first child it hits hard
Speaking for myself I'm still speechless
But I owe it to her to put this into words
In case I'm not here when she peeps this
God forbid, I plan to be here 'til a hundred and five
'Til my great grandchildren are alive
'Til they listen to this rhyme and wonder why
We rally round the eye
It's so we never say goodbye
Baby girl, it's for you, 
Riya
[Hook 2: HR]
I want you to love me
And never, ever worry
It doesn't matter anymore
No more
It's time for us to 
rally round the I
Let's 
rally round the I
Rally round the I
Rally round the I
Rally round the I
[Ill Bill]
We named you after my mother's mother
She raised me, now we raise you
When I look at you, praise due
Thank God for this beautiful life
Now everything makes sense, thank God for my beautiful wife
In Hindu, Riya's a singer, a beautiful voice
We could've stopped right there, what a beautiful choice
In Hebrew it means "joy", in Arabic it means "hope"
In Latin it means "queen", in Yiddish it means "rose"
To me it means kick down doors with four-fours
If grandma was still here she'd have given me the chrome
I don't grind for me no more, I grind for her
I don't live for me no more, I'd die for her
Human Rights
, we bringing the truth to the light
Bring the youth to the fight while we shoot through the night
This is dedicated to my wife and my baby girl
Riya Mae Braunstein
, I give you my whole world
I love you
[Hook 1: HR]

[Verse 1: Slaine]
I smell like American money, filled with heroin dummy
I’m the envy of all my enemies, they’ll never become me
I’m a gluttonous nut, trust me I’ll forever be hungry
God hates me, that’s why I talk to the Devil, he loves me
I’m the chosen [?] frozen in this cold asylum
Grew up in the code of silence, I rose in violence and
My mathematics makes sense if you know the science
I kidnap you and electrocute you with an old appliance
You trapped in the jungle with the boldest lions
Gimme, your hands jittery while you hold your irons
I been literally lost in my own defiance
Ever since Little League and I born in a home with giants
I ain’t talking about ‘bout the football team
Talking ‘bout part of the 
city that you could call mean
Beantown killers who have no second thoughts of sta
bbing kids
So I run around with criminals and savages
[Hook samples 1]
“Savage” “Animal thoughts” “Gorilla”
“Killas who stomp like Godzilla”
“[?] – we’re the first to kill”
“From the darkness” “I’m a motherfucking savage”
“Vicious, sinister” “Call me animal”
“Lunatic" 
"Leaving suckas extinct”
“Put fear in your heart”
“I’m sick with it” “Crazy” “’Cause I’m a motherfucking savage”
[Verse 2: Celph Titled]
If I’m not a boss than who is, the land mine legislator
Saying how the haters, praying god is [?]
If I don’t entertain you and you clown me
Then why you let your brain entertain thoughts about me
Maybe because I’m that motherfucker no rapper comes abovva
Grandaddy grenade, mans pants, and rap structure
Get wrecked with a Milli Vanilli cover
Blame it on the rain when I’m slapping you silly, suckas
My watch and my vest match a wasp’s nest
‘Cause we both know the time when you disturb the statue
We pointing the stingers at you
With [?] triggers, reach handle heat like Mike Tyson
Handle pigeon feet (the metal and the beef)
If you physically fit but out-physically fit
You do a urinal drain, I am currently insane
Suck on a death, yeah got a nice ring to it
That’s why the don Marco provide the motherfucking theme music
[Hook samples 2]
“Savage” “gorilla” “call me animal”
“Killas, none iller, like Godzilla”
“[?] – we’re the first to kill”
“From the darkness” “I’m a motherfucking savage”
“Sinister, vicious, malicious, pure insanity”
“Lunatic" "Leaving suckas extinct”
“Put fear in your heart”
“I’m sick” “I’m a motherfucking savage”
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Ill Bill, heavy metal king
Metal thing settles things, triple six
Like the Devil’s kids, we forever sick
Cross between an [?] and a terrorist
Or between a never-ending war and a metal gig
Rhymecore festival, rifle exit wounds
Shoot out your eyeballs, testicles, you a vegetable
Brain dead, spray lead, rain deaf, reign of blood
From a lacerated sky I’m a bastard with a nine
[?] a master, who bangs and who chops it, scandalous drama
Hammers and lava, [?], cancerous virus
Mad as tyrants, ‘cause after [?] I dance with the lions
Just wrangle the wire, dramatically multiplying
[?] chances to die, pull big black ratchets and eye
Patches, defy language and lies, angle survivors
Planets align, it’s mathematical science
Me, Celph, Marco with Slaine, it’s a savage alliance
[Hook samples 3]
“I’m a savage” “Animal” “Killa” “gorilla”
“[?] – we’re the first to kill”
“Psychopath walking, no remorse”
“Psycho from the darkness” “I’m a motherfucking savage”
“Sinister, vicious, malicious” “They call me [?]”
"Distinct"
 “Lunatic" "Leaving suckas” “Screaming”
“Put fear in your heart”
“Everybody knows I’m a motherfucking”
 “Savage”

[Verse 1: Slaine]
It was the time of his life, a capitalist with a communist wife
The Bushes are reptilians and Obama is white
I can feel it in the air, I got some bad karma tonight
Something is wrong, I think my mom is right
I never should have left but quitting is good as death
It had to be written, you cats had to be put in check
I made a lot of moves you dudes wouldn’t get
I walked a lot of places in this world you couldn’t step
I paid dues and made fools out of you fake goons
Seen eight noons straight, I can’t sleep, I ?
I sniff coke from fake spoons, dollar bills, and shaved poon
Tang, headed for the grave soon
I’m just getting iller with my thoughts lately
I would feel depressed if you started to not hate me
I’m paranoid nodding off dreaming of getting shot
Waking up, hopping in the Navi with the Glock
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
You pushed my button so here comes the nuclear man
This beat’s disgusting, reminds me of a whore with crabs
Came to power in Canarsie, south-east of Marcie
Kamakaze Anunnakis on Kawasakis
Bandana-faced killers, call my chopper Tchotchke
And say if I’m amongst the chosen ones then God’s a Nazi
Haitian earthquakes, Hawaiian tsunamis
Arms dealers buying from Commies
Violence and murder riots surround me
King’s County preaches strength proudly
Think rowdy, when we hit ground zero bro we bend soundwaves
Never doubt, we’re passionate like a Taliban firefight
Cameramen die for the story, what’s the final price of life?
What’s the science of the trife? Why do we exist?
Civilization is brainwashed, society is sick
I’m like a 1985 subway train ride
Get your chain robbed or stage dive, we stay live
[Verse 3: Q-Unique]
In a police chase with drugs and a stolen gun
Like Tiger Woods grab a nine iron and put a hole in one
Trying to escape the Devil’s deadly flames
But I’m a sex addict for tatted women like Jesse James
I look at the world through broken glass
With holes in you from holding gats
It’s when I’m lonely and smoking grass
If you know me show the cash
Homie I’m holding back, you’ll be folded holding an open gash
Powerful impact boom from the cannon
Catch a slap off the hands of doom from where you’re standing
Weed, crack and we’re soldiers
In Dapper Dan army fatigues with black metal toasters
Fuck how nice you are you one trick pony
A Mickey Rourke wrestler dying sick and lonely
A major sight is you and your rap partner in the cage tonight
Player I made you fight, I’m Dana White

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Live in the shadow of alien tribes with eyes the size of flying saucers
Funeral assassins spraying automatics out of coffins
Creeps with Lamas 
bogart like Feech LaManna
? supreme Japanese piranhas freezing the spinal
Draw, die first, Russian fanatics
If sleep is the cousin of death then death is the cousin of sadness
Murder’s the cousin of madness, love is the cousin of that bitch
I smash shit, give me my money I’m anxious
Crisp hundreds in the envelope, dookie on the ?
Spit roughish with the hella flow, hootie on the blow
Buy up arms, molotovs, Irish car bombs
Wild out squads, I body those, nine in my palm
Only the dead have seen the end of war
We use the tools of vengeance
Fuck interrogation room conventions
Keep your mouth shut, I’d rather stay true to friendship
And follow that rule until everything I knew has ended
[Hook]
I’m like a meteorite, I’m like graffiti you write
If you knew the meaning of life amongst the greedy and trife
Two hundred forty thousand miles of neural threads in the human brain
Enough to stretch from planet Earth to the moon’s terrain
All I need is nine millimeters to think
I put it in perfect perspective so that people can take
Time to digest my thoughts, connect to receiver
Slice heads with swords drench you with ether
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Maybe you been handed yourself one of them first class tickets to the resurrection
Religious symbolism, the diamonds witness perfection
Shocking and horrific monstrosity
Monolithic iconic I’m scientific
Like that runaway satellite that crashed to the Earth
The one they didn’t tell us about, our planet is cursed
Ever since the mysteries of the pyramids
My fingerprints, DNA, retinal scans experience
Have been most helpful, navigated through the dead pool
But told you about them guys with eyes like head wounds
Biokinetic ooze they drool
You read about them in these books you didn’t get from school
This is not an exercise, this is fullblown thermonuclear war
Get your radiation suits on, we shooters and more
We the most vocal outerspace post-global
Fifty years ago I wrote quotables now I accept the Nobel
[Verse 3: Chace Infinite]
While ministers hope and cover the truth from the populous
I resurrect the light down and save this metropolis
Where cops are just looking for ops to rob us and set us up
It’s second nature in the streets of America
Where devils have us incarcerated like savage animals
At the hands of a system designed to kill us
They plan to do damage with psychological tools more than banana clips
Something simple like making cannibalism glamorous
Cult symbols hidden inside of movies behind the crucifix
Lucifer’s influence is evident in numerous
Everyday objects, the dollar bill, CBS
The gleaming eye of Horus big brother watching your every step
Moving up the ladder with Jacob until you break your neck
We ain’t concerned with who’s a Mason, we facing death
Nigga we all masons, bricks working to cheques
Paranoid leaders singing orders through a text
Skull and Bones terror bomb symbolize death
Fists symbolize powers, hands symbolize sex
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Planetary]
Yeah! Yo, uh
A lot of rappers try approaching the omen
My poems will punish your people while I’m up at the podium
Pharaohs folding 'em, like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when the flow go choke your kin
Broke, I leave most of them, slow, I keep my motionin'
Eye on the prize
I silence the wise, my lyrics make a scientist cry
Making a secret society expose their purpose
Making 'em unleash info and explode in my surface
I'm taking my time to birth this, rap entity earthless
It's show time, there's no time, be ready when the curtain split
I'm hurtin' shit, too powerful for painkillers
On the concrete jungle we walk like trained guerillas
Untamed, and my niggas is 
Kane,
 
Kool G, Rakim, combined into one frame
We like the new mecca of immaculate rappers
Vinnie Paz, call the goons, now we back with the clappers
[Verse 2: Chief Kamachi]
Yo, remain silent, kill him with what I mentally says
Bloody Fez, choke you like an Indian rez
Kamach, animal Turk, sick with a cannibal smirk
Welcome, this where the murderers lurk
It's my mind, that make sure that the Sun can work
Scorch bodies, leave all of your gunmen hurt
Pharaoh sultans, create a serious cult jam
And my hand is where the tears of the pope ran
They stay watching like they keep me on a scope cam
I'm in Heaven with the angels that smoke grams
You need God, that's why the earth so damned
International, trying to get my flow banned
That's cool, if I don't kick these prayers
A lot of floods and famines gonna hit these years
Kamachi back on the chapel stairs
Open the clouds, let the thunder clap your ears
[Verse 3: King Syze]
You wanna put your money up? Then muthafucker then put it
For your family's sanity man, I wish that you wouldn't
Niggas got nice flows, just dont know where to put it
And I know your whole life your raps are edited footage
And y'all mixtape niggas couldn't see my plateaus
All up in my presence, while y'all actin' bashful
King Syze casting an ecliptic rap flow
Y'all little light niggas couldn't feed my shadows
From, city to city, intersection to section
But you reflexin', with or without a weapon
I'm always steppin', never scared
But always and forever prepared
Yeah the ones who drink gas man is revvin' their gears
[Verse 4: Reef the Lost Cauze]
You now rocking' with the foulest clique in the continent
Total dominance, rise to prominence
In my prime like Optimus
, stand in astonishment
At this 
conglomerate
, 
an axis of evil
I know where Osama is, he down in 
Camp David
Down and dirty like a damp basement
The champ must demand greatness
From himself, or be another contender
There's hundreds of niggas
Dead left under the river
From the days of slaves
To hurricanes in Orleans
See my people's graves floatin' amongst the waves
There's hell to pay, but
The devil don't take checks
I tried to send a message to God
His phone don't take texts
I need a new plan, a crook with knowledge
Times is hard homie, why I took them dollars
Man, my momma got a mortgage
And my little baby sister need books for college
I rob all of y'all
[Verse 5: Doap Nixon]
Hey, yo, they want the hood in here so they called me first
I give 'em rappers gatorade cause they ball with thirst, UH!
This is more than music
But these niggas is mad trash
That's why the stores refuse 'em
Yo, I'm out in Georgia, went straight to the block
I'm seein' cats motorcyclin'
 dawg, I'm doin the walk
I'm an O.G., call my Italian niggas a wop
Though their papers ain't right, but they got weight on the block
I love 'em uh
Hand to hand, see your hands ache
I drunk so much syrup dawg I stopped eatin' pancakes
Ya niggas cool dawg mine's absurd hot
Stop frontin' like you's a killer money, your nerves shot
Yo you's a 
Paxil
 nigga, dumpin' Zoloft in coffee
AOTP what exhaust be
Can't keep it gear, cause I'm blinging with F's
But I got my mind right so swing your shit to the left
[Verse 6: Demoz]
Nigga if I had 24 hours to live
Fuck 24 hours, gimme 24 seconds
Vin
 I'm drivin' off a bridge
Broken rib, no windshield, covered in kerosene
Gasoline tank filled to the top
Magazines of these phony rappers ripped in pieces
No priest is, strong enough to take me out of my zone
I broke Jesus, choke niggas who squeal
Rob niggas who steal, kill niggas who kill
I'm too sick for a pill
Man these niggas ain't real, they real fake
They say they a man but they fuckin' reveal snakes
That's when you put 'em in a truck with their grill taped
Rip in reverse then run into a steel gate
I'm a suicide driver, never been a liar
If I don't kill you later, I'mma kill you 
Mañana
You don't want no problems
You don't want no drama
Nigga 
I'mma take a trip with your baby momma, suicide driver
[Verse 7: Celph Titled]
Ya better cross your T's
Cause we'll dot your eyes
You can say that you specialize but pharaohs will optimize
Backstage will get a bitch back smacked there
The mac glare like dirty south pimp slap clap snares
, YEAH!
Holy paragraphs, what kind of shit is that?
I'm Jesus in the flesh so this is motherfuckin' Christian rap
Y'all just Christmas wrap, must be the secret Santa
My reindeer aim near, pierce you with the antlers
I made 'em go easy, and called off the wolves on my AOTP radio CB
Cause y'all ain't worthy of grenades and RPGs
Slit throat, hope you float with sardines and seaweed
Cause this is C-E-L-P-H demonic symphony
Listen to the hell we make
And a year before your kids tenth birthday came
You didn't have to wait for candles on the cake to see the nine flame
[Verse 8: Vinnie Paz]
Respect a G, my clique clap at you incessantly
I lay back and drink alcohol excessively
It ain't a rapper that's alive today that's testing me
I got degrees in being ignorant and weaponry
A 40 oz and Dutch Master is the recipe
That's my shit there, that'll be the death of me
Give me a death mask, better yet an effigy
I understand the math of death and it's complexity
I understand how you was violently murked
I understand how you was raised under the lies of the church
But understand and recognize that I'm cursed
With the ability to end your fucking lives with a verse

[Verse 1: Planetary]
A lot of rappers
Try approaching the omen
My palms are punishing people
While I'm up at the podium
Pharaohs folding them
Like washed clothes again
I'm a vulture when
The flow go choke your kid
Broke

Slow

Eye on the prize

With lyrics making scientists cry

Ill Bill on the beat
Billy Crystal
What up baby
La Coka
AOTP

[Verse 1: ILL BILL]
Let's play Dungeons & Dragons
 on mushrooms & acid
Like Ricky Kasso, smoke angel dust & kill these hippie assholes
Light the chemicals ablaze - Relevance appraised
Venomous exchange of terrorist acclaim - Inheritance of hate
Severed heads of state in a parade of chanting Satanists
Acts of heinousness are sprinkled on our plates like bacon bits
Swallow while you raise your fist in protest
Your true emotions camoflagued like God
It's convenient like Amazon.com
& we're all guilty as charged or just simply involved
Often brainwashed by quick money, loose women & cars
But maybe that's the way we're meant to be
Ignorant mutants for nukes
Trapped in a matrix ruled by shooters in suits
I think we're more than that, I'll quarterback
Time to clean our house & take our corner back
Put a message in the music - This is more than Rap
Or at the very least, it could be & it should be
So I gotta pay it forward cos I learned alot from 
Chuck D
& 
Henry Rollins
 - College was an empty promise for me
Music's influence was way more honest to me
Or maybe that's just my excuse
Because I dropped outta high school at 14 to pursue music
"It was all a dream."
[Verse 2: EL-P]
Live in a still from the worst movie ever's worst scene
Antagonists
 
stand proudly in the stench of all their dirt sheen
Looks like God and them forgot to take their happy pills again, scream
Cos every sheisen eater from your nightmares getting top cream
Mud is the name you been given - Shit is for dinner
Your average beginner might wanna take a fetal position
I feel that, nothing's promised but static & dirty conscience
Or waking up like the dawn is the start of another problem that's real fact
Trust me the dustedest type of function's you having to sit there
Grumbling while dummies run the discussion
So I'm a master of the numb it down, drown the voices choice
Every drug invented got attention from me, desperate to avoid the noise
& I never learned a fuckin thing except I don't know fuckin shit
All that I ever had was madness & the luck to get the chance to spit & I'll take that
Cos by my calculations that's as good as any day job
Thought I told you that I'm fucked, why you suprised I always stay hard

[Al Pacino voiceover]
SHE'S GOT A GREAT ASS!
[Verse 1: Necro]
Let's start drinkin'
We'll soon be swingin'
I'm fingerin' you
Pullin' out the 
Maxi Pad
 string in your cunt while you singin'
A song of demise
With a long dick between your thighs
Inside your ass, my penis slides
While the skeeza cries
My dick will never soften like I'm in a hardcore film
I got sweat all over my balls, now lick it off 'em!
Whore, you took it in your anus, you're shameless
Slut is what your name is, you're brainless!
Your pussy is sweet like a danish
Fuck a zorg chop fat dark with mad pork
Leave her with a gap doing the catwalk
I wonder where you get your hunger
Old ladies, soon you'll be buried under lumber
If you was younger, I'd tongue ya!
Jerkin' off, I've tore my arm ligaments and burnt my palm
Bitch, I'll turn you on!
I'm gonna cum till my sperm is gone
It's domination of hoes
Till their vomiting up the chunk of salami pushed in their throat!
I got you in check
It's embedded in your head that you're a bimbette
You're not a princess, I pimp breasts!
I'm not impressed with your skin flesh
My only interest is that you get undressed
And don't get arrested for sex!
You piece of shit with thighs
My dick's inside your mouth
My balls swinging left to right
You're hypnotized!
I'ma have you fuck 10 different guys
That all have some type of disease inside their system
SURPRISE!
[Hook: Jerry Butler]
JUICY
FUCKIN
HOT
MELTING
SCORCHING
BURNING
FUCKING
BROWN
DISGUSTING
Shit filled fucking ASS!
Look at that fucking ass! Shit comes outta there!
This production is a hot production
Another fuckin' bitch gets fucked in the ass!
Big fuckin' dick rearing out of your ass!
Ass fuckin'
ASS

ASS
[Al Pacino voice over]
SHE'S GOT A GREAT ASS!
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
I'm a gaper maker
The ATM Euro wager disgracer
The deep thinker looking for winkers with deep sphincters
Freaky bitches pounding they asshole with three fingers
And they lick them
I'm that freak lookin' for that type of victim
Y'all big bubble butt cheerleaders and dick eaters
Black, White, or Asian, especially sexy Latinas
I love bitches, I love that pornographic type
With an onion booty shaped like an apple that's ripe
Ya ass wide open with ass-pirations, we ass worship
The ass-interpreter, I understand that ass perfect
Confessions of an ass-man, the crack addict
Bitch, I'll make that booty talk the most fantastic of languages
Weapons of Ass Destruction
, it's another ass-candy massacre
Assfest, God sent me on this mission, I'm blessed
Moses split the asscheeks of the last freak on Earth
For what it's worth, bitch I'll make you scream and your pussy squirt!

If it wasn't for Microsoft, you faggots wouldn't have no fans
If you lived in the Middle East, you faggots wouldn't have no hands
Still a bunch of jerk offs, I fuck your mother then I murk off
[El-Producto]
You could suck tits like Schillinger's kid in isolation
 provokin panic
And fucked in the ass by Sting for seven hours, tantric
Set the phone in a fan-zine for the the man boy love circuit
Society, a stain, plain murderers are worthless
[Ill Bill]
You know you heard it
I grab your crucifix and invert it
Fuck a consequence, I'm choppin heads, gangster apocalypse
Walk into banks and write "withdrawals" on the deposit slip
This female cop ran up on me, so I shot the bitch
[El-Producto]
From the brain of John Malkovich
Insane from the stain frame
The twelve monkeys caught in a corrupted cock blender
Serenity hits the shits
Dickin of lips of Rocky Horror Pics
Face, scar tissue, standard issue
[Ill Bill]
I hit you with your entire generation
I'm friends with God, and I'm friends with Satan
It all depends upon my situation
I'm flippin the chains to keep my pistols equipped with lasers
Stranger to major labels, Ill Bill
Fuck a tell-lie-vision, this is cable
[El-Producto]
Like an abusive home with sitcom laugh tracks
Grafted from television's golden era
A demolition pirate, drive a plain automobile and spit metal barbs
Play jacks without Barbie
I'm on a battlecat bombin baby
[Ill Bill]
I'm mad crazy
Used to be a really nice guy, at one time
Now I pull out nines, at one time
And love crime, the drug find
It's way into rhyme
The rhymes find their way into my drug
I'm in love with hate it's great
The hooker had me hooked just after one date
"It's Grrreat!"
[El-Producto]
A time that miscreants
Shit more than just dissin and stimulants
You caught in a small space
Dusted with a psychopath simian
Justice is a garden tool
In the hands of the militant
Primitive villagers with no food
The weaponry is crude
[Ill Bill]
Back from behind bars
I be like Biggie Smalls and die large
[El-Producto]
With Patty Hearst cleaning guns
In the back of a stolen car
With the hands of a bleeding bueracrat
Banned from Ishtar
[Ill Bill]
I like good girls
But triflin bitches get my dick hard
[El-P]
Hard, hard, hard, hard

Simian drugs, simian drugs

Everybody's in love with our simian drugs
"D-R-U-G-S'S"

"Where you at monkey?"---] D-Stroy

Droppin from planet rap
The CEOs deflect bullets with laptops
To sell crack rock
We be "Licensed to Ill" like Ad Rock
[El-Producto]
And Stanley, 
a Mortimer Trading Places
With a faceless mascot
In a monkey suit with bloody execs and a 
L.I.R.R
Reached they last stop

Last cop, beat by my my blueprints
I'mma do shit if the shoe fits
You'll take a whole precint with you too, kid
[El-Producto]
Mascot of mayhem
Direct from brainstem on tilt
With hands across the genocidal American quilt
"Ahhhhh!"
[Ill Bill]
I walk around like it's game over (sorry)
Peep out the replay
The opposite opponent got his brain exploded
[El-Producto]
It's all midget whores on stilts
Tall tales from little fucks
Can't you trust a flip flace
Like large Marge in a Mack Truck
Back up
[Ill Bill]
The new paranoia
Look over contracts on behalf of lawyers
Laugh at toys, I blast at asteroids
Go ask your daughter
[El-Producto]
Illicus, spillicus
Plus funcrush that's killin this
Willingly similar pillages
Filling this blank page with syllabus
Centuries certified murder hurts
Best when flesh left on quarterized
Labeled my words in the dirty earth
Feelin this
[Ill Bill]
If not, you better have your fuckin head examined
The type of shit I'm on
Cats have only read about and carved in granite
Pull up your skirt and cause your heart to vanish
I start the madness
Pull out and bust my art upon the canvas
[El-Producto]
Yo, loose leaf
You're spooky too, shoot community
Via CIA spook without truth and immunity
Pehaps doom will be the proof, in the streets
Soon to see, looters on the loot
They got guns and impunity
(Chorus)
[El-Producto]
Yeah, baby
*Mr. Len cuts and scratches for the rest of the track*

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Every Kennedy was assassinated by the Illuminati
They should’ve went to Yankee Stadium for Giuliani
Said Halliburton
 
impersonated Sunni jihadits
Or at the Black Sabbath show pulling UZIs on Ozzy
Experts in judo and karate, shooters with shotties
Use computers to rob commodities, abuse technology
Produce monopolies, Google and Youtube robbery
Automatic, in other words these goons shoot constantly
Starting innocent enough until the militants come
Bringing bow and arrow nukes and guerrillas with guns
But sometimes it’s like killing a cockroach with a sledgehammer
Buying black market hummingbird stealth-cameras
Beyond the gates through the eyes of horror
Walk the seven churches channeling a fiery aura
Cautionary tale, extraordinary rendition
Torture me in jail and then the warden went missing
[Hook: Ill Bill] x2
Yo we just talking, conversations with God
Shout at the Devil, hundreds of rebel martyrs assemble
Under a black flag with the white skull and guns on it
Drink vodka straight out of the bottle and puff chronic
[Verse 2: Slaine]
Yeah I can feel the fire again, the clench in my jaw
The rage in my chest, the stress in my palm, the pressure is on
The message is still reckless, my death-wish is gone
My focus is back, I'm sharp and obsession is strong
Critics told me that my message was wrong, they wasn’t listening right
Poetic prophet with the petulant storm
With the testament torn, smoking angel dust inside of Bible pages
My records was born from passion and survival rages
From people seen passing locked inside of cages
Running streets and hiding gauges, I’m performing live on stages
As positive as it can be for me
It’s my prerogative, are you sure you want to beef with me?
Nah you too chickens are too fishy, smelling faggoty and trashy and maggoty
Holding the liquor bottle nothing can stagger me
People love to hear stories of riches to raggedy
But what about the snitches and bitches always nagging me?
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Everlast]
I don’t sleep, I don’t rust,
 
in God I trust
Got a blood, got a cash, got a power lust
Got a bag of trick knowledge and an eye that’s all-seeing
While you’re waiting on the comeback of your supreme being
Master technician of the superstition
Doctor and a scholar, apocalyptic horror
Since Genesis I spit Revelations
Within infinite patience I 
United Nations
I’m the rising sun, I’m the new tomorrow
I’m the skull on the gun, I’m the song of sorrow
I’m the thirteenth hour, 
I’m the wisest owl
I’m a soul-eating predator, I’m on the prowl
I’m the stolen land, the wisest man
I’m the hidden hand, I’m the oldest plan
I’m the shifting shape, I’m the changing form
I’m the 
novus seclorum
, I’m the coming storm
[Hook]

[Verse 1 Ill Bill]
Every society honors it's live conformists and dead trouble makers
I'm the Son of Satan, sculpted the culture of 
the
 ancients
Burn me at the stake with my 
left hand stuck in the Matrix
I'm the apex, 
I steal science offa spaceships
Black water contractors captured off a camcorder
After Mass slaughter, violent massacre, Masters of Order
Burning effigies of presidents and American flags
Veterans clash for the chance to sell terror for cash
Babylon destroyed the base of mikdash
Death cults, murder squads, exploded churches and burning mosques
Throw your dice now you destiny's cashed
And they seize a war with planet over centuries past
And the mysteries remain unsolved, colossal pyramids on Mars
Visitors beyond the scriptures of Allah
God is on the side of the ones with money and large armies
Pray for death of these brainwashed zombies, 'Society Is Brainwashed'
[Hook]
I bet you can't see what i can see
Thats right theres a few things we have to adress
I bet you can't see what i can see
When im in the streets i always remain cautious
Its good, god damn
[Verse 2 Ill Bill]
November 5th, 2001, less than two months after 9/11 occurred
The infamous William Cooper was murdered
Ex Naval Intelligence Officer, but now author of Behold A Pale Horse
He beared the cross
I can't say I agree with everything he wrote
But admired him for speaking his mind though
Never holding his tongue for nobody, your 'Society Is Brainwashed'
Guns in each others faces for the same lies
Same everything and same nothing
Same bullshit materialist of the Third World man's luxury
This false flag f**kery, an AIDS infested junky
Your Lady of Liberty can't f**k me
Can't touch me, the black pope superior general
Tim Osman
 riding like a 
Piru from Inglewood
Bring the hood up to a hovering mother ship
They already made the switch to the One World Government
[Verse 3 Ill Bill]
Amongst the Ivory Tower witch doctors
, when this explosion
On the groom lake landing strip silicon, sorcerers abandoned ship
Famine gripped the planet with the gigantic Satanic fist
Believed to be linked to Al-Qaeda through a sandwich business
I dont advise you to believe these could be camera tricks
All I'm sayin is to ask questions amateurs
What Hollywood tries to pass off as fantasy
Might already have happened in actuality
And vice versa, if Jesus Christ was a person, 
who was Mithra? Who was Krishna?
Who was the first to be baptized, crucified, resurrected
Betrayed and made into a martyr for someone else's redemption?
Old men start wars for young dudes to die in
Madison avenue tellin you what you should be buyin
Religion and science always profess peace
But in the end who created the deadly war machine Society is...

[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Gun in my hand, shoot
Hand me a gram, shoot
Misunderstanded with the family man, shoot
I'm banging, I'm Beirut
I'm training in state boots
I hang with the same group
Aim at your grapefruit
The shit that you say cute?
I can't relate, duke
The trey pound's related to the ache in the face full
Nigga, I hate you, break you, Ivan Drago
I'm rushing to put pellets in your pecan pronto
P! Ain't talking money, we can't convo
You pussy under pressure, pa
P stand strong, though
I bring in the shells, I beat up your squad
You singing in jail, you Chico DeBarge
Fucking nickel bag steamers
I sell coke that's whiter than milk of magnesia
Frankenstein when I'm making mine
You think you rhyme, you should think of mine
Solomon Grundy
[Verse 2: Ike Eyes]
I made my bones shaving Sharon Stones in a school zone
One way ticket from the projects to a pool home
Trapping, balling, and rappin is the hoods holy trinity
I sold a pack 'fore I lost my virginity
Surrounded by speed freaks and weed geeks
Quiet down, listen up when g's speak
Return of the body catcher, the crown's been captured
Caught up in the rapture, I slaughtered a bunch of rappers
Ain't no Tarzan in the marshland
Fumes from the meth cook
 turn me into the swamp man
Get the red wine out
White lines in Amy Winehouse
Walk fine lines in hindsight
Coulda made some better choices
I didn't always have to listen to the voices
Thug in my bloodline, mud pies and drug buys
The dead live on and love dies
Solomon Grundy
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Ill Bill murder futuristic like Paul Laffoley
Haul your casket away
Assassins'll spray
Reptilian like a cannibal's brain
Horrifying like dying in a two-passenger plane
Nosediving, fire in the sky, showers of flame
Houses of pain on cypress hills and mountainous terrain
Even a lion chills after an ounce of sour to the face
I'm the lightning that the Vikings worshipped
The sight of when a rifles bursting
Write subversive
I'm a decisive person
Liquor on a bullet wound
, feel the Henny sting
Everything is everything
I'm a Heavy Metal King
Been labeled intelligent, irreverent, malevolent
True indeed, plus a veteran
On point like the Devil's chin
Surrounded by apparitions & statues of smiling death
Assassins with pistols capture your dying breath
Like you stepped into a horror flick
Kill you then resurrect you in the middle of a blizzard of hollow tips
Solomon Grundy

I'm surrounded by hatred and lust
Angels and dust, cocaine and sluts
Dangerous thugs, blaze you with guns
Lace you with drugs
Murderous cyborgs, disguised as blind men with guide-dogs
Design wars, final call, homicidal gore
Torture chambers and rape-rooms
The same goons, drinking Grey Goose and grape juice
What's really good or bad is relative
Never been beyond neutral
But if you fuck with my family I shoot you, I'm too crude
My poverty got me bugging committing armed robberies
Voted the most likely to probably die violently
Who the fuck are you, stupid?
I carry two clips
One to murder you, the other to shoot pigs
I'm like Miami Beach on new years eve
Blondie singing Rush Rush
, give me yayo hanging with the Gipsy Kings
I spit these things
Major businessmen spitting flem
Kicking these raps and kick you in the face with Tims
Foot up on your desk
Four thousand square-foot office supplies
Fought to survive, torture your mind
Car-chase, two cop cars collide
On the Belt Parkway I'm rhymin' for the cop killin' to dive
Nothing's sacred anymore, take your last breath
What I am, what I want, I'm only after death
 - I'm obsessed
If superheroes were real, they'd be evil
?? tele-feed
Take the shit over and never leave
American dream
Bleed like a heroin fiend
Heavy-metal heroin scene
Forever retrieve
Caught you with your guard down and my pistols up
Hit you with the four-pound and you spit some blood, faggot!

[Verse 1]
Killing snakes that sidewind
Tripping on Jakes & Drive-Bys
Walk around high
Sniffing a Thai eighth and five lines
Five nines, hit you five times
I'll rise from the grave seven days after I die to spit flames
Spit fireballs, spit volcanoes
Spit molotovs at popstars, exploding bombs under cop cars
Arms dealers that I met I bought nerve gas and laser rifles
They CIA they take they names from the Bible
Jesus specialised in chemical weapons and bio-robotics
Met him in Cairo he was chilling with this guy Mohammed
Ex-PLO Honcho, that went AWOL
He sold black market organs at the CIA store
They introduced me to they bro Moses
Pulled out an eightball of that Grade-A shit, and froze noses
Then they told me bout Ish and Isaac
Two brothers, one was telekinetic, the other psychic
They was after me, they was asking mad questions
Jesus tells me he suspects they were hired by the Russians
I always thought that they was cousins
Who gives a fuck? fuck them faggots, 
when I see them I'mma buck them
[Hook] X2
It's a hijacking, when I shot that pilot in the eye, laughing
Landed the plane by myself, the only guy standing
Swordfish, 
more than Halle Berry showing off tits
It's real, Swiss bank acounts and terrorists
[Verse 2]
Blowing up buildings like Tyler Durden
My minds perverted
Eight women orgies, these congressmens wives are dirty
Extroverted like Wild Wild West strippers
And death lifts us, to higher levels
I hire devils to kill other devils
I the funds expensive? never any troubles
Shoot outs because of my Uncle, Forever bubble
Bombed the airport, jetted in the cherry red Porsche
Catching head from this whore, that I met at the store
Jesus had the Lamborghini and that bitch from Tahiti
That liked to swallow ecstacy and sip some Martini
A disturbed past, involving all types of terrorism
I know how to dispense nerve gas through televisions
Tera Patrick and Adriana Sage
Undercover FBI agents that look great, and give fanastic 
brains
Adriana Gave me a platinum chain
A mercenary in this savage game, I Skyjacked the plane
[Hook X2]
[Verse 3]
Assasins get fazed, thrown in stealth planes
Exploding death pays, it's gangsta
You fucking faggots know the next phase
You'll get your dome X-rayed
Kidnap you like los pepes
'Til the chrome Tec spray
You get pussy, I own sex slaves
It's God's will, fuck with me you get shot and killed
Chopped into pieces and 
stuffed in the trunk of a Bonneville
Globetrot, smoke pot, with bitches that so hot
They go to the Grammys wearing a see through dress and no bra
No panties, fuck with me I'll kill your whole family
Cyanide now or later she choking on candy
I choreographed the goriest massacres
Bizzary to Africa
No story is graphic-er
[Hook X2]

Heavy Metal Kings
I told Ozzy to bite the head off of that bat, I’m awesome at that
Cauldron of crack, my symphony’s a waltz with a gat
Dance with the Grim Reaper, leading up with the street sweeper
Then fuck her with the broomstick until she bleeds ether
Feast on the heart of Goliath, heart of a lion
Part of a dying martyr brigade conquering tyrant
Gave birth to your death - 
I’m the father of violence
The Alpha, the Omega, the palm of Osiris, 
palm of Ramirez
My concert appearance is like a cross between Manson and Osama with lyrics
This is hardcore hip hop, homie
You just escaped from the Matrix if you’re hearing this song
Let’s celebrate this like the Vikings when they conquered York
The Gods of war, we never knock - we shot through the door, we entrepreneurs
Move this to the unusual type of freebase
Move swift like a nuclear device in a briefcase

[Verse 1:Everlast]
Yo, I've been rhyming since my daddy's dick first got wet
Kicked a hole in the womb of my mother then I jet
Back to the scene of the crime
A true mastermind
I'll never do time
[Verse 2:Slaine]
Nah, but I do watch my watch till the second hand stops
Till' the bars close down and the records get dropped
Piss drunk in the parking lot speaking dumb
Gun all sticky from the Puerto Rican rum
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
I keep it real like the 80's when we flooded the block
Stick up kids went from baseheads to suckin' the cock
The hottest bitch in my projects discovered the rock
A year later had the monster climbing out of her twat
[Verse 4: Slaine]
This is a stick up
I told you you could reach for the sky
Fuck a chip off the brick or the piece of the pie
The worst thing they did to the kid was leave him alive
Now I'm ruthless moving with a reason to die
[Verse 5: Everlast]
The trees got me so high kid sniff your next line
My culture's refined
I'm heavy on the grind
I'm hard in the paint
My uzi weighs a kilo
I'll smack you in the face and crack your head like Cee Lo
[Verse 6: Ill Bill]
It's a fact hommie eagles don't roam in flocks
But the eagles that I got will put a hole in your top
So predictable I'm already knowin' your plot
It happens so fast you won't even know that you're shot
[Verse 7: Slaine]
Till the concrete is painted with pain
Cause you bein' dead is the only way they'll ever say you were slain
Black scully, black bandana, and black coat
With the co-leader in the House of Pain
[Verse 8: Danny Boy]
You already know what it is
It's the pimp, the sniff and the aw shit
That ain't dandruff homeboy
Hell naw that ain't dandruff
All in together now - That's coke (x5)
[Verse 9: Ill Bill]
That's coke in 
freezer bags
 
hidden in the ferarri
More raw than Big Daddy Kane spittin' with Marley
More white than them three bitches sniffin' with Charley
That's coke like a boston george new year's party
[Verse 10: Everlast]
The motherfuckin' svengali
Mob boss got body in the XL Denali
With the 
mossberg shotty
Got a full box of shells and a ransom note
That ain't gun powder out on my dash (that's coke)
[Verse 11: Slaine]
I'm raw as sushi
Belushi's spirit probably is with me
I'm Rick James bitch, ask Bobby and Whitney
In the hood where the maniacs will rob you to get me
Gettin' blown by Paris, Nicole, Lindsey, and Brittney
You shittin' me?
All in together now - That's coke (x12)

(Verse 1: Ill Bill)
I never liked 
Imus
, always thought he was a dickhead
The media want to try to censor my lyrics instead
I'd be a fucking idiot if my lyrics didn't reflect
The pain caused by a world by a business of death
Blowjob from your mother and wife at the same time
Sit back, recline with my cocaine rhymes
Heroin beats, let the rhythm hit him, terrible heat
Relentlessly, effortlessly hit them
Street villainess, we the chosen of man now get in the van
I get it cookin' like meth in a pan
Tie your arm up with a belt and inject in a scab
Round trip to the drug spot set in a cab
Rolling Stone concert flicks, thousand dollar chips
Model chicks with Katana tits and hypnotic hips
Get sprayed at your table at the Babylon club
Left dazed, mangled, disabled, and splattered in blood
(Verse 2: O.C.)
Me and Bill are both 
martyrs
Flows so similar to Harvard books inside libraries
One step beyond smarter
Cajun hot, we throw it up like a half-court lob
Into the quarter when the shot clock does 'em
So sick, fuck around, become a victim
Don't blame me, young cats put themselves in this position
You're facing a dilemma
There's no telling when you might end up face off with a nutcase and a sinner
Embrace this and parish, face that shows terror
No punches or edits, I rival up the devil
I walk past everything falls dead
Verbally spreading my medula
Ho store speech released unchained mechanics
In the form of bar with the music
Join us and permantly sleep cause your appointment
Two guns, me, O.C and bill, we're double-jointed
(Verse 3: Jeru The Damaja)
The rhyme alchemist, hip hop scientist
Mix bonds in a lab like an Al Quada terrorist
My shit narcotic from start to finish
I knock out so many teeth I get kick backs from dentists
I feed MC's to the vultures, man
While their chicks' asses up in the air like Chin Chan
Wanna test this? Have a good medical plan
Cause I bash you in the dome like Captain Caveman
And this dope's a billion bucks a gram
I wipe the blood off my mic and fuck a female fan
You never thought you'd see me, Bill, and O on a track
So dope the DEA thought it was crack
When it comes to rockin a mic I do works
So many exotic feats they call me Captain Kurk
Shit-faced like the jerk
My shit's a street sweeper, your shit just squirt
> > Lyrics posted by Heroin4yourears < <

First time I did acid was in Flatbush, Brooklyn
East Flatbush to be exact if you looking for accuracy
Fuck you shackles, I'm free
Thank You LSD and mushroom fragments in tea
Watching Yellow Submarine and laughing at Blue Meanies
The true meaning
Open the door and walk through the ceiling
The matrix is gone, I view clearly
Realizing society is brainwashed is a brutal feeling
Finally see who's really the truth and who's the demon
Who's still sleeping in the womb dreaming? Who's scheming?
Who's smoking angel dust with Rick and Russell?
Who's equipped to hustle?
Who's the one that always thinks first and who's the muscle?
Who's the bible burner?
Did 
that guy that wrote Fight Club
 realize that 'Tyler Durden' rhymes with 'violent murder'?
Sometimes I gotta
Rethink my strategy
Rethink reality
Rethink sanity

[Verse 1]
The anatomy of a school shooting
, 
shotgun under my trenchcoat
Columbiners did it
, dead spoke - bloodred soaked
My mind consume the doom as I walk through the school
15 people killed and over 14 wounded
My name is 
Eric Harris
, 
I was forever harrased, an outcast
You fuck with us and now me and Dylan is pulling out gats
I've been wantin to murder people
Suicide is played out, if you gonna die, take people with you
We've been planning this before the kids from Jonesboro did it
And I wanted the world to know when people died why we did it
I even killed myself but don't feel sorry for me
Feel sorry for your seads as we spread the diesease
Another bloodbath coming soon to a school near you
Smalltown killing-spree that's organized by the youth
Fuck the media, them fags be disguising the truth
Dragging my name through the mud when televizing the news
A bunch of ticking timebombs y'all, is more like me
Overflowin with hate, bullied to get raw like me
They constantly get picked on and shitted on like me
You'd probably get your head blown off by a kid like me
I put my mind to it and what I accomplish's frightening
The right thing, no matter what you idiots might think
Check it, I did that shit so idiots might think
This ain't a game
, 
the nerds that you be fuckin with might flip
[Hook: repeat 2X]
It's like this, what's more fun than slice wrist?
Kill that teacher that you hate, spray 25 kids
You'd be famous just like me if you did what I did
This is the anatomy of a school shooting
[Verse 2]
I see dead people, it isn't my fault that they were evil
Fuck a favorite I hate everybody equal
Bitch I warned y'all, didn't I?
Now everybody wanna talk shit and cry asking why
- 
Two geeks picked up guns and turned murderous
All of y'all under beneath me you don't deserve to live
Two nerdy kids is that a crime?
Why I've gotta be one of the cool kids just to walk by
- without being tripped, thrown down on the ground and kicked
Insulting me for no reason, I was treated like shit
The teachers let it happen
I've even seen some of them teachers laughing
That's why I had a smile on my face when I started blastin
I wasn't crazy - all of y'all were sick
I was the nicest person in the world - y'all were dicks
Don't even try to analyze me now you have no chance, back then
- maybe you could've been my friend
[Hook]

The Crazies, live in the subways
Completely control the underground
They're Night Raiders
[Mr. Hyde]
Yo
Don't be concerned about what you heard about me word of mouth
Facts I'll take the burner out and blow your fucking sternum out
I'll keep the fragments, little pieces of your clavicle
In my cabinets to prove you 'ain't shatter proof
Put the four fifth to you, let all four clips in you
Pain experience is like a Pitch George grip to you
Now you scarecrow dead
, watch me tear whole heads
Off at their shoulders I cough as you smolder
Fresh ash particles contaminate the sky
From your flesh barbeque, inhale it to get high
Or pull the tool in your bless, leave you laying on the deck
Fuck your bullet proof vest son, I'm aiming for your neck
Now your beautiful jugular is soaking up my rug
'Ain't no crews rugged'er, I'll prove it with a slug
See, we 
psycho+logical
 
your team's methodical
We back slap fag rappers like bitch prostitutes
Scream, and pray its only a nightmare
And hope your gaping throats really only a slight tear
In truth you slice right with the nice nine inch knife
Every trife rhyme I write ignite twenty-five alike
[Goretex]
Barn of the naked dead
Garnish your flesh, carving your head
Me and the 
Covent
 starve women till there orange and red
Take creep pictures, renounced, I'm the young Keith Richards
I'll turn a MILF evil, feed her some speed with killer mixtures
Riding Bibles like a man tongue
We slime buckets, where sluts get gutted, fucked and punched
With there tampons, a blood fetish
A monstrous grimace like Al Fish
A moment of silence the count is about to affix
Playing God is such a thrill for me
My young ministry with six women become un-inhibited they kill for me
The God of love, I leave scars and misery
See letting these women go don't make sense, it's a sin to me
The night surgeon, 
I flip it like a Christ diversion
Welcome to Hell, selling souls right in person
The gore merchant, 
murder for pigs is always worth it
Expressed male, set my panties and bloody curtains
[Ill Bill]
Call me the sad wings of destiny
Spread across the planet like leprosy
Destroying your entire life's legacy
Nuclear priest, 
fire storm, human defeat
My goons are elite
, murdering you with the tools of the street
The morbid sorcerer, forty four magnum officer slaughterer
Calling your coroner, crash street at the corner of Lauberman
Jumping the L
, between cars 
puffing the L
Robbing you on the way to Carnarsie for something to sell
And I will strike down upon the with great vengeance and furious anger
Burying you with illirious bangers
A total nightmare, chrome nines appear
Walking with no sign of fear
Designed to tear you with this piece of these vagina scare
Pussy clot, ill guerilla pimp make the pussy pop
Another rookie cop got shot another pussy drop
Either we mad men or mysterious villains
Or billionaires, sociopaths, or serial killers
[Necro]
Murder rappers with a shooting titanium microphone
Bullets in your brain rip threw cranium like Styrofoam
Four thugs who step to me who catch belly slugs
Now your four faggits dead laid out in a row covered in smelly rugs
Dieing to meet ya, slice up each feature
Your grill's a bloody mess, your face looks like a pie pizza
Like bleeding pimples, we hold katanas
The scientist analyst, I'm breeding pit bulls and piranhas
The messiah ain't nothing but a creep in a trench
They found Jesus downtown Brooklyn sleeping on a bench
Lobotomy class, we experiment cut and stitch
Open your brain up and analyze it to find out why your such a bitch
Put gats to you
Throw you in a lake naked with a block of cement attached to you
I don't sweat to shoot you (uhn uh)
Rather cut your spleen on screen like a Tom Savini scene
Execute you

One night backstage at Irving Plaza
 
at a Madball show
[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
Hey yo Ill Bill, will you sign this for me?
I found it at Amoeba,
 
it's The Green CD
(No doubt kid, what's your name) it's MC Lars
(Word, Howie Abrams is a mutual friend of ours)
(He played me your joint) what'd you think of it (I think it's bugged out, it's hot)
Thanks, I like your last record a lot
Your lyrics are graphic, much like your brother Necro
Is he psycho? (I don't know, it really depends though)
(He's 
Psycho+Logical
, half psycho, half logical)
(Half businessman, half put-them-in-the-hospital)
Business and art, there's a very fine line
There's the person that you are and the person when you rhyme
But the best MC's bring both intertwined
(I agree, that's when the best of both worlds collide)
(When the realness pops off one time for your mind)
(And your words cause the people in the crowd to riot)
[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
[Ill Bill] (MC Lars)
I grew up on heavy metal and hip hop
The energy was the same to me, it was insane to me
It made me want to rage against the machine
Pick up a guitar and scream into the mic like Run-DMC
(
Nine Inch Nails
, 
Primus
, 
Weird Al
 
and King Missile
)
(Influenced me like a postmodern epistle)
(
Geeked out on my Performa looping digital drums
)
(
Playing rock guitar in punk bands just for fun
)
(Who's your favourite rapper?) 
Rakim
, 
G. Rap
 
and Kane
KRS,
 
EPMD,
 
NWA
Public Enemy,
 
Shante
 
and LL Cool J
I could keep naming MC's all day
What type of metal stuff you listen to (
old school Slayer CDs
)
(
Biohazard
 and 
Bile
 were the bands for me)
(The first time that I ever heard Chuck D)
(Was the Anthrax CD, Attack Of The Killer B's,
 chorus
[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
So Bill, what's your take on censorship?
Politicians on a church, state fusion tip
(I speaks my mind while kids I went to high school with)
(Bleed on the sands of Kabul hit, it's bullshit, Lars what you think of it)
Out in Iraq
A lack of dialogue between the people is whack
(In fact I speak militant like Black Panthers)
(These gas prices got my people with seeds having to gank pampers)
The answer is not plutocracy
The answer is not hypocrisy
The answer is true democracy
(The answer is the dialogue constantly)
[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
As many places I've been (As many people I've met)
As many haters I've dissed (There's people that I respect)
As many time that I've failed (As many times that I've won)
As many lives I touch, the dialogue has begun
[MC Lars] (Ill Bill)
Hey yo Bill, we should do a track together
(Word, word, let's do that)
Oh wait, we just did

[Hook]
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), these people fear me
I’ve seen murder, disease, it’s all near me
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), I know you hear me
I wrote it fucked up, you see it clearly
[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Enter the cult of the death’s gods, 
traffickers and ex-cons
Skull and robe, hold the globe in outstretched palm
A revered image of truth, here with the youth
Vivid living proof spitting like El Chapo in the booth
Death is the beginning, so without fear we run towards the willing
Manufacturing murder anthems and songs of killing
Ballads of massacre, the psalms of the forbidden
Cash is the master of every broken law that is written
Burning up the abomination conjuring hatred
Virgin of the incarcerated martyrs of Satan
Persecuted like the Inquisition in Spain
Condemned, made to repent my religion of pain
Set on fire like in Salem where the witches were slain
Behind bars till I die for these bricks of cocaine
No regrets though I pray to my saints often
Holy Death, 
lying awake in a coffin
[Hook: Slaine]
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), these people fear me
I’ve seen murder, disease, it’s all near me
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), I know you hear me
I wrote it fucked up, you see it clearly
[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
They say the world don’t spin without the hand of God
While them damn priest trying to get a kid to give a handjob
I guess that really means I am odd
Cause I don’t let my kids get on their knees to pray for damn slobs
And I ain’t talking about Jesus see
I’m just speaking on the cardinals, the BC
This is the crazy shit that we see
That’s why I’m grateful that the streets are the only ones that teach me
Yo, and on that note, they giving pedophiles months
While they give the homies life for dope
What kind of shit is that? That shit ain’t right though
If a grown man wanna buy the right blow
We’re like Vegas in a sense, you know it’s false hope
Instead of slot machines and card games it’s all coke
They making hustlers like us walk a tightrope
While every other fucking snake is alright though
[Hook: Slaine]
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), these people fear me
I’ve seen murder, disease, it’s all near me
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), I know you hear me
I wrote it fucked up, you see it clearly
[Verse 3: Slaine]
New York is inhabited, there’s smoke in Los Angeles
Long arm of the law is broken with bandages
They call me Slaine, the La Coka evangelist
Our spoken languages provoking the scandalous
You dummies are dead, dummy, there’s a gun to your head
There’s no loyalty left, just money instead
My blood speaks the truth that none of you said
You should be fighting the power, you’re running instead
Where’s your heart at? Your bones weak
You talk loud all the time, when I’m here you don’t speak
When the heat’s on in front of you the pressure is real
You’re a bunch of fucking sheep to a messenger’s hill
I should have chapters in the Bible cause my testament’s real
I’m a product of violence and mescaline pills
Was you born to be a faggot cause it seems like it
Your life ain’t nothing like mine, you just dream like it
[Hook: Slaine]
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), these people fear me
I’ve seen murder, disease, it’s all near me
This is all there is, now there ain’t shit left
It’s like I’m looking in the eyes of the saint of death
(La Santa Muerte), I know you hear me
I wrote it fucked up, you see it clearly

[Intro]
Houston police say that the CIA and the FBI both say that Carnaby never worked for either agency, but his family tells a very different story saying the 52 year old spent about 30 years serving his country
[Verse 1:Ill Bill]
Ayo the pilot had his gun drawn
Like when the shoe-bomber Richard Reid bit that stewardess’ thumb off
You're done for
When you die you go to Heaven, till then welcome to Hell Spawn
Celtic Frost at the Felt Forum, I’m never wrong
Stop acting tough, small criminals can steal more money with laptops than with a mask or a gun
Intelligent relevant heretic elegant terrorists
Presenting death sentences with malevolent eloquence
Label you larger than Hajj
 and spark a jihad
Adolescent martyrs in mosques ? bombs
While the lords of war barter their arms
Concentration broken by the sound of fight jets barking at God
Gat shooters they snatch AKs and chains
My shooters snatch planes and cause international mayhem
In the mountains of Caucasia caught four pagans in an orgy with lord Satan
Onward the war rages
[Hook]x2
I’m surrounded by hatred and lust
Angels and dust
Cocaine and sluts
Dangerous thugs
Blaze you with guns
Lace you with drugs
Murderous cyborgs disguised as blind men with guide-dogs
Design wars
It’s the final call
[Verse 2:Vinnie Paz]
Phony money and economics, that’s the shit predicted by the prophets
Black guns, black helicopters
What is the connection between Jesus and the Shriners?
What is the question to the virus and Osiris?
That’s why the gun is always on the hip
I learned to never sleep on devil and to come equipped
I don’t never speak on nothing, always button-lipped
Whether it’s why the Sun exists or if it’s rugged shit
Y’all are devilish and Vinnie move with God power
I called Bill to go him meet me at the God hour
It’s never been a question whether or not I’m star power
The only question is whether or not the God’s sour
Yeah in other words sick of the Amorite
Reverend Dr. Malachi Z. York
 had it right
Dealing with sound right reasoning and acting right
Teaching people how to handle ratchets and a hatchet right
[Hook]

Verse 1:
And so another adventure begins
Ski slopes ski's automatic weapons
Down hill shoot out with Bill they out for vengeance
Those two brothers, the same two muthafuckers i mentioned in swordfish, yeh Isaac and Ish
???????? and Isaac's a bitch, 
Ima kill em both and still be left with five in the clip
These people invented and injected the mind with a chip, they shot and missed
Almost skiing off the side of the cliff
You know i shot back Isaac was hit, a bullet ricochet offa his hip
Hit his brother Ish in the lip
A avalanche final finish there trip
Afterwards i had a ski buddy sucking me off up in the lift
Fuckin me off up in the whip, dustin the ???
See me ????????? puffin a spliff
??????
Mind full of evil thoughts and my enemies bitch
Chorus X2:
I murdered the beast with the six figured hand head of the goat
Seven horns, seven red blood shot eye balls that glow
Whata yall know? You can practically taste the brain matter
??? the final scene
Verse 2:
I laugh and spit in the face of death 
load em with lead
Go to the sunset on a black horse holding his head
Destroyed an army closing in, reminded me of that time in Brazil
When my government assigned me with a license to kill
Fresh out of CIA torture school
Taught me the most effective ways of making prisoner of war talk to you
From Europe to South America blood baths kidnappings
Sounds hysterical orgies in a mansion
Where the cult leader drained war heads for antidotes to viruses
Corporate alliances, we buyin shit
Finance security first world terrorism
Combined it with religion is proven the best business
Ask Osama ask 
Bush
 ask any body
Give me a ferrari and box full of money
A double agent with a hunger for paper
Now run there payment with my gun in they face
Chorus X2:

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I've been an outlaw and a gambler
Long as I can remember
Drink whiskey from a bottle and always carry a banger
Poker face, womanizer, bank robber, and legend
My name ring bells across the frontier when I'm mentioned
When I step foot in the saloon, I get a lot of attention
I reckon there's haters; you're threatened by the strength of our weapon
The speed of our bullets you wanna taste the heater, I pull it
I'm a goon with a golden six shooter and a mullet
Four dead, jump up on top the bar then shout
If anybody else want drama better, pop it off now
How many times this situation happened I can't remember
So I turned 21 and got drunk with the bartender
Gun slingers think they Clint Eastwood
I'm like Jesse James, ride up on a pony dump six in they face
Twistin' they frames like tumble weeds
Blister they brains then bounce to the whore house for more whiskey and things
[Verse 2: Goretex]
The Navajos and Mayans wrap their skin in tigers for battle
Feeding the cows; like Josey Wales, I'll hold it down with two barrels
Back to the tarots, prostitution rackets in Paris
Sippin' cactus, dippin' on stallions, my corduroys are blood splattered
Decapitated, my spurs carve like taxiderm'
Torched the mayor, jacked on his wife, and let his carriage burn
Numerous moonshine runs in Kentucky
Keep the powder up in the ten gallon in case I get lucky
Old medicine man on his porch staring at commons
Four horseman, we riding through your prairie like shamans
Close to the dream, shot up the voting machine, it's progress
Kidnapped the senator's daughter, penetrated with objects
Whiskey bottles and twist offs, killers no conscience
It’s either dead or in jail, it’s high noon for the convicts
The bloody sickle strapped to my chaps is conquest
Its a gory rhyme, this battle hymn [?]
[Hook: Necro]
Four horseman are drawing nearer
On a leather steed we ride
We've come to take your life
All through the dead of night
With the four horseman ride
Or choose your fate and die
[Verse 3: Necro]
There's no law spittin' phlegm on the floor and clappin'
I'll test you; skin that smoke wagon, see what happens
I'm tired of your gas jerked that pistol and go to work
Throw down boy I'll bitch slap you till your lip blood squirts
My aiming is more than precise when I slay men
We both got gats, let's play for blood, just say WHEN
Let's settle this, so we're crystal clear
On whose the nicest and fastest ever; I'm the deadliest pistolier
There's no future for dumb fucks after my gun bucks
Smooth when I'm maneuvering my six shooter like nunchucks
Shooting clowns in they faces, then drinks on me
Piano man Stephen Foster, Camptown Races
I'm down to dump anywhere, I'm far from a punk
I got two guns; one for each one of you when I'm drunk
Watch out when the squad's out
Don't you ever try to man handle the caval'
We'll cut your fucking pimps heart out
[Verse 4: Mr Hyde]
O.K. Corral style shootouts at sundown
I'm taking ten paces, splatter faces with a round
Quick draw like Will Carver with the .44 revolver
Got a fist full of dollars once I started robbin' [?]
The tomb stone terrorist buckin' down my nemesis
Creeping in the crevices, wanted man ever since
Sixteen, wanted for the murder of a deputy
Robbed 30 banks and they're never close to catching me
Drawing fire first your destinies inside the dirt
Cause my trigger finger's faster than the hands of Wyatt Earp
I'll stumble in a bar, guns and bourbon in my clutches
Five card stud, catching straights and raw flushes
Wild bunch horseman the fugitive outlaw
With double barrel action son, I'll shoot at you southpaw
Young guns with total style, always the most vile
Riding through your streets, turn your hood to a ghost town
[Hook: Necro]

[Verse 1: Esoteric]
Esoteric is a life taker, deck you with a haymaker
Widow maker, camouflaged wind-breaker
Savage apparel for the hazardous Pharaoh
AOTP keep your bullet trapped in a barrel
Go ahead and circle your wagons while I'm reversing your patterns
Ski mask flow, I do everything in murderous fashion (bloaw!)
Perfect assassin, ghost protocol, Ethan Hunt
Demigod putting bodies in the trunk
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Powdered out, Coka Nostra, scraping up the white lines
Outta town local yokels, hating from the sidelines
Light up a murder verse, fire like a burning church
Microphones sorta like a scalpel when the surgeon works
Gimme perverted nurses and librarians
Knowledge born through caesarian, Luciferian
Billy Crystal, who compares to him?
Shooting Romans out their chariots, always prepared to win
[Verse 3: Godilla]
Rise of the phoenix, or an iron butterfly
Evidently proof our legacy wouldn't die
No shook and jive, I took my time
Don't look behind, from books from lines, no hooks, just rhymes
A simpler time defined, by vinyl and boom box
Write a banger like the heat outta the shoe box
Technology killing the art like Suge did 2Pac
So I brought freedom to the back alleys and rooftops
[Verse 4: Fredro Starr]
Ayo it's real in the hood, blood spills by the liters
You can run to the store, get killed for Adidas
Why I keep more guns than Gilbert Arenas
Four-five or ninas, like I fill with heaters
Rather be on stage rockin' filled up arenas than
Stuck in the hood, fiends still trying to beat us
Hardcore bitches catch chills when they meet us
Overcrowded jail cells fill with repeaters 
[?]
[Verse 5: Sicknature]
Sicknature throw a party (where)
Out the window like "Get the fuck out!"
Snowgoons, frost giants, show 'em what Ragnarok 'bout
Party turns independent, fuck a piece of crap at the major
We'll have your fucking ass on a stick like Vlad the Impaler
Industry rapper acting like puppets on chloroform
Call yourself monsters, you nothing but muppets and pokemon
Ya ain't spooky, my legacy tunes is killer cold fruity
Not even ten global warmings could melt the Snowgoonies
[Verse 6: Punchline]
I'll bring forth a legacy for y'all to remember me
Deposit made to the bank of your memory
Attitude fuck the world like Ron Jeremy
Add to the fact that I need sex therapy
Era be etched in stone Face unknown
I'm famous, for breathing life to the microphone
Metaphors and rhymes, hard on my grind
On my tombstone write the greatest of all time
[Verse 7: REKS]
My name REKS, I bear the flag for the bottom of the bottle
The gone and forgotten brothers million man marching
I'm a marksmen, show off darts and red category
Add up all these rappers you'll be hard pressed to rep before me
Pawns be birthed in the laboratory
Somewhere in the M.A.-chaching, chaching-assachusetts
As you choose who you in the booth with, be wary of me
Momma named me Cory, but you can call me Ruthless
[Verse 8: Thirstin Howl III]
Yeah yeah. Thirstin Howl the mother fucking third, on a Snowgoons tune (ha ha)
I'm the double-L, general, heaven, hell
Wedding bells, wear it well
Thirstin Howl, not no Gilligan shit
Never had a deal but I'm still in this bitch
Brownsville stripes, earned every one
Puerto Rican, sleepin', same cemetery Pun
Big vig low, crazy catalogue
My main bitch pussy say Made in Panama
[Verse 9: Planetary]
Planetary, ATOP shit
OuterSpace, this is how it feels when the heat hit
Snowgoons shit, piece make the moon split
Even though the sun gonna shine when I move quick
I'm a living legacy that's heavily influenced
By the evils set through the tones of my music
I don't give two shits, y'all just irrelevant
This is my house we pulling guns for the settlement
[Verse 10: Virtuoso]
In a rhyme cipher, you're futile like a blind sniper
I'll strike like a typewriter, hot shit like a fried diaper
In my dynasty, my legacy spread vaginas and dead MC's
Next level trees like forests that cover Lebanese
Border
 scorching devil weed Roll a gram and smoke this shit
Ignore the rebels, bleed slower than Milošević
You know me bitch
, oh you don't, well who am I?
Virtuoso, supersized, flow thee foes euthanized
[Verse 11: Maylay sparks]
Mezzanine, 
[?]
 with Belgian beers and corkscrews
Grey goose spilled on my suede shoes, y'all fake dudes
Slaughter rap, broad street bully green a quarterback
Talk slick three hundred yards quick like Mike Vick
White kicks, tattoos drink pierce from ice picks
Might flip when trying to take the mic from my tight grip
The 'goons and Maylay Sparks, black attack
Iron swords hover over mixing board to keep it sharp
[Verse 12: Swann]
A young adolescent searching for a dream, willing to succeed
By any means taken every step to be seen
Every lyrics stronger than a blast
To be remembered when I'm gone, living legacy forever-lasting
This pen and paper got me through the hard times
Because of how I rhyme I'm ripping out, rocking, acting out of line
Divine style got you right to a T
If you ain't with us underground, stay the fuck out the scene
[Verse 13: Sav Kills]
Divine styler, whiler, rhyhme skills get fouler
Mic profiler, lights out and sessions out ya
Performers, I enter the stage they scream louder
Embrace the mic, I'm seein the sea they scream shout ya
Stadiums, Palladiums, Snowgoons who fating them
This from the essence, from the ground up we blazin' them
From the slums and the ghettos where they raised us from
We fan glorious, the crowd, we amazing them
[Verse 14: M-Dot]
Hot like a ghetto get to live in the [?]
Spit a rhetoric metaphor sentiments lifting your tenements
Residents feath'rin' senators,
 I menace and I reddit
My hand scrolls the evidence, my pen flawless excellence
You're the tiny little ittl bittle, find the fiddle
Mind is brittle, crime biddles, my rhymes define the riddle, middle
Name, Dot, first name Man, metal
Hit you, press rewind, Snowgoons bless the mind
[Verse 15: Reef the lost cauze]
Yeah, and the rest is mine
They needed a hero and I'm just in time, I'm a monster on them drums
The father to you crumbs, it's brotherhood
Snowgoons, godfathers to my son
Let the gats burst, I react first, these rappers lust to get their wax worth
But their wack verse only equals what the raps worth
Now wipe that smirk off your ugly fucking face before I smack earth
Wind, fire, empires, we build quietly
It's snowgoons forever, rise high as the sky should be
The legacy survives by me
Your favourite MC in here and that's who the fuck I should be
Keep your eyes on me, cause when my brothers decide it's beef I'm the guy who squeezed
Die violently, I fucking hate y'all publicly and privately
This is Snowgoons Dynasty

They're coming here. They're waiting at the edge of the city
They're peering around buildings at night
And they're waiting, they're waiting for you
And they'll take you one by one and no one will hear you scream
No one will hear you SCREEEAAAM !!!
[Necro]
Stick an ax in your guts like Maximus bumpin 
Exodus
Bonded by hemoglobin dumpin clips in your tits the 
annocist activist
The brotherhood of evil mutants run up on you
Shootin people fuckin feeble unit none of us are good
The toxic avengin your head the reverend of death
In the end the revelation of flesh being stretched to the ending
Your homo click is exterminated like vermin
Roamin through train stations terminated by electrical currents occurin
I rock a pair of Nikes hiking through the streets
Like a viking holding spikes I'm civilized and devilized don't sleep
You're not ill you perpetrate the blood that circulates
In your vertebrae your squirting your shirt with the perverted murder percolate
The revolting insulting cult king is resulting
As the sickest fuck on the planet earth catapulting molting
I'll be a billionaire and still be down to throw you down the stairs
And kill you rockin you with military keep it ill on you
[Ill Bill]
I don't care come God of atrocity 
fuck you with 5 fingers constantly
The monstrosity king of the scum bags king of colostomy
My gun bang we run things give you a neck tie
Look how your tongue hangs it's bloodbath pornography
Splatter fest the sado masochist I'll paint the walls with your blood
Physical graffiti cynical agreeing
This is murder world welcome to your death after the afterlife
I'll murder you again laugh with the burner to your head
Suicide soldiers like the heavens gate die obsessed with hate
Blood stained holy books are like a test of faith
Like the word of God telling me to kill, or the word of pagans
Telling me to sacrifice you in the name of satan
Pain lost an abomination unholy combination
Circle of tyrants we control an entire nation
That can attack you like the Dawn of the Dead
Rather be backstage catchin head from your daughter instead
[Goretex]
You on all fours candle stuck to your back like gauze
I'd rather make a lamp shade of your skin tac you to walls
When the boredom sets in pull out my axe from the stall
Howie pops up enough packs to last us til fall
The wizard of gore diminished like your skull with a sword
Emotionless leave it to a finish like midgets and dwarfs
God hates us all so we burn churches your mouth's a urinal bitch
Blaze with the deep purple I hurt you on purpose
I never got shit handed to me
The silver spoon is only used to cook the food in the pot your kid's a fantasy
We sick goons we don't give a fuck what you say
Above the law dead an apology strait from DA's
Blaze law killa go coked berretta the scheme
If I don't blow up this lab in the kitchen from methamphetamines
The wall's closin in too much to fight
Pay Per View suicide we all die tonight
[Mr. Hyde]
Yo I slay who I wanna when creating a horror
See my state of nirvana is to make you a goner
Stick a pick in your stomach because I'm sick of you frontin
But still I'm quicker to bludgeon and catchin victims with nuthin
I'll whip out the sharp shank and stick and jig up with ease
I watch your ligaments bleed with very vigorous speed
My left hook is known to put a bitch in the scene
And transform his face into mystery meat
After I clap at the wig your skull will snap like a twig
There ain't no little body counts I make my massacres big
Carefully put in my clips so that the bullets could rip
You gettin butchered to bits to me is as good as it gets
Bet you leave on a stretcher when the 16 wet ya
Wit ya cap twist it back like a major league catcher
Your head will bleed ketchup and your garments are soaked
Watch me finish the job with somethin sharp in your throat

[Verse 1]
I seen a bitch named gutter slut talking to a paraplegic about violence
Then threw his wheelchair into the fire pit
Nihilist becomes entombed, xecutioner becomes obituary
Birth the kings of doom
Earth becomes Black Sabbath, turn Ozzy to Dio
Surgeons fuck that plastic turn Cosby to Theo
Jody Foster's army missed Reagan
James Brady got sprayed quick fast like he played for sadus
Nuns have no fun
, homie, 
ask Melissa
Don't break the oath
, you'll be tortured by shadows that whisper
Satisfaction is the death of desire
My 
perseverance
 lead to the rise of 
supremacy
The quest for fire
Inventing the wheel, 
re-inventing the steel
, 
killswitch, a fixation on darkness
Perception is real, 
take as needed for pain
, 
lack of almost everything
Slap a ham, half a gram of dope is so heavy, dig?
[Hook]
The mind is the most dangerous weapon alive
Spin doctors operate behind enemy lines
Mind control, something you could potentially buy
The new holy war has arrived, you ready to die?
[Verse 2]
You're a 
powerslave
, 
somewhere in time
, 
piece of mind
Keeper of the 7 keys in seven churches arrive
Under the sign of the black mark
, 
to mega therion
Under lock and key
, 
tooth and nail
, hellion
From the ashes of hellhammer, 
morbid tales
No one ever really wanna buy peace
, war prevails
Shout at the devil
, dogs of war 
bark at the moon
The mob rules
, 
heaven and hell
, it's up to y'all, choose
From enslavement to obliteration
, youth of today are sick of it all
In a warzone where pistols are god screaming out 
"lights, camera, revolution"
From the wonderful folks who brought you Iraq, here's the new execution
The malfunction, the regulator, the re-ignition
The fearless vampire killers on a mission
People crazy enough to think that they can change the world, do it
Kick down the motherfucking door and walk through it
[Hook]

[Necro]
Yo, yo, yo, check this shit bitch
For all you slime buckets, all over the land, peep it
[Necro]
Yo, I'm dancin on your grave like Baryshnikov
I'll rip you off
Leave you in the desert 'til the vultures strip your corpse
Then rape your fuckin' wife, until my dick is soft
'til the flesh is peelin' off
I'm a devil consealed in cloth
Walk, walk or get stabbed with a fork
You got a hole in your stomach
Yo plug it up with a cork, you dork
Lots of blood loss, red cross
Couldn't help your dead boss cut his head off
Brutal, sadistic, the only way
I'll be remembered, after I'm dismemebered
And my bones decay, a rap legend
To the aggressionary session
My invention of tention and powerful progression
It's time, for sick rhymes, lunatic lines
Hit your mind like consumin strychnine
For all the shell, clips and Glocks
You step to me with a weapon
You'll be reppin' your clique in a box
[Hook]
The most sadistic, you think not?
You might get shot, put 'em in a plot
We ain't playin, we ain't rhymin' for nothin'
Yo this shit is our life, so let me tell you somethin'
If you ever diss me I'mma bring it to you
Got a crew of psychopaths that'll stab you up too
Now say violence (violence), death (death)
Yo there ain't nothin left to say, this shit's fresh
[Ill Bill]
I'll kill, you could be my latest victim
I'll take a shit on your brain and make you sniff it
Piss on your bitch's tits and make you lick it
You fuckin' maggot
You probably fucked one hundred faggots
Your a gay thug that loved jail and love gettin' your ass whipped
Come around here actin hardcore
You never did dirt, you gonna get hurt
Pull up your pink skirt
Your pink panties'll get your whig damaged
Go eat a dick sandwhich
I can't stand this motherfucker
Make this bitch vanish from the planet
I'll hit you like a ton of granite
Get your blood splattered
Face bashed in, you can't win
I'll stab you in the head wit shishkebab sticks
While watchin' mob flicks, nasty like armpits
When I be suckin' on you mom's tits
She my bitch, she on my dick
Tell that trick to stop callin' my crib
Why'd you say she wanted to kill the bitch?
Smokin' green clove, walkin' around town flossin' the free clothes
Doper than Special K explodin' in the fiend's nose
[Hook] {*fades out with gatling gun sounds*}

{*scratched by DJ Eclipse*}
Ill Bill, spit the real
What the dilly yo?
The name's Bill
What up Bill!
[Verse 1]
Dropping screen tanks, driving cars
Jack you out your green Benz
Drop the top, take a deep breath then I begin
The way the world bounces
Fuck a nickel bag, we burn ounces
You a gangsta?
Fuck shootin' you, we burn houses
Have you runnin' out your crib, butt naked with a half a brick
Hangin' out your asshole, lookin' like an asshole
Fussin' with me, guarantee homicide
Devil and God collide
Why you wanna make your mamma cry?
Hang you with shoelaces, Doomsday
A free thinker, squeeze the trigger like its tooth paste
The game's different now, the rules changed
It's like who's broke and who's paid?
Who's dope and who's played?
Who's smoke and who's sprayed?
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Reverse a back exit
Drive ya car, jack you out your black Lexus
Drop the top and sell crack wreckless
A loaded gun's cool, but yo I wanna own a judge too
A gun plus a judge equals blow me and fuck you
Get it where you fit in
Cause dummy recognize dummy
Pussy recognize pussy
And money recognize money
Gangsta recognize gangsta
And you faggets is funny
Tens years slangin' crack and you cats is still bummy
Whack rappers I be snatchin' your fade
Snathin' your chains, snatch up all your ice
Then empty my gat in your brain
You never heard of me?
Word, you cats is insane
Ill Bill motherfucker, dare to challenge the name
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Bless the Lord in heaven
Try to hijack a seven-forty-seven
A terrorist, hardcore forever
These other cats is makin' dance-music
My music make you bust gats to it
Shoot at your feet to make you dance to it
Bill's Ill, Bill smoke weed, Bill smoke blunts
Bill guzzle Hennessey and Bill smoke dust
Bill hates cops, still gots to get my props
Don't get too close because you might get shot
[Hook]

[Intro - Bizarre]
Reel Wolf, underground shit
I guess I'm up first, right?
I'mma rap first?
Alright, let me hit this blunt right quick
[Verse 1 - Bizarre]
I'm the sickest motherfucker on this earth
That'll fuck a transvestite, dog, or blue Smurf
Bizarre smack a bitch quick
Then give her ass and lick while she take a shit
Fuck your period, fuck your rag
Take it in your ass, just like a fag
All my fans is crazy, they love it
That's why I say fuck it, and smack you in public
I'm rugged!
[Verse 2 - Reef the Lost Cauze]
Yeah, you know me well
The Gods said that they owe me hell
I'm 
The Outlaw Josey Wales
Make a nigga feel spiritual like holy tales
From the bible, 
roll Exodus and then inhale
No one knows you, so if I kill you who’d I tell?
Half-hipster, whiney nigga that’s a fuckin' fail
Life without purpose, that’s a fucking jail
Lost Cauze, when I spit it’s fucking hell
[Verse 3 - Ill Bill]
Master a dance of lesbians
Satanic majesty's equestrian
On a black steed stampeding pedestrians
'Do what thou willt' shall be the whole of the law
I get my dick sucked by a nun with the soul of a whore
Superstitious like a gypsy casting a death-spell
Exhale 
chem-trails
Strangle you with your own entrails
14th day of July innocence was averted
Ill Bill, born on the same day Billy The Kid was murdered
[Verse 4 - Slaine]
It's kill or be killed
So watch out for the villain - he's ill
I'm slinging rap, 
swinging bats like I'm in little league still
Sniffing cocaine off a 
coin with Kennedy's grill
Cough from a joint while I'm crushing my enemies will
I'm a homicidal Hercules, doggie, I'm an urban myth
I swerve the whip, get my dick sucked while on my 
work release
I give these rappers bad advice and a nervous twitch
Penetrate and innovate, a renegade, I murder shit
[Hook]
I'm a real wolf
With the Underworld flick
[Verse 5 - Celph Titled]
I ain't racist just cause I
 
split your head to the white meat
The missing link Yeti-Sasquatch, yeah I might be
This shit's real - 
distribute guns in the kids meal
Open the box, hold the Glock, bust a shot through the windshield
The manifestation of evil stay alive and breathing
I'm Satan's fitness trainer,
 
exercising demons
Respect the shooter, I'll find the bastard
Hell, my loaded pistol is a fire hazard
[Verse 6 - King Gordy]
My dick stays hard in graveyards, you pray hard
As I make love to Adolf Hitler’s carcass
Call me a nigger as I lick his heartless chest
I guess these skinhead Nazis wanna get retarded
Why? Cuz I’m fucking your leader all in his ass
Speak to him in Hebrew
, fuck the Führer until he's back, dead again
Tell the Aryans I’m burying my head right in his belly
And it’s scary cause I'm licking his mustache
[Verse 7 - Sid]
Son of a killer, Mr. fucking grimey
SAS 22nd regiment limey
Born in a bar with my eyes wide open
Inspired by debacles since I came out the fallopian
We don't fuck around, got 
permits to carry
Everybody walks around like 
Dirty fucking Harry
Don't play my town, cause we will fucking bury you
Carry you to a farm cut off your arms, chewed up by animals
[Verse 8 - PMD]
On your mark, get set, ready to go
Green light, checkered flag, time to get that dough
And ayo, 
in the underworld I'm half-wolf and half-lycan
Swing the Excalibur, barbaric viking
[Verse 9 - Sean Strange]
Vicodin, marijuana, cocaine, the Grateful Dead
Average rapper kidnapping
Be sure to make your bed
When they battle me fatality take your head
And write a rhyme with your blood
The page's painted red
[Hook]
[Verse 10 - Apathy]
I'm the king of Castle Greyskull
My grey matter's powerful as 
Grey Hulk
I’m Zartan,
 
I’m Tarzan before he went to Greystroke
My brain's broke, slang dope
And when I speak, my slang's dope
You're soft as fuck - your whole album is a gay joke
Rap's lethal, spit a sixteen at you
We'll paint the ceiling with your brains
Like the Sistine Chapel
I'm the cardinal of carnage, the poisonous priest
Don't bother praying to your God
There's no avoiding this beast
[Verse 11 - Swifty McVay]
You ain't about that life
You a bastard that won't attack
I'm the type to grab a knife
And I'm stabbing you with it backwards
I'm backslapping wack ass non-rappers
Snatch the breath out of you faster than asthma without a gas mask
I lace hash, a heinous figure
Slash-murderer, I'm burning these legacy killers
Putting mo' metal in niggas than robotic mechanisms
Kill his woman and brag about it in prison
[Verse 12 - Vinnie Paz]
Rambo-knife, show you what bloody is
You call it a dead cop, I call it a bloody pig
You think your hands nice money? You's a funny kid
You next to get molly-whopped like your buddy did
The Ruger Blackhawk,
 
stick it in the dunny rib
Throw him in the fucking bathroom like Sunny did
The biggest show in your career; like a hundred kids
The AR-15
 
blew off like a hundred wigs
[Verse 13 - Tech N9ne]
Grim reaper to 
Ariel Castro, Adam Lanza, James Holmes
Flame on
, 
no it ain't wrong when I'mma have them plans for cancer
Then land ya in a hands up tense panthers
Damned with antlers to ram ya man pampers
Scrams the answer, No evil understands ya
Grandeur and like you were three times the word lambda
I’ll be the damper on a clan’s fam camper
Necromancer drinking vodka and Fanta with Santa
[Hook]

[Intro: Clip from Lady In The Water]
I tried to tell them about you, I don’t know if I did the right thing. I don’t know how they’re gonna react
[Verse 1:Apathy]
Keep the money coming, keep it so filthy
Keep your brain greedy, that’s how this world built me
Picture Genghis Khan, picture Megatron
Now picture BP, picture Exxon
Picture presidents, dead ones, alive ones
Black ones, white ones, devils in their eyes ones
Picture priests, picture the preacher, picture the prophet
Picture popes, picture police with padded pockets
Picture parents in a picture-perfect town with a pinch of pedophilia that tends to sneak around
Think of politicians, they making a killing
And then they wanna turn around and call me a villain?
Picture devils and demons with disguises
Smiling with eyes tatted on their closed eyelids
Picture handshakes that most never notice
The picture’s always been there, it’s simply how you focus
[Verse 2:Apathy]
This ain’t trap music, this ain’t frat music
It’s moshpit shit, get your skull cracked to it
This ain’t devil music, it’s just the study of
It ain’t the murder weapon but it’s the bloody glove
This is the thesis to show you who the beast is
The propaganda professors would never teach this
Picture people that will profit off religion
Now picture physicians who profit off certain prescriptions
Picture principals parent-teacher conference
ADHD and all that other nonsense
Psychologists will talk us out of all wisdom
While vaccine shots give children autism
Our community leaders mislead us
With laws that’ll take away our 9mm’s
Picture men who’ll say that they speak for Jesus
I’ll believe that shit when Hell freezes
[Verse 3:Ill Bill]
Lifers in the booth, 
snipers on the roof
Picture military personnel that like to shoot
Picture heroism, fill out your application
Picture terrorism, picture assassination
Picture pistols that pop instantly
Picture silencers that muffle the sound of gunshots efficiently
They say a picture’s worth a thousand words
Now picture a thousand pictures of a mushroom cloud about to burst
Picture cloudy skies on the day that Howie died
Picture metal detectors inside Canarsie High
Picture a newborn baby with the gas mask
Picture a New York skyscraper avalanche
A cameraman is kidnapped by the Taliban
Decapitated they sent his head into Pakistan
Picture the gruesome Twit videos and pics
Picture triple-six, picture the villain that live within
[Outro: Clip from Lady In The Water]
A boy in the Midwest of this land will grow up in a home where your book will be on the shelf and spoken of often. He will grow up
With these ideas in his head. He will grow into a great orator. He will speak and his words will be heard throughout this land and throughout the world. This boy will become leader of this country and begin a movement of great change.He will speak of you and your words. Your book will be the seeds of many of his great thoughts. It will be the seeds of change

[Verse 1: Ruste Juxx]
The ill diabolical fiend this mad scientist
Kill the cartel, rule the land with a iron fist
Ruste Juxx I be spitting that
Body new rappers, homie, watch who you getting at
Brrap, the bold cap snapback
I hit you with the brrat 'till your cap snap back
Further, knocking on them Pearly Gates
I'm organizing late funerals and early wakes
For any hot stepper trying to dance with the devil
Gravedigger, stand over your corpse with a shovel
Dropping dirt on it, fill it up then I'm out
They building something on the lands so now I gotta dig 'em out
Hoodfella, I rob for deniros
Too many lives lost for trying to be a hero
My patience is zero, I'm keeping it a hundred
Everytime I had a fight in my life I never fronted
I'm the realest
[Hook: Shabaam Sahdeeq]
Illest man walking, night of the living dead
Tombstone hopper, got a price on my head
Graveyard shipping, gotta keep the monsters fed
Things that go bumping at night, fool, you scared
I'm the illest man walking, night of the living dead
Tombstone hopper, got a price on my head
Graveyard shipping, gotta keep the monsters fed
Things that go bumping at night, fool, you scared
[Verse 2: Guilty Simpson]
I spit a murder verse scary as October 31st
House keeping, streets sweeping when doing my dirty work
Marijuana sparker, playing that drum like Travis Barker
Fam, I will valet park ya
Take your keys then get that cake before you leave
Gun talk, shooting the breeze
I put a popper to your chopper drop a hundred emcees
Hard ten below, but I spit the summer degrees
That mac wind made his hat spin
There's a million mad men in my trash bin
So when I buck at you bastards
Calm your frontline, and call it a muscle relaxer
Results of my violence is silence, we all can sleep
Me home, you six feet deep
Well-known heavy hitter, whoever want it
Everytime I step to the plate, I never bund it
I'm the illest
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
I'm a product of the projects, a menace to society
My consciense thinks progress but my greed thinks violently
Give me that, run that, kill me or I come back
Taking what I wanna take, homie, I'm a scumbag
So disrespectful I know my parents taught me better than that
But couldn't keep me away from felony rap
Not talking about music, this is felony robbery
Strong arm with the uzi, intercepting the economy
Touch down, get down clown, kiss the ground
And I'm too broke to own a silencer, homie, this is loud
Matter of fact, definetely, make your ears ring
Crazy you can get shot and not feel it at first, it's a weird thing
Pass out, wake up in the emergency room
With people you never met before nursing your wounds
Your little sister crying, doctors are inserting a tube
Down your throat, oh well, nothing personal dude
Bill is the illest
[Hook]

[Intro]
I get up, I go to my methadone program to get my meth
I drink my meth and I go make some money and go get
Whatever I can get high on. That's about it. fucking get high
What else is there?
[Hook]
This is who I am, this is what the world made me
I don't give a fuck whether you love me or hate me
I'm gonna die like that, forever at war
Hated by most, loved by few, respected by all
This is who I am, this is what the world made me
I don't give a fuck whether you love me or hate me
I'm gonna ride like that, forever at war
Hated by most, loved by few, respected by all
[Verse 1]
With everything you gain there's something you lose
You best be real clear on that, something you choose
Sometimes the most valuable things mean nothing to fools
And they don't want it til they see it means something to you
But you can't have what's mine, homie, get your own
Get the fuck out my face and stay in your lane
You ain't nothing like me, kid, we ain't the same
Get the fuck off my dick and stay in your lane
Old school like Power Play, lounging with Fatal
Nas
 rhyming in the lobby, 
Rakim
 in the A-room
Before Non Phixion
 I was up in Chung King
With 
Onyx
 and 
Jam Master J
 puffing the chronic
A good dude, rest in peace
RIP to big DS as well
, 
I'm a spark the L
Thinking about hard it was to come up in the game
Over twenty years I love it the same
Matter fact even love it more at the end of the day
Been wanting to work with 
Muggs
Since Cypress first dropped "Real Estate"
Now I'm doing what I want to do, 
La Coka Nostra
I won't stop til I'm on the wanted poster
Came a long way from talent shows with 
Black Moon
When Chuck Chillout was the manager for both of our groups
This is '92, I'm talking bout fifteen years ago
In the "Who Got The Props?" video
 with Gucci Rope
My world, my life's deep, you can't imagine
Crystalize torture, hatred in my soul like﻿ a cancer
Neither can be bought nor sold no matter the ransom
And neither truly exists without the other as the answer
Mankind so inherently evil
We made laws, religion, and jails simply to protect us from ourselves
Got too many cases, get arrested for robberies that I didn't do
My mugshot's in regular rotation
[Hook]
This is who I am
This is who I am

[Hook]
I found out that I was, too young, not grown
I was, not ready for a world so cold
I was, not prepared to make it on my own
I was, not ready for what life unfolds
And it was, too much, too soon
I couldn't, tell if what I felt was false or true
I didn't, think about what I'm about to do
I'm on some, this couldn't be real this can't be true
[Hero]
I was, too young but these my people so that's okay though
I was down for anything, I'd do it if they say so
Look how they cookin' it up, I'd sit and watch their cake grow
Watchin' Robbie in the corner, he there snortin' yayo
And everybody actin' cool like that right there's okay though
So I walk over to him, and I'm like yo hey bro'
What the fuck are you doin'? Get away from the table
He like, this ain't nothin' but a little bit of the yayo
I got it covered plus I make the profit from sales
He actin like he hadn't heard not one of them tales
The dopest brother, knocked him and they took him to jail
There go another this hustler here was destined to fail
Convicted, but the last I heard he tried to appeal
And Eric he gone he wildin', bustin' his steel off at the popo
These are the trial and tribulations, of kids tryin' to act like grown folks
[Hook]
[Ill Bill]
I was, too young to fall in love like Motley Crue
Too young, I pulled a gun and I shot this dude
It was over a girl, foolish pride, I was crucified
Just another youthful juvenile, doin' time
Forgive me mama, I never meant for you to cry
Went to trial, I was sent to do a two to five
Handcuffed in back of a bus, forty of us
Life as a shorty shouldn't be so rough
And I ain't no punk, here you fix your face or get your face fixed
Facelift, predicate cutter, you get you face ripped
They'll bust your shit wide open and make you leak
You better chill out, before I birthday cake your feet
Not a bad guy, I don't wanna catch mad time
So I chill with work release in the back of my mind
But the guy that I popped wasn't dead, he's locked up in here now too
And wants revenge, I got shanked in my bed
[Hook]
[Slaine]
I was too young to say no, too young to yell nope
Old enough to taste anger, but not enough to smell hope
Thirteen years old, my beloved mother had just passed
I started puffin' grass, drinkin' forties, cuttin' class
My father always used to beat on me and bust my ass repeatedly
I couldn't wait to get a change of scenery
I never had a dream, nobody believed in me
These mean streets are the only thing I've seen defeat
I'm sixteen bein' free, chewing vics and percs
Caught a OC habit quick, and my life got worse
Cause now I'm sick unless I get a pill, so my head is filled
With deep schemes my tolerance I let it build
But when street dreams and quick cash is difficult
You find you get the same high cheap from sniffin' dope
Now I'm shootin with the neighborhood people
Nobody could save me from evil, I'm a slave to the needle! ..I'm too young!
[Hook x2]

[Ill Bill]
We them trouble shooters in bubblegooses, hit you with double Rugers
Son we ruthless, guns and goon flicks, we run this goon shit
Slit your throat and fuck you with pool sticks, too sick
Super gruesome, intrusive and abusive, shoot you with uzis
Ill Bill, cult leader, a/k/a the ultimate assassin
Show you how to turn a broken cell phone into a ratchet
Veterans of stone, venomous and cold
Terrorists with messengers of chrome, settlements explode
Apocalyptic face off, Babel to Bilderberg, witch's curse
Pistols burst, incestuous sisters flirt
Seduce you in Lucifer's church, crucify you, kiss the dirt
Information is power, now put that shit to work; let the light be revealed
From the 
Triple Stage Darkness
 to 
the Seven Seals
Ebbets Field, forever real, rebels kill
Devil's fill your glass with forbidden fruit
Hidden truth
Vikings drink blood, gangsters drink gin and juice
I'm surrounded by preachers of porn, preachers of war, leaches and whores
Billionaires with features in 
Forbes
, the creeps and the crawls
Reaching across to touch my enemies with a sword
Put them in they place, represent the deceased with a corpse
With a silver dollar left behind to lay on his eyes
For the boatman at the river Styx to pay for his ride
Saudi businessmen front terror from their American summer homes
While W lay nude in a coffin for Skull and Bones
Undertones never dumb though, he played the villain
Dumber people think you are
The more surprised they are when you kill them
[Sick Jacken]
A never-ending war descending us all, epitome of enemy brawls
Send you to Hell and through heavenly doors
Lebanese arms to sever the devil, heavenly cause
The deadly spar, immortalized in felony bars
The melody's dark cause of the death metal he brought
And caused by total meth bark, of seventeen blunts
Yeah the streets got a, lot of heart and soul and the Sicksider
Make the block hotter than Hell fuckin with my mind
It's not a game, the Sick and Infamous is born insane
You do it wrong and they respond with pain
Heroin vein, the pigs stink they're all the same
Homeland terror got named, the federal came
So it's troubleshoot, reprogram cannons to damage jaws
Banned hammers from shooting bandanas and camouflage
We killed the man for status, or dead president mathematics
And now we shake the fans tryin to get at it
[Sean Price]
I was a small crack packin to the wall jack macking
All swollen on parole, now I'm back black rapping
Soon as I came home I went to my man crib
He give me a quarter brick - get it how you live
Momma I want to sing, momma I got to sling
Delaware trips made a nigga feel like a king
Bling bling, karats on my neck now
Carrots in the cup after doing ten sets
Been fresh since Brandy was fuckin with Ronday
And brown Macy bags used to cover the Con-way
Matter fact boom now look whom fuckin with Charlene
I wrote my first rhyme and since then every bar's mean
Sean Price, the best rapper in New York
And plus 49 states, nigga my rhyme great
Primate, Sean Don Cornelius
It's maximum stupidity, par mall silliest
My gift of gab is a gift from God
I will, get you stabbed and get you robbed
P~!
[O.C.]
On wrong, four-four long
Sean Price didn't give it as a gift on some Brooklyn shit
Cracked the box with Gemstar then tossed the ox
Slip on my Nike Shox, snatch a Guinness from icebox
Michael Jai White, felony spawn, hell if I'm gone
Fuck atonement for my sins, enemies I'm comin for 'em
On the run like Lucas, preventin niggas from reproducin
Heirs to thrones so I cut short your feature
"Soliloquies of Chaos," trouble shooters what they are
Bill sends you commission for facilitatin the seance
My mans Sick guardin corridor two
These +Game of Death+ levels does not include Bruce
One thing fo' sho' is a foot in the chest
Like Abdul Jabbar, black shades, arms crossed
So goes the process of elimination
Bound, gagged, and wired up for detonation
{*explosion, glass shattering*}

[Ill Bill]
The motherfucking cult leader is back
The hour of reprisal is here
Billy Idol put the nine to your ear
The all-time grimiest, I'm the nuclear truth
I let black market plutonium loose in the booth
My beats kick you dead in your face, loosen your tooth
I'll be creeping up on you like a deuce-deuce in a boot
Trust nobody, homeboys will change on you
Stab you in the back, pull the twelve gauge on you
I've been involved in epic battles and holy wars
No remorse, quiet money, private benjamins like Goldie Hawn
Most religions sleep underneath a soldier's corpse
Chopped them in half, used them a source of warmth
Seven eyes, seven horns, secret wars
Jesus walks across troubled water bleeding from his palms
His feet, eyes, ears, nose, his crown, his mouth
Eventually stopped talking when they cut his tongue out
[Hook 2x]
Trust nobody, no way, no how, never
Trust nobody, no shit, homie, don't you ever
Trust nobody, no way, no how, never
Trust nobody, trust nobody
[Ill Bill]
The person you least expected to cut your throat
Will be the first creep directing a gun at your dome
I've seen brother kill brother for the love of the dollar
They turned snakes on each other like my mother and father
I beat everything, every angle, every agenda
Many pretenders attempt to enter my presence
And test the intelligence level
Remove the head of the devil, I don't even trust God
I think I'm going to hell
It's a cold world, I don't trust religion
I don't trust the police nor the justice system
I don't like doctors, lawyers, or politicians
I don't like liars it was deception that ruined Non Phixion
I pray for peace but always stay prepared for war
Destroy you if you push me up against the wall
I seen it all, everyone of y'all love to conduct schemes
Trust nobody, homie, don't even trust me
[Hook 2x]

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I seen it all
From what the truth should be, to what the truth is
As we evolve from what we used to be onto some new shit
Rewrite the blueprint, with 
true grit
Students of moving bricks and full clips
Or otherwise we just threw fists
Been 
breaking bad
, 
ever since before I became a dad, or made in in rap
In truth, I still cater to that
Root for the villain getting paid in full
Spraying the gat on the roof of my building
Getting brain, taking it back
I was that projects professor
A white kid digesting Five Percenter lessons
I copped from the brother selling incense
Extensively, studied Rakim and all the emcees
Eventually discovered I spit rather intensely
Now here I am, speaking to everybody that be listening
The hardcore hiphop with heart, like nitroglycerin
The type of rap you feel in your cardiac
That grimy, illmatical boom bap - mathematical goon rap
[Hook]
Check one-two, one-two
[Verse 2]
Ayo, I rise and laugh at the lies, analyzing the science of things
In the land of the blind
, the man with one eye is the king
The path of the divine crash into gunfire and brimstone
Adapt to survive - the spilled blood dries when the wind blows
Look to the past, see your future staring back at you
Holdin' a gat, holdin' you back
And bearing ample fruit and opportunity
Get in where the fuck you fit in with unity
We stand tall - what the fuck could you do to the assault literary?
Slaughtercult military - Necronomicon Don
Occult visionary
Conspiracy host behold secret mystery scrolls
Seen black satanic lesbian titties explode
Fuck livin' on your knees, I'd rather die on my feet
Rise in the street, fistfights with riot police
These lines I wrote potent like lines of coke
A kaleidoscope of the violent prone
That's just me on the beat by Pete Rock n roll
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The excellence and inspiration of truth, is the pursuit
It's like an exercise for the mind
Like a 
nine
 when it shoots
Testify with lies implied beside a mountain of proof
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, many have died for the fruit
Organic and natural, harvested from off the vine
Of verified indisputable factual and actual
The only sure thing in life is death, shooters and bricks
Coca pure, sniff white, respect Lucifer's gift
Death is only the beginning,
 heads exploding and spinning
Like The Exorcist possession
Unholy and grinning
Tell 'em Welcome to hell, enter the ceremony of winning
Where I'm from sharks fly and the vultures are swimming
The truth is gang raped while the world watches it horrorified
Compulsively taped with flip cams then watch it tomorrow high
Shoot it like Columbine
Edit it and upload, then YouTube it online for derelicts and cutthroats

[Ill Bill]
I sent you all to Satan
Sent you to the devil, decapitated
Splattered, degraded
Rather amazing matters of hatred
Manifestation
The cannibal data related to random standards in cases
Fuckin' faggots stabbed in they faces
Buckets of acid
Hitchhike with truckers in traffic
I'm stuck on a path where the outcome is nothing but tragic
My outward appearance is nothing but average
Inside of my brain structrure the primary function is madness
Torture these traitors
Put their blow torches to faces
Corpses in my basement
Torsoes are my favorite
Autopsy's invigorating
Killing you is refreshling and liberating
Playing with the dead is extensively titilating
Humans are extremely expensive but really tasty
Sell you on the Black Market in pieces to anybody who pays me
Limited quantity
Culinary sodomy
Unique cuisine, delicacy
The ultimate equality
[Necro]
I'm Ogrish
As vulgar as you can get
Cut out your vulva
My cult of the dead
Eats from your skull
Pulverize like a vulture's molars
My goal is dicing up Cindy Margolis
And placing her flesh on slices and servin' you hemoglobinisis
Its priceless
I'm savage, artistic like the vampire of Paris
Sadistic
Start a campfire
Reminisce of massacres lifted
Blast through a pillow
I'm a sick bastard like Andre Chikatilo
Slay the padre
Watch the silhouette of a killer glow
Dusted like Repka's artwork
Like Carcass' "Heartwork"
Like an aardvark searchin' through organs like carparts rockin' a Cardhardt
Ritual sacrifice is human appetizers
I capitilize on this cannibalism violence advertisements
My cypher of tyrants are trifer than pirates
Like lifers that killed wifey with knives
A violent viking's in Ice Age
Smacking Satan
Invading your crib like Patrick Bateman
With a hatchet waiting making a theatric statement
[Goretex]
They call me Fondlecorpse
Cater for every occasion
Home invasion
Cavin' in brains
That's what I call entertainment
Anachronistic
Wit' two biscuits that clip through your discus
The gore grinder
Cause I'm down to the last 6 on my hit-list
I'm a sick kid
Pieces of skull and blood on my ticksis
Too much brown acid
Used to be in love with the business of killings
This vision is scalvaged for nothing
Venison victim
Buried face down
You're similar to a faggot who takes it in him
Basically a waste of skin
I've returned and sent him a telegram
A body count with two legs
Shattered next to the hexagram
My ??
I make like squeaky and stab it
My circle fam is supreme bandits
Murdered like speed handlers
Dirt on the canvas
Torso fuck shorter than Danzig
Saw off your legs and walk on your hands like you was dancin'
March of the pigs
Newest shipments
Cartons and wigs
The killer's smile
You know the symptoms when the coughing begins
[Mr. Hyde]
The prince of evil erupts
Cut you cunts into cutlets
You fuckin' faggot punks
A bunch of sluts that'll suck dick
We bust clips at cops
And trust kids with Glocks
We'll thrust in the ox of puss, drips and drops
Rockin' bloody bone chains and veins
My cult's strange
Known to indulge in pain
Crack skulls, expose brains
While God's forsaken me there's carcass cooking in my bakery
Scraping off your skin and string it up my wall as drapery
Dramatically battering you
Emphatically splattering you
Sporadically ravaging like a scavanger do
Sharpen claws
Ripped and tore your shit
You're dead and sure to twitch, bitch
Your blood and piss is pouring out of every orifice
Corpse grisly and grim
I use my scissors to trim
The blue corset from the host
As I efficiently skin
Spin the record around
I chop your ventricles down
You'll see my tentacles found you
Now you enter the ground

I put the motherfucking gangsta in the game
Destroy you like cancer of the brain
I can't be stopped
I'm faster than the plane that crashed into the trade center
Brain bending pain enter ya nervous system and make you wanna turn the other way
Stick yo fucking head in the dirt, don't even look in my direction
You define trash, I personify perfection
High beeming on the highway driving benzes
Crime scene looking like a homicide convention
You walk around with a dick in your mouth
Dont ever let the kid joe take a shit in your house
Trust my judgement, I make bitches lie to their husbands
At my crib on the cell phone crying they love them
Nobody's fault, its all good as long as nobody's caught
Jealousy, put bodys in morgues
Hungry for money and coke, put hotties in porn
Won't stop till I put Uncle Howie in forbes
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
I've had my, ups and downs, dealt with cunts and clowns
Major label deals I've been fucked around
Spent years money dangling in front of my face
Instead of blowing the spot, bill was running the place
Payed mad dues, shows, made hundreds of tapes
Sold drugs studio time my gun in your face
Look at me now, 
Non-Phixion
 running the game
Kings of the underground and we loving it man
Yea Ill punch you in your face when Im out on tour
When we was with the beatnuts, I could count about four
Different occasions I had to lace a kid, cold duffed em
One dude bought me a drink after I snuffed em
Promoters talk out the side of they mouth
Till they spitted they own teeth out the side of they mouth
Even the bouncers was scared of us, Calling for peace
While the fagget that got his head cracked, called the police
Ill Bill be the mother fuckin future, its easy to tell
Fuck wit me, I'm a see you in hell
So don't fuck wit a bull, achieve the impossible
Cause there ain't no stopping the unstoppable
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
I found your lack of faith disturbing, 
now my aquisitions are merging
Streets are your, executions are murders,
 these goons will worship
Like methological gods, beating impossible odds
Comparable in the hood to killing thousands of cops
Pass the good in the bag, take it straight to the ugly
Made in New York, it spread now we raping the country
Stay with the vest, triple x pistols and sex
Money and murderers connect, equals instant success
Ripple effect, we invest, legitimate businessmen
Court rooms to ball rooms expanding the business plan
Listen man, I'm old fashioned
Fuck taking over answer, kidnap the family and hold em for ransom
We getting dough ya'll, its the jump off
Either you get with us or fuck off
An unstoppable force on a rough course
Big success, fuck with me you fucking wit the best
Fuck who's on top, cause I'm a lot hungrier than them
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now
No matter how hard you try, can't stop me now

What up Skizz?
[Verse 1: Lil' Fame]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died you probably vision me shot up
And laying on the stretcher
Cause I ain't the nigga that die from high blood pressure
My demise in the midst of a crime go fresher
Look at his eyes he's ready to die, Lord bless him
It is what it’s gonna be, ain't much that worry me
Can’t care whether is 20 of us or one of me
Gun boys ride with us, 
niggas still get yapped
Pistol whiped on all monitors, you know what time it is
Low nigga run up, squeeze a couple shots in your shirt
Touch your best out to see if it work (Brang! Brang!)
My niggas get high, get drunk, go ape
Whoop you out for about 20 minutes straight then we rotate
Straight put the beats on em, no brakes
Since way back in the days, nigga's name hold weight
And we still active, still mashin'
Still inspiring, still shining, still firing
[Hook: Lil' Fame]
Violence is a universal language
Nah nigga you done pick the wrong nigga to bang with
(Brang-brang!) We murder ya
BK nigga get down, the dirtiest, we bang
We give 'em the whole thang!
[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You probably picture a hollow bursting out of a nine
And splattered me when it popped, jerked me out of my prime
My fam'll be mad of God, cursing out of the sky
If violence be gets violence and death rules everything around me
Dreams are really nightmares, in King’s County
And even though my daughter was born here
Slaughter and war go on here
You'll get your fucking wig blown off here
Let's put the mirror to the violence, an electrify spirit
That defines visionary riots, military science, dignitary silence
Ambassadors are assassinated
From the war-room to the block assassinations are created
Murders are premeditated and orchestrated by a symphony conductor
Sort of when sawed-offs are spraying
The rhythm of the gun shots is like a song is playing
Speaking in the same tongue to God like to talk to Satan
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Shabazz The Disciple]
I'm from where the murderers ride
If you heard that I died
You’d probably picture me slumped over the wheel in my ride
Drugs planted in the trunk, being accused of a crime
Orchestrated by COINTELPRO the FBI
? all on the dashboard, cause my spirits to fly
Wanna see me scalpel ride?? filled with formaldehyde
Police the modern day romans, stolen profits with nines
Like the prophets in black, leaders of what they prophesized
Hood Christ crucified, two G’s on my side
My peter’s heater a sly, cause my Judas demise
I pray I look my angel of death right in his eyes
You coming with me motherfucker, finish this beef in the sky
These last earth memories, the sight was frightening
Hear thunder when the hood Christ, striked the lightning
Ain’t no fuckin hail Mary’s, is hail of slugs
Brain dead on your deathbed, family pull the plug
[Hook]

(ILL BILL)
ILL BILL and Sicknature spit hatred
All these other cats are dick faces
I lift trains and throw 'em at airplanes
Spit flame - switch lanes - my fist make chins ache and my spit could even strip paint
I think great like Alexander
Stop you in your tracks like a fam of tarantulas crawling up your pants like they mad at ya
Crawl in ya mouth, try to spit em out, crawl in ya eyes
Immortalize, get the blow torch, cauterize
Torture minds, lord of lies, kingdom of truth
I sound like someone tossed a thermite grenade in the booth
Stomp ya head flat, penetrate ya brain with a boot, ya skull with ya teeth
Roll with thugs, vultures and creeps
Third eye wide open while your soldiers asleep
Burst nines watch ya whole team explode in the street
It's the code of the street
Here's an award
Fry the umpire
Live by the sword
You'll probably die by gunfire
(Chorus)
(Sicknature)
My rap is like katanas, severing heads in a splatter
On beats colder than the era that buried the mammoth
Spit magma like volcanoes that erupt
And bring a divine pain like the hammer of Thor landed in your nuts
Smashing them to dust, when Bill & Paz is on the cut
You´ll feel like ya dived in a tub with a high voltage gadget while its plugged
If you´ll snooze on this heavy weight greatness, best stay awake then
Like having sexomnia next an AIDS patient
All that happy rapping is dead
My shit sounds like chopping off an entire kneck to play hackey sack with the head
Crucial rage music, with a mood that would slay cupid
I never kicked in the door, I bazooka´d my way through it
Me & Bill produced Seven for Army Of The Pharaohs
And threw these shit producers a party in the gallows
We´re an alliance that solidly silence the comedies
Spit is wild, a clear reflection of a violent society
(Chorus)
(Vinnie Paz)
I'm only here for the money dummy get it and leave
Ain't no second chances here you don't get a reprieve
You better off murkin yourself or catch a disease
Cause fuckin round with Vinnie you ain't destined to breath
So whether if it's violence or a question of peace
I don't give a muthafuck you getting fed to the beast
I use ya warm blood turn it from the bread to the yeast
Walk into the tabernacle take the head of a priest
I carry heavy shit let the thunderclapper blam
Like Mitch Blood Green beat in front of Dapper Dan
It's only darkness when you go for the assassins hand
Don't even speak to me without the use of proper gram
You a shook one pissin in ya dungarees
When you rhymin on stage it's only tumbleweeds
I'm a death stalker yall are fuckin bumblebees
You betta bacdafucup like you was Sonny Seez
(Chorus)

(Verse 1: Slaine)
Oh I'm in love with the drugs, I'm in love with the women
I've got "
Drugs, Money, Sex.
" tattooed on my arm and I take it from coast to coast
Yeah, this time is really rainin' on me, I've got no cover
The only one who thinks I'm handsome is my own mother
The street game is a bitch and I don't love her
When you dope they jones so I keep my poems gutter
I speak clearly into mics and I don't stutter
These other clowns talk loud and they won't shut up
I have declared war therefore from here on
There ain't no army that can attack that I ain't prepared for
I am in rare form, scarin' the norm
All night long 'til I disappear in the dawn
In between heaven and hell, my spirit is torn
Between the Virgin Mary and fly hookers wearing a thong
I'm on so many drugs that my eyes are blurry
But they still can't hide or disguise my fury
He who lives life slow will die in a hurry
Live by the gun, you fire in a violent flurry
(Chorus)
We're livin' in a violent time and my eyes designed for crime
We kill for a nickel or dime and there ain't no way you can 
vic
 me for mine cause I'm
Livin' in a violent time and my eyes designed for crime
We kill for a nickel or dime and there ain't no way you can vic me for mine
(Verse 2: Sick Jacken)
Well underground like the freedom movement
See our car in the street, salute it
These are bars from the psycho unit
We stay strong despite the lack of union
Cops throw us in the jail like the 
camps in Munich
Exiled in the palace of the most polluted
Fallen stars from ghetto spars and block shootings
Another soldier taken away to stop you and us from improving
It almost seems 
change is just an illusion
I'm losing my life before my pride
I'm a student of the revolution
Put me in a noose if I'm a nuisance
Give me a truce or get strong abuse from troops
That wanna break loose from the force you're using
We're rebelling in the form of music
Speak truth and I hope you use it
It's a sore world how Bush views it
We gotta take the power back and get through this
If not, there's no future for our kids, get to it
(Chorus)
(Verse 3: Ill Bill)
It was the first robbery of 2006
Banana clips, a couple cops got shot
Listen to the sound of the police when the bullet rips through his knot
You hear nothing, just another tear drop in the plot
Another kid gets killed by a stray bullet
Another grandmother cries in the pulpit
It's bullshit, we need more justice of the people
Yet we sell drugs even though we know it's evil
It's a way lot more complicated than that
And that's why half the projects gravitated to crack
Nowdays the hustle game is all fucked up
Have you up state, doing 15 years for nothing
Not guilty were the first ones with good alibies
Cops is pissed, they got the whole hood paralyzed
Fuck all of y'all, prosecutors never can hurt me
Cause I've got big retainers with the best attorneys
(Chorus)

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
They killed my entire family
Murdered and tortured, raped and pillaged
I was only five and I was the only surviving witness
My entire village burnt to the ground
He wore a 
serpent in his crown
Happily committed murder with a frown
In an army of black-hooded fiery-skulled generals
And a sorcerer that could cast spells that’ll change your genitals
Held me in slavery till I turned eighteen
Killed my slave master, five years later became king
And I slain dragons and ate steaks during famine
Had the seeds of war planted in a dirty tavern
Had the seeds of presidents killed in a burst of anger
And 
had their parents bleed to death on the floor of a dirty bathroom
I watched their palaces burn, I seen the ashes of my comrades
Returned to their family in an urn
While a proud child remembers his father that died
The cycle continues with vengeance alive in his mind
[Hook: 
Max Cavalera
]
Refuse, resist, war is my destiny
!
Desire unleashed, war is my destiny!
Chaos, A.D
., war is my destiny!
Under a pale grey sky, war is my destiny!
[Verse 2: Immortal Technique]
Yeah
, yeah, I was an angel before a third of the stars fell
Cast with the sternum from Satan into the pit of hell
Our beloved leader forced to be a bottom-feeder
The great deceiver that promised victory over 
the monkey lovers
We took a vote to restructure and traitors fell upon him
We ripped his skin off and crowned a new son in the morning
A new president to lead our corporation
The vengeance on God and Heaven’s domination
But I seduced the daughters of man and made the 
Nephilim
I demanded human sacrifice from the rest of them
I became the spirit that tortured and protected them
And I built them the tower of language that connected them
And then the Lord cried, water falling out from his eyes
And my children died drowning in the tears from the sky
And it was then that Satan crawled back to me with a plan
A design for the ultimate corruption of man
See back then we used to set the chosen ones on fire
You really think God only sent a single messiah?
And so we allowed the birth of many prophets on earth
And since the followers were human they were born with a curse
They began to claim superiority to their brothers
And for eighty-five thousand years conquered each other
And when they 
prayed before battle they were praying to me
Killing in God’s name cause war is my destiny!
[Hook]

[Hook - repeat 2X]
Tell me where the fuck I went wrong?
Took the wrong turn, wrong path
What's Wrong With Bill? - Inspired by swords to kill
Coldhearted, 
how can a person be taught to feel?
Thoughts concealed by shield of alcohol and pills
[Verse 1]
God is an atheist
, why should I believe in religion?
I'd rather get my dick sucked and 
cook ki's in the kitchen
Drive-by, leave you on your block bleeding and twitching
Break bread with demons and witches, I'm evil and twisted
Half of us in jail, the other half in Beemers and Sixes
CEOs wondering who let these creeps in the business
Creep with the biscuit, I'm heroin the fiends are addicted
Life's the American Nightmare - the dreams of the wicked
We cry blood, sniff cocaine and die young
Time's up, caught up in the blowjobs and mindfucks
The metal that killed my enemies, occupy guns
Say goodbye cause you only die once
My mind's grotesque, it's so ugly, so focused, so hungry
Trust me, young Gene Simmons, getting between women
Ill Bill - solo album, Howie gon' take it
Leave you duct taped and stuck in the Matrix
[Hook - repeat 2X]
[Verse 2]
Two women love me, one gave birth to me, nurtures me
The other one don't understand me
Sometimes she wanna murder me, sometimes she wanna marry me
I pray that my sanity grab me, it ground me
I think that I'm about to go AWOL, lose my shit
As reality slips away I'm starting to lose my grip
No smile is genuine or real
I find myself losing faith in every thing and every person that I hold dear
I'm in a bad place, who do I trust?
I don't trust myself, how the fuck I'm gonna trust you?
If I don't love myself how the fuck I'm gonna love you?
I made this album to reveal my inner thoughts and discuss truth
What does life mean without death?
Would you appreciate the sunlight without the darkness?
Would I appreciate my grandmother raising me if she had never passed away
So many things I never had the chance to say when she was here
I see you when I get there
I 
hope that there's a heaven even though I know I'll probably burn in hell
, I lived there
It couldn't get much worse I guess
Suicidal thoughts, I think that I've become obsessed with death
And I know it's fucked up, but yo I'm trying hard so get the fuck out my face
I'll work it out myself, it's my problem, I'll solve it
Picking up the pieces of a life shattered
I never knew my life mattered
[Hook - repeat 2X]

[Verse 1]
I left you outside the gates of heaven - They wouldn't let me in
I waved goodbye as you stepped within
It's like hell on earth without you near
I named my daughter after you
So when she smiles it's sorta like you're still here
It's kinda crazy how time flies - 25 years since my grandmom died
But it feels like just yesterday when we was all laughing together
Those happy memories are so vivid, they'll last me forever
And yet you're still here somehow - I still feel your presence
I credit you for my inner strength - I feel it in my essense
In my soul, in my inner being, in my genetics
I wouldn't exist if you hadn't persisted through the trenches
I wouldn't have been a lyricist, I owe you every sentence
Every verse I've ever written -
 
Your energy is kinetic
Though I've grown up, I'm still heartbroken, aching to cry
Hoping you're the one holding open those gates when I die
[Verse 2]
I left you outside the gates of heaven - They wouldn't let me in
I waved goodbye as you stepped within
It's like hell on earth without you near
I named my label after you
So when I rhyme it's sorta like you're still here
It's been a year - 
Still in shock about exactly what happened to you
Made a song for you called "My Uncle"
I was just rapping to you, just talking to you
I just saw you at my mother's house
I can't believe I just bought a coffin for you
We always feared that you would die from an overdose
God knows you loved to do drugs, it swallowed you whole
But in the end, drugs didn't kill you, cancer did
Why do good people die young? I don't know what the answer is
All I know is I worshipped you as a scrappy kid
Being around you made me feel cooler than rapping did
& that's pretty fuckin cool, trust me
I was embarrassed when you started smoking crack
Honestly, it crushed me - Swept in under the rug
Started smoking weed & popping acid but managed to not do the uglier drugs
We grew apart after my grandmother died
Homeless, in and outta jail, we stopped relating to each others lives
But years later, we connected once again
Not just as nephew and uncle, but as homies, we were friends
Though I've grown up, I'm still heartbroken, aching to cry
Hoping you're the one holding open those gates when I die

(Verse 1: Ill Bill)
I shoot you out your body
Perform a seance with a fucking shotty
I wear a ski mask so that nobody identify me
Grimey and grizzily, throw you to the pitbulls like a frisbee
Then feed the pieces of you that they bring me
Baby, your arm, leg, leg, arm, and your head
Even God turned his back on you, holmie, you're dead
Just a fragment of your former possibilities and aspirations
A casualty in the civil war of a gangster nation
My generals pocket death to millions
The media spread lies and cash cheques for trillions
I organize crime, money and murder synchronize beyond time
I move mountain tops without trying
I move buildings like super villains
Throw penthouses of people and fist fuck porno movie bitches
Like Bang Brothers dot com, got money in my palm
No love, no smiles, ain't nothing funny, y'all
(Chorus)
I come from where hope goes to die
Where dreams get crushed and the bullets fly
I come from where hope goes to die
La Coka Nostra till I die
(Verse 2: Everlast)
Peckerwood b-boy in the white man's stance
Where I come from, son, 
the wolves don't dance
They stand with their fists and talk shit like this
Y'all don't want drama, y'all don't want static
You fiend like crack addicts, comeback's automatic
Got a douce-douce in my boot holdin' five
Got a razor in the other one in case you survive
I rep the Gaza Strip, the hunger strike
Cousin, bite on your lip, do what you like
We ain't playin' no games, you ain't honky-honk
When the cats with the guns pop the trunks and dump
And the pistols thump and the bodies slump
Goin' for Jihad, can't wait to see God
A child of the city so my attitude's shitty
The livest type bomber out for pure drama
Period, comma, P.S. fuck your momma
(Chorus)
(Verse 3: Slaine)
I'm the white guy who gave the whole rap game a black eye
Fuck your bitch with a dick thicker than Shaq's thigh
You can't nod off, this is a crack high
Stab you in your fucking face with a jack knife
I love bitches who suck dick and half-dyke
I'm just sick, I'll beat your brain, doc, with a flashlight
A black mag lite, you other rappers fag fight
We don't battle, I have your family crawlin' up the bagpipes
And the preachers preach, pine box in the fucking facial features fixed
Whoops, I mean fixed, push don't mean shit
When a dope fiend lean on a custom green whip
Everlast, Ill Bill, Slaine, and D-Boy, Lethal, Left Cage
We got you ?
We b-boys who destroy on both coasts
Tote toasts and sold coke with gold ropes
(Chorus)

Hip Hop brought cultures together
I remember cugines in camaros pumping "Tougher Than Leather"
Yankel Rosenbaum still got stabbed in Crown Heights
Gavin Cato got hit when they ran that red light
Over a decade of healing but the scars remain
Both families involved still harbor the pain
Age 13 - 70's baby raised in the 80's
Mad fights with blacks and whites
And both sides hated me for nonsense
The white kids was playin it wack
Cos I'm from the projects and my neighbors is black
I had to prove whiteboys could thump too
But fuck skin color - I was proud to call myself a tough jew
I guess I'm mad lucky to be raised in NY
The world's capitol
 - 
my attitude was take em to war
Other places would've raised me in a useless format
In Texas they dream about hunting jews with Borat
[Hook]
Call me white 
nigger
Call me christ killer or kike
Call me nigger lover
Because I spit on the mic
Think you got me figured out
You're not listening right
Get ya fuckin head kicked in for thinkin you're hype
They call me white nigger
Call me every name in the book
I done heard em all
Fuck ya'll - I made it a hook
Made it a song
Exposing the hatred to all
Cos any type of racism is wrong
Had newsmen talking as a kid about Yusef Hawkins
Same age as me when Joey Fama caught him walking through Bensonhurst
A world away from my Glenwood Projects
Racially mixed - combustible - it lead to conflicts
I was never raised prejudice
My grandmother was a holocaust survivor
And my uncle did heroin
My pops wasn't around
My moms kicked him out the house
And broke her back to put food in our mouths
Age 12 - they bussed my projects to the white school
Holes in my sneakers - I never fit in with them rich white dudes
I didn't click up with the blacks kids neither
 - I bought a 
Iron Maiden
T-shirt and wrote rhymes in my trapper keeper
[Hook]
Run-D.M.C. really made me wanna get wreck
Same time 
Kerry King
 played guitar for 
Megadeth
It was 84, 85 - LL Cool J "rock the bells"
Obliterated my mind - so inspired I created a rhyme
Beastie Boys on U68 - "she's on it" made up my mind
Hardcore - the other bright side
I thought Bad Brains was white guys
 
when Melle Mel dropped "White Lines"
Nazi skinheads showed up at Lamour's in Brooklyn
Got stabbed up by puerto rican skins from Bushwick
Geraldo got his nose broken - Tawana Brawley on Donahue
Central Park wildin had the world scopin
Now VH1 got a show for wiggers
And some claim the jews be the biggest wiggers
 - 
we're considered
The most dangerous cause they think we shift our forms
Cast spells & wear beanies to restrict our horns from being seen
Growing out our heads - the killers of christ
These fools wear white sheets and believe that hitler was right
Believe it or not they still exist undercover
And Mel Gibson never liked Danny Glover
Another piece of shit called out in the paper - 
if we was there
Me and my peoples would have beat the fuckin shit outta Kramer
If this song offends you, you're a hater - take a look within yourself
And figure out what the fuck you're afraid of
[Hook]

Frank Zito

[Hook - Necro]
White slavery when bitches get put under seige
Shoved into a van and kidnapped right from the street
Never to be seen again by any of their peeps
Just a victim buried deep in the world of creeps
Who roam through alleyways associating with freaks
You'll never be found but cops will be searching for weeks
Looking for leaks, hoping somebody speaks
While your brain is washed and your memory they delete
[Verse 1 - Ill Bill]
Women need to be loved, injected with needles and drugs
Subjected to torture and kidnapped they need to succumb
It's proven, I feed em dog food, they prefer human
Make 'em savagely beat each other bloody for my amusement
It's all fun and games, I keep 'em handcuffed in chains
Sexually make 'em do the most disgusting things
Starve 'em to cannibals, make 'em eat each others' brains
Changed and deranged, stores begin to seem like nothings strange
While retarded acquaintances get fist fucked and raped
Covered in lighter fluid, lit up and engulfed in flames
Sound proof walls guarantee to muffle your screams
Squirm on a shit stained mattress in a puddle of pee
Selling you to the highest bidder for a bundle of D
And I'mma be a scumbag till I'm a hundred and three
Throw you in the back of a van, rag stuck in ya teeth
Smothered in chloroform, you wake up smothered in creeps
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Necro]
I'm enslaving women from Ukraine, they don't understand English
But they understand pain, It's the language of anguish
Your situation's hopeless, deceived into dancing topless
Then force you into prostitution with coke heads
Police keep the silence while you sleep with clients
You protest you won't eat and you get beat like a child does
And when you're destroyed like women from Latvia
You'll be sold to the Muslim part of Bosnia by the mafia
From where there is no return forever
You'll be on ya knees labeled a coffee table in leather
We have no hearts with mafiosi, 
evil like Bela Lugosi
White slavery O.G.'s that own police
Full of hate, Spanish midgets pull you out of crates
Kidnapped women dangled from chains; their fate: to be raped
Killers with Frank Zito cuts deliver slaves in vans
From Iran that's delicacy like a gorilla's liver
Like the stench of a roach
We'll bring it to you critics fowl like a blowgun
And a naked chick in a trenchcoat
Chopping your feet of, don't shut the beat off
Leave it, believe it we're coming to cut the meat off
And meat cleave it

[Primo Scratching]:
"This a world premier"
"Ill Bill"
"Well then you just sit back and listen because I have a story for you."
[Verse One]:
It was a commercial on the DNA & Hank Love show
If you was there you know about the Little Rascal Studio
In Jamaica Queens, hot to death, dude was a clown
But back then it was prolly the cheapest studio in town
I went from watchin' Video Music Box with Ralph McDaniels
To rockin' 30,000 people surrounded by cameras
First rhyme in '82, first band in '87
First time we played as crew I doubt it was very impressive
But we kept on practicin' and we got better with time
Practice makes everything perfect, I'm in my veteran prime
And it's bigger than hip hop or being clever with rhymes
Cause I actually feed my seed with these endeavors of mine
And it's taken me around the world several times, it's crazy
It’s crazy what hard work & being focused can achieve, it’s amazing
My uncle's
 favorite group was 
Gang Starr
, I wish he was here
Rest in peace to Howie and
 
Guru
, 
but salute to
 
Premier
This is 
The Grimy Awards
When it's time to record
I attack the beat breaks like a viking with his sword
So throw your motherfuckin' hands up in the air
Like you don't care and make some noise for DJ Premier
[Hook]:
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
"It's Ill Bill"
"Is a world premier"
"World"
"Premier"
Say Premo!
(Premo!)
"It's Ill Bill"
"Is a world premier"
"World"
"Premier"
[Verse Two]:
I remember dreamin' about workin' with 
Extra P
 and 
Pete Rock
Put my mind to it and now they blessin' me with heat rocks
Same thing with 
Muggs
, same thing with Primo and 
The Beatnuts
My dream team injected in your bloodstream you bleed drugs
Done four with Preme
 
but this one's gots to be my favorite
Been a fan before
 
Mass Appeal
 or 
Daily Operation
Since before they dropped 
Just To Get A Rep
I've been a fan of Gang Starr ever since Words I 
Manifest
And what's my favorite 
Primo joint
 of all time?
It's either 
Kick In The Door
 or 
New York State Of Mind
Or 
Ten Crack Commandments
 or 
Take It Personal
Too many bangers
 to choose from, he's too versatile
The Future Is Now joint, Rock Stars, unforgettable
The way he flipped Above The Clouds on the hook was incredible
Society Is Brainwashed
, 
Mind Ya Business
This is a World Premier, and I designed the lyrics
This is The Grimy Awards
When it's time to record
I attack the beat breaks like a viking with his sword
So throw your motherfuckin' hands up in the air
Like you ain't care and make some noise for DJ Premier
[Hook]:
Say Premo!

Say Premo!

"It's Ill Bill"
"Is a world premier"

"Premier"
[Outro] [Premier doin' his thing on the 1's and 2's]

[Verse 1] Ill Bill
One percenters and five percenters
Album outlines the center
Rapping knives and the Berettas, the lies and vendettas
Trials of menace to society is brainwashed
Brain drops, nervous rooks cops with itchy trigger fingers spraying Glocks
And frustrated rappers sometimes swear
Waving 
Mac 11s
 you either buy my CD or die in the streets
Sometimes I feel like I was born on Doomsday
Then I think about my daughter
And the future and pray that these moods change
The road to Hell is paved with good intentions
Get on your knees, I brought a guillotine to put your heads
Essential, the essence, always carry a deadly presence
Destined to be revolutionary with every sentence
I been the one to pull the card on frauds
Put them in their place, drop the bomb and start the war
The fuck you think we brought these rocket launchers for?
Not to brag about the way we pop Techs
Ill Bill, Sadat X, who got ?
[Hook]
A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues
A lot of y’all got the whole game confused
The tricknology got me blowing a fuse
I don’t know these dudes, they can’t sport these shoes
They ain’t show you the truth, they ain’t paid no dues
[Verse 2] Sadat x
The backbone sets the overall tone
We soldiers, dude, and ain’t even standin’ straight up or weightless
Listen, I ain’t gon’ debate this
How you win the case when your shit is all over the place?
Who’s your co-signer? It must’ve been a minor
Bill is ill, ain’t no feelings heartbeat
Dudes left the Apple while we stay in the heat
Cause we love to compete, that’s what gladiators do
They say they love blood, dirty sick but
Vietnam tactics, spikes in the mics
In the States turnpikes is reduced
? after nine hours for the cake can make me stay awake
I’m not concerned with who earn
I need my stacks to blow
When I be hearing some of these records
I don’t really know these dudes, I’m not a fad thief
And I’m original pattern, one of one
After the needle line is done, the educated sniff a dollar
The rest still suck from the breast and keep nursing
Don’t be that person (never that)
[Hook]

[Uncle Howie/ "Kid Joe"]
Brand new shit from Ill Bill AND Necro exclusive come
On it's good "its whack it's smokin yea" but it doesn't dissapear
Like that it stays with ya "are you dying to try it?"
[Ill Bill]
We causin a massecre the most terrible y'all seen
Ill Bill more infamous then Chemical Ali
Continuous live coverage from the front lines dump nines
Splatter heads across the camera lens I've heard enough lies
No truth honesty's a smokin gun
While watchin the world on television I bury my dome in drugs
Yea I shot Nixon shot Reagan this is Non Phixion
Stop hittin I'm gettin paper I'm not patient
I pop pussy to pop gauges I'm outrageous
Killed crowds on rock stages I'm a hip hop favorite
The star criminal poppin off gats in gods living room
We animals stay away from Brooklyn it's a zoo
The black Benz with the 20 inch rims
Gun slingin me you lookin like the bloodiest kin
Blast you in your knee caps it's the funniest shit
Dump in your mouth kill you right in front of your kids
[Kid Joe]
You don't wanna fuck with us Psycho+Logical street villains
You don't wanna fuck with us Kid Joe's a gangsta
[Uncle Howie]
Whats this I hear?  I'm smoking crack
Whats this I hear?  I'm shooting dope
Whats this I here?  I didn't do bids?
Whats this I here?  Howie ain't real?
[Necro]
You think you're sick you'll be really sick
When I sick a pitbull on you and you get bit
You got a big mouth see I got a little posse
Of Kids that get to the point at the flip of a coin
I'll stab you and your boys where your groin and your belly join
I twist a knife I live a sadistic life
Your whole team will be sniffin codine
To stop the pain from the nose bleed like a coke feind
You get duffed even if I was hand cuffed
Every cat in my click could stand up
I'll crack you in your skull with so many bombs
You'll look like you hit a bong like you was Chong
I'm waitin for you with so much hate
You can bag it up light weight and sell it to anyone that escapes
You got a nickle plate but I manipulate
The 38 out of your head and bust your chest plate
[Kid Joe]
You don't wanna fuck with us Psycho+Logical street villains
You don't wanna fuck with us Kid Joe's a gangsta
[Uncle Howie]
Whats this I hear?  I'm smoking crack
Whats this I hear?  I'm shooting dope
Whats this I here?  I didn't do bids?
Whats this I here?  Howie ain't real?

[Ill Bill:]
Yo, a close encounter of the fourth kind
Alien abductions, suction cups, puncture and fuck
Rape, rupture and suck, clusters of pumps
Constant transfusions suction the puss
Lucid autopsies that dwarf Nazis, functions erupt
Cold war between the Devil and does God exist
No Geneva Convention politics, just tractor beams and Elohim father ships
Ever since they discovered 51, taking ten of us
For everyone of them some are never heard from again
Some return retarded, others programmed with propaganda
Honored doctors find most of their orifices tampered and soldered
Vital organs randomly removed, replaced by those of animals
In some rare cases diseases like AIDS and cancer are cured
The planet’s still doomed, modern man is a fool
They plan to hit the ship floating over Iran with a nuke
After 2012 came and passed the mothership’s arrival
2013 and publicly entered the world scene
I talked about this ten years ago on Non Phixion songs
Now strapped onto a table being operated on
By numerous species of various extraterrestrial feces
Transcended beyond existing thesis
No anaesthesia screaming, “Please kill me, read me Revelations 7:17”
The lamb of God shall be the shepherd of the throne of Elohim
Why did you piss them off? Primitive and coarse
Reverse engineering built those space shuttles lifting off
Stolen recipes, stealth weaponry  stop rivals alien fibers that resembled the mind of H. R. Giger
Like a Dr. York R & B ballad
Unexplainable like two planes colliding with three towers

Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
Religion makes God the biggest reason for war
Before money and the power
Your hour of death was blessed a little more
Rigor mortis, bullets come like a killer chorus
Humming songs to the afterlife like psycho artists
My mind roams where the street’s heart is
I give my life to my people till I end up in a stone garden
Or hanged before I take a king’s pardon
If the grounds keep it street style
Will bet my the crowd it’s started
My sick squadron raised in Hell’s cauldron
In the belly of the beast where we’re murdering a pig sergeant
Blue soldiers walk in red paths with death masks
We’ll see it all in ceremony, massacres with bloodbaths
As long as apocalypse now, surreal battles in the end of time
Done 
Francis Coppola
 style
Ain’t no other way of stopping this trial
The dark only with the lights till my last breath
I’m wiping em out
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Stolen black American Express gone, drop bombs with it
God did it, here to blow up your fucking cars with it
Life’s cheap over here, I go to sleep no problem
After revolvers blow out what’s in between your ears
Scream to your ancestors, I pray to energy in the shape of an AK47
Blam faster than handcannons Damned families curse armies, kidnap generals
Watch em drown in the concrete
Grim reaper with the street sweeper when I creep up
Around the bend, found ten million in a green truck
The war chest, more death, more murder, more meth
More money, more weapons, more gangs, more sex
Morphine, methadone, heroin, and Viacom
Anti-brainwash, I leave the ground poured with riot cops
Notorious, scandalous, keep a banging bitch
Ill Bill psycho-realm, Brooklyn to Los Angeles
[Verse 3: Q-Unique]
The ghetto bird flies over the depths of extremes in search of a fugitive
Cornered ? burst into a shooting fit
Q the urban guerilla trained in the ? projects
Heaven’s terrorist, forever your God gets bomb threats
The face of the trifle spic, the brain of a rifle click
The rain and the lightning split on the frame of a sniper’s spit
The camouflage blam from the hands of God withstanding y’all
To be in branded in the sand by the vandal squad
I’m a freedom fighter with a weakness for Brazilian waxed putas
The back of the botanica (?)
They got the block taped off with no ways to escape or break off
In a chase with the state porks have walked into a face-off
Their eyes wide, they might try it, cut the gun and get their sides fired
And if they’re gonna run they’re only gonna die tired
Q-Unique the evil Anakin eyes bloodshot red
Face your demise on the other side of my gunshot dead
> > Lyrics posted by heroin4yourears < <

This is I'll Bill, kill the police kill the president kill the police
I go from Brooklyn to Baghdad to Little Rock, pistols pop
You get fucked up like an airline stewardess bitches twat
Listen up, my brain erupt like volcanoes
Hotter than jalepanos
Half a yall rappers faggots taking it in the a-hole
I spray chrome, at your dome
Like crime out, wile out
I pull the nine out
Bust my nut in a dimes mouth
I shout loud, but y'all on time out
You get your mind drowned, head wetted up
Red with blood I smile proud
Spit the real, like the twelve tribes of Israel
Gangsta but I still don't want nobody's kid killed
I spilled enough blood, slinged enough drugs
To them children and innocent
But the rest of ya'll faggots can eat a dick
I don't like non of ya'll never did
Non Phixion forever kid
We negative I stay anti
I tried to play it cool but the plan died
Landslide avalanche casteration
Masturbation assassination of the fascist nation
Exasperation, nuclear warhead evaporation
Aggrevasion lepresy laceration
Fall to pieces, talk to Jesus
Walk though Galilee with torches creepin

[Raekwon]
Wire cell frames on me, good Nike, yeah
True, alotta chains on, this is how we do the thing, enlight me
Clubbed out, bugged out, this is what them thugs bout
Bust off shotties, knock niggas mother's out
Rolling in them renters in winter, too much bones get bent up
The saw'll eat up, your chrome for dinner
We tasting VS's, very special Cognac since G.S.'s
Now we leaning Louis sneakers and C.L.S.'s
I'm far from your average rapper, yeah Shallah, hit with an actor
Cutting through your time, then slap ya
Yo, you see me on them Smack shits, all of my Skittles on
In black whips, living comfortable in some glass cribs
Word to Jabari, my junior, only two years old
Swimming with the sharks, I'mma feed you tuna
Your pops been a whale since jail
Was taking niggas out to Brazil
[Ill Bill]
Where carnivale mamis is ill
Take me to Paul Wall, buy me a grill
I got groupies, buying me Gucci's and exclusive Nike's, it's real
I stay biz in the kitchen with the Chef Rae-Kwiz
It's easy five mill or I'mma have to take they kids
I figured out how to rape the system, I made more than your album budget
Off of a freestyle, on this mixtape, a hustler
That understand dollars and cents
I get blowjobs from runway models in France
The rap Burt Reynolds, when I married the world troubles
Producing earthquakes, turning ya stone hedge to pebbles
The life we chose, the path we lead, ain't none of us'll
See heaven, that's our own guarantee
Never, rat on your friends, always keep your mouth shut
The back of the Benz, put this in your mouth, slut
I saw, I conquered, I came and I'm out
Laid it out, all on the tonsils, then skeet in her mouth

[Verse 1]
Young mother smoke crack while her baby cries
Young brother sell crack,carry baby nines
Baby-faced gangsters wild out commit crazy crimes
Taking anything they want without shame or praig
Straight bullet hit bring momma Bed-Stuy
Led fly, final destination her death arrives
But she in the wrong place or she meant to die?
And whoever responsible they never find
Fuck flipping burgers, serving milk-shakes and fries
Kids committing murders living in these last days and times
White kids,black kids any race or price
Shooting in the high school Satan in they minds
We see everything and yet we forever blind
Society turn away you, protect your eyes
Like a horror movie but you can’t press rewind
Bare witness to beyond of it,i step aside
[Hook - 2x]
All we learned how to live and learn how to die
Building nuclear weapons and learn how to fly
I never graduated high-school I got my GED in tenth grade
And ran around Canarsie High
[Verse 2]
Young baby girl gave birth to baby girl
Thirteen brought a little baby in this crazy world
I’ve seen the same story every block,every borough
Every town same situation very through
Very sad baby girl never knew a dad
Broken home,broken soul ready to attack
Young dad doesn’t even know that he’s a father
And some dude but don’t care for kid even bother
Plenty good parents to a bad situations
Young dad went to war in the destination
Proud American that wanted to be participate
Sent home in a box or in a crippled state
We see everything and yet we forever blind
Society turn away you, protect your eyes
Like a horror movie but you can’t press rewind
Bare witness to beyond of it,i step aside
[Hook - 2x]

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, son, see the police over there
Hey Kendrick! (Hey Fred)
Would you mind, and telling them meet me by the car
Call another station and tell them to send a couple more of cars
I got Jerry, I got you...
One of them got a dick in they mouth
Hood is fucking crazy
I see about forty dollars on the floor...
I know somebody know something man
Fucking pricks be standing around and don't be acting
Like you don't know, tell us what's going on
Get the fuck outta here...
[Raekwon]
Yo, aiyo, couldn't believe what happened to Steve
They found him in the grass, butt ass naked, tied up, it's freezing
The D's knew, flew him to the south, had 'em in the barn
Arm all shredded out, vex, forget about it
His lady, Baby Blue Eye, she kept a mack in the refrigerator
Yelling how she hate me with eyes, when they bumped her
Found a Louis bag in the dumpster
New blue uzi that ripped her fronts up
She leaning, I start dreaming, damn
Niggas shot shorty in the mouth, then slid in the Lamborghini
Eight days later, they weight her, found heroin
All in the bitch arm, trick from decarter
Her girl durell nails, nigga, that's who you could say tell
Anything and everything, the nigga's in the jail, yo
For Filas, she need, need, come to, to cry
This a live bitch from the east, fronting since junior high
But let's continue to peep it, Steve, the nigga been through
Mad situations, since he crashed his Benz station
All the FBI and 'em, hide 'em
Waiting for the right time to blow a nine, right through a spine
The grind was getting serious, the coke scarce
Only niggas who live can get it, if they gun game fierce
I was in the cut lamping, yeah, watching how it went down
I'm fronting, knowing this is not my town, that's wild
[Outro: Raekwon]
Aiyo, Chef, when that Cuban 2 coming out
Yo, man.. it's coming out when I want it come out, man
Ya'll niggas just sit back and get ready for it, man
Cuz it's some real motion picture shit, knowhatimsaying?
Straight up, the date is the date
It's coming when I tell it to come
So all ya'll niggas that want to know
Yeah, we going into a very serious Chamber right now
It's the Cocaine World, I'mma do my numbers
It's all real nigga, this is not slavery
Not over here, aight? So you just walk down the block, man
And go to church or something, man, knowhatimsaying?
Cuz when I come with this flame, nigga
All lights is out, for everything, man
Trust me, I know ya'll niggas need me
Hahaha.. ya'll niggas gon' need me
When I come through, I spit in niggas hands
Youknowhatimsaying? Straight up, stepping on ya sneakers
Fucking puppets... ya'll niggas is slave workers, man
Watch what we do, you know?
If you need to get some of this, you know
You can shoot over to 225 Hudson
Or you can meet me in Africa
I just bought a crib out there, you heard?
Nice little hut, luxury hut, nigga
Muthafucking bed made of hay, nigga
Tied up with gold yarn... ya'll niggas is soft, man
For real, man, New York
I'm throwing ya'll niggas on my back
Remember what I said...

Immortal Technique's verse:
You know when the cops are comin' to get ya
Tryna' light you up quicker than Nikola Tesla
Applying choke-holds like a professional wrestler
And videotaping the protesters and hecklers
I spit on you at the Diallo march, remember me?
When New York City rose up as one entity
(Ahhh) you hiding in helicopters and tanks
And ICX towers in the streets like the West Bank
Thanks for the reality check, so far...
You been exposed as political Praetorian Guards
So you can drive drunk, kill people and only do a year
But soon dissidence to the system start to disappear
And all sorts of governments crumble, so stay humble
Violent lottery for the power ball that you fumbled
And I don't hate you all but I'm sceptical of most of you
Because the death of Posse Committals stands close to you

[Verse 1: Q-Unique]
You can’t joke with the Dark Knight
First born son with the dark life
Disperse of a hurt ya along with a sharp knife
I’m not your normal criminal mind
I force the longest form of torture in the minimal time
The hated the world learned to admire
Back to back ten paces, turn and fire
In a fight to being righteous
While you and the loser battle like the plight of Leonidas
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
We fight this, I go to war like the ancient Mongolians
Force you to kill your best friends in front of an audience
Treat my generals like family members
Fuck the world, it’s us against them
Shit upon humanity’s vengeance
Communicate like a social network
Bunch of postal suicidal co-conspirators exploding at work
But it’s a hazard of the job description
And even though we probably don’t deserve it, God will listen
But Satan also got your phone tapped
Ever since Ronald Reagan sold crack
Go back, six-fingered hand will make your soul clap
Been the word of God, demand attention like a murder squad
Eighteen-wheeler hit us on head on, should’ve swerved the car
[Verse 3: Jise]
Sticking with helium heads
Death beds with black rose pedals are fed dope meds
The feds ? coat stands
Pledge allegiance to Lucifer’s rejects
Some slept under the pale moon sky while ? got us still hot
I bled all that I can bleed, next step is death
I’m a bi-product of big brother sick swollen right eye
His brains leaking out the left wounded
Reap what we sow, that’s what they say to get by
? broken promises so I consolidate my offense
And materialize my defense
Speed-reading through violence, digest
This is a pie-eating contest
Ain’t no slice in the share and I come bearing the gifts of your options to live
Staring in the face of a society that created a beast to breathe heat
The world burns, sitting beside me while I feed on the fire that reach
Fuse you amputees like you touched the fridge
And your brigade can’t handle the consequences of not being able to clap freely
So I’m like fuck you, pay
And I’m from Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Sabac]
Yeah, darkness deepens everyday, we gonna speak upon it
The world is full of corruption, we're just holding on, yeah
It's the opening to Heaven's gate, the access to history
The recall of past lives, learn the facts and mysteries
These beliefs be our religion, systematic way of living
Rite of passage come grown blood, drawn from gashes and incisions
It's an act of terrorism in the name of a leader
Eleven dead in bunk beds all wearing the same sneakers
Brain seeking teachers sending brainwaves through speakers
In the same way them creatures claim the same pain as Jesus
They're apes to the fetus using God as excuses
And they're convincing they can heal the wounds, scars, and the bruises
They target the losers and then they promise them futures
They're making millions from the poor, their only parts to confuse us
It's alarming and foolish, they take honour in ruining all of our lives
And giving in is what we're conned into doing
In 2085, we struggle to stay alive
Only the wealthy can provide the cash and pay to survive
While the poor are left behind, going blind from the optimum contaminated air
Destroy the mind, lack of oxygen
We locked up in a massive inescapable fate
Of hatred and waste, of all the wrongs, this takes the cake
I hope it ain't late and hope we're not prisoners of God
And don't get left behind on their mission to Mars
This ain't far from the truth, it might cause you to lie
Darkness deepness in a sequence that might cause you to die
[Verse 2: Slaine]
I promised Teddy if this happened I'd be calm and steady
Eases momma's worry, put some money in this commissary
You beat 'em to dead, barehanded involuntary
They said but we know that base head was wrong already
So now I'm rollin' with his cousin Moe
Blowing coke from a dollar envelope
Heavy on the pedal and he's buggin' yo
Dime store philosophising, arguing about some shit he doesn't know
Thinking he's original
Linking with the criminals, car loaded with loaded guns
Murder plans being made, rolling up, explode and run
Blood pool's moving with the life of a human
From a lifeless body, I can feel Christ in the room
And having haunted dreams, cars peeling off
Screams, fates changed, innocent lives once upon a fiend
Ignorant eyes visualise victims in these violent times
Nowadays, every thought's equivalent to silent crimes
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
The cult leader element victims, non-retro, elephant printed
Malevolent, eloquent, excellent, elegant heretics
Of terrorism, delivered in high definition television
Listen, this is how we spit this
My words are like ballistics, my ideas defy physics
We're back to back, walking out the federal bank firing pistols
Predict the vision of a crucifixion, drippin' in blood
Before Lucifer's image lose in the list
With the news the lyrics ?
Fire, shooting out of scripture
The burning bush should have warned the Jews about Hitler
I talk to God while I look in the mirror
The cost was large, now your life becomes a nuclear winter
And I ain't scared of nobody but myself
I'm scared I might murder you and spend the rest of my life in a cell
Like the prophesies of fallen angels, the cost is major
Throw our souls on the auction table
These torture papers tell the stories of our inner-selves, symbols of pride
Lighting a fire the size of God's kingdom in the sky
We survived but we feel our greatest dreams have died
Only to find another mountain peak to climb
I gave blood, sweat, no tears, surrounded by devils
No fear, so focused, so aware, so here
So in it to win it, my tenacity is infinite
Others came and went past me but now they're finished

Tom, Jeff, Kerry, and Dave
1981 before they hooked up with Metal Blade they played
Maiden and Priest covers

Kerry King

Tom pissed on Cronos’ head, it was raw
Hell Awaits was the next anthem

Met Rick Ruben at Def Jam, strike a deal
Same year 
Rick produced
 
Raising Hell

License to Ill
He produced the greatest thrash metal record of all time
Reign In Blood still sends shivers up your spine
Their first gold album, 
South of Heaven

Aged 15 I was so mesmerized
Had

Dirty money
It’s dirty, filthy
Special Teamz, Ill Bill
Duck down, follow along
[Verse One: Jaysaun]
It all started in the Franklin mint
And the ink they used to print us had a light green tint
Bagged us up, stuck in a truck from Wells Fargo
Hell’s cargo shipped to a bank in Key Largo
Where all of my brothers with similar serial numbers
Intense scrutiny, security printed asunder
I wonder would they fold me? Fill me with drugs?
Will I be given to a priest as a donation from thugs?
Listen close, you don’t need to be a scholar to follow
To scan this trail traveled by the US dollar
If you hear me better holla instead of popping your collar
A lot of us stacked together like cheese in an enchilada
Used for change in the champagne room
Holding some ‘caine, exchanged for pussy and brain
Withdrawn around dawn by a strip club owner named Vaughan
From Coconut Grove with a manicured lawn
[Hook: Ill Bill]
The name’s Bill but you can call me dirty money
People lie, cheat, steal and murder for me
I’m God, no religion in the world’s above me
Let’s fight in the water holes, even Curtis love me
Make deals, hustle hard, you’ll be earning lovely
Whips and cribs is pimped out, the burn is comfy
Coke dealers, world leaders, yo we serve the country
Don’t sleep though eventually things turn ugly
[Verse Two: Slaine]
I got the face of a slave owner, cloned wrapped in a stack
The United States of America tats on my back
Saying God we trust, my abomination is as strong as Satan’s
The bigger the combinations of my denominations
The thicker the plot, I’ve been passed for liquor and pot
Bitches who’re tricking for a dick in the twat
Coming up, they murder for me when the pistols were shot
I built the weapons that destroy countries, my missiles are dropped
I travelled the earth for seventeen years and never been clean
My face creased to hell, bought dope for heroin fiends
I’ve been rolled and put in a nose with Hep C
In strip clubs they throw me at hoes and sex scenes
Shoved in her asshole, before I’m hanging out I got it
Yeah I’m caught up in a vicious cycle everyone’s a part of
Touched by millions of hands, blood, pussy, and drugs
From cops and lawyers to judges, addicts, hookers, and thugs
[Hook]
[Verse Three: Edo G]
Aerial thunder, my worth is in my serial number
I’m worse when they fill me with hunger
Material wonder, fresh out of the Bank of America
So I wind up in the coach bag of Erica
And I travelled in her pocketbook
Trying not to look, touched by eight hands like an octopus
New money, pre-fab, her parents put her ass in rehab
She passed me for an E tab
To a nigga who’s pretending funny
He wasn’t making, he’s just spending money
Don’t defend the dummy
Now that nigga got me wrapped in a rubber band
Put me on a chain, gold and diamonds from the motherland
I’m in the other hand of another man of a jewelry store
Never truly been poor and I’m the reason for high crime
Money can buy you a clock but it can’t buy you time

*(Verse 1)*
Let me get that needle, pass it
When it comes to the get high, baby I'm a junky bastard
The fastest, so I'm a flow exempt me
Let me get a dozen bagels and a ???
Now please arrest me, officer
Cause I started lookin' in the Nautica
Polo, Tommy Hillfiger sweater
Mr. Woody Harrilson couldn't do no better
I'm Natural Born to the motherfuckin' letter
For pleasure, I dig out your brain like treasure
Take your blood pressure, examine, measure
Discover, twenty years ago I fucked your mother
I'm a born junky, I'll never recover
*(Chorus)* 2x
Let me get that needle, pass it, when it comes to bein' the dope fiend
Kid I got's to have it
Let me get that needle, pass it, when it comes to the get high
Baby I'm a junky bastard
*(Verse 2)*
I be gettin' voodoo raw like Greek sex
I'm searchin' for six chicks wit' sloppy tits hangin' off their chests
Fuck kickin' flavor in your ear
I'd rather kick you in your fuckin' cunt, then rip off your brassiere
I'm here, Mr. I-double-L-B-I double L, puffin' on a nick a crack in my jail-cell
They pay me well for my services
When I murder kids, I orgasm
Then I get rid of the evidence
Left up on the scene of the crime
I spit back inside of my mouth when I rhyme
Bloody, little punk ass, rudy-dudy
Let me get your crack-rock and all your money
Sonny, I'm a fuckin' sicky
I'm a six-inch it in then toss you in the lake like Ricki
Illin' like a handy-capped spaz
Peep the soup-bass, rippin' out the frame of your ass
*(Chorus)* 2x
*(Verse 3)*
Walkin' through the rain, I saw you
You were holdin' hands, I'm startin' to feel like Orange Juice Jones
I don't really care if you just returned your glasses
I'm a take a butcher knife to your sorry asses
(?) Stop fantasizing about pizza-pies wit' human
Body parts n shit, get your fuckin' throat slit
Cause I'm a modern crazy guy, you're all gonna die
So why even bother actin' fly on the plane to Chicago
Call Hertz rent a rental car
Think your crazy cause you got a scar
Think again, I'll cut you again
I'm a put that doody-casserole inside of your mother's oven
*(Chorus)* 2x

Stick your panties up your ass slut bag for a few minutes
Then pull em out slowly stinking like manure shit and gag you with it
Vegas girls abducted for a price, force you to fuck a cat, saying that you don't fuck for your life force you to suck a knife
Smothered in shit like a pig on the ground

Bitch fuck your butt with no lubrication, My pooper scooper got you in the stouper give you a new asshole OPA
Fuckin bitches to death, then fuckin them once again durin the autopsy before the mortisions stiches the flesh

Stick a blade in your nipple then burn em ima slide through fuck you raw dog while you dangle from the ceiling then cum inside you
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
They say girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice but on the real some of ya'll bitches are mentally trife
Beggin for choke outs almost be on the edge of your life
I seen it all when this weirdo fan of mine lent me his wife
Double D's a hotter version of Jessica Alba
Beofre he left he told her to call me master and set up a camera
I said "Bitch I ain't down to be video taped!"
She said "Okay, Master, but please take a shit on my face!"
She had a big bag of dildos, handcuffs, whips and chains, clamps, suction toys ball gags the shit was insane
It did intrigue, up til now i thought the bondage was creeper but admit i got a hard on when she begged me master please beat me
What happened after that was a blur
Sniffed some coke, skull fucked her face till she hurled it was absurd she loved it
She forced my hands around her throat during sex'
It was amazing until i accidently chocked her to death
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Let's start the snuff cinema, now it's spiked paddles, pound your pussy 'til you're paralyzed and barb-wire bound
That's an M edge place, let 'em dress up like the gimp, chains, straps, whips and tournequets, your pain and pleasure pimp
There'll be thirty dirty dicks alternating in your slit, a big GG Allin fuckfest you'll eat a ton of shit
Bitches, double penetration, sharp knives and powerdrills
Your mouth is tastin sour when my golden shower spills
Yo, I'll cut your little clit off with a pair of clippers, hun
Left raped and blood-caked with the grimace have been cummed
Make you strip, bitch, my whip bitch, whose lashes I'm a sado-masochist, smash your tits til they look like mashed potatoes
Four fingers ain't enough when I'm penetrating muff, it's more like forty fists and there's still room for stuff
Handcuffs with no keys, slavery's my hostiest, fuck whores with no teeth, get forced to blow piece!

Sexorcist, please choke me while fucking, I love this so much
Mach mich heiß und geil, ich wills so hart von dir...

[Ill Bill]
Live at Giants Stadium with Ghostface & Van Halen
Cypress Hill & AC/DC too
Sarah Palin is a Wu-Tang fan, she was chillin with Diddy
During Motherless Child she wild out and showed us her titties
Sign of the black mark, digital triple six cash cards
Devils clashing with ansars, bitches grabbing they tampons
I have to thank God for the places he put me
Or rather for hip-hop, and the places it took me
Aim at the game, hit the scoreboard with the sawed-off, the warlord
Trying to recite what I write, could cause your jaw to fall off
Flow is unique speak to the people, my flow is the street
Words are the traffic lights and my soul is the beat
My discipline is like walking on hot coals with the feet
My confidence is like what you feel when you holding the heat
But you don't need ratchets to validate the fact that you great
But watch your mouth, I'm old school, you'll get cracked in the face
In Farragut Road, trapped in the cold
My fingers numb from bagging up coke, stranded on the planet of chrome
In the jungle where the cannibals roam
Smashing with ratchets at your dome
Creeping up amongst assassins of the soul
[Q-Unique]
I'm a Brooklyn beast bringing honor amongst crooks and thieves
Fill the bong and let's cook these trees
Hear the words of a murder fanatic, blasting with the black ratchet
I'm a burner mechanic
I'm here with Howie's nephew, together we connecting the dots
We at Giants Stadium in the executive box
In the constellation of rappers I'm the top stars
Superbad, McLovin, shooting the cop's car
And yeah we all loading the clip and feeling the heat
But nah y'all ain't killing the street like Ill and Unique
Spit venomous shit like a coiled snake king
And grab the cash in your safe behind the oil painting
Running through New York's major blocks blazing Glocks
And Decepticons lasers pop at Megan Fox
It's the Fox 5 Newsroom where my sanity dies
Cause I get more truth out of watching Family Guy
The black Yankee fitted over the black do-rag
The black banana clip thrown in the black schoolbag
My memories of Lafayette High
When I walked between the Coney Island thugs and the Mafia ties

Ayo I plan to be a billionaire, God forgive me for my evil
For doing really fucked up things to good people
I rob a rich man, try to make the world equal
To buy my moms a crib dog, I’m down to hurt people
I got ten pounds of shrooms on my kitchen table
Just sniffed an eight ball out my bitch’s navel
Satellite dish, watch the Exorcist on cable
Compare what I do to the evil that they do
I save you like Jesus and them latter-day saints, splatter their brains
Take their platinum chains and their Charlie Brown leather straight
Let me get that, Psychological Records death rap
Necrodamus make the best tracks
My music make you want to sell crack
I turn invisible and breeze through
I rob drug dealers just like DT’s do
And body DT’s same as drug dealers do
So fuck feeling you, I’d rather bust three in you
Exploding school buses, Jews, Muslims, Christians
What the fuck’s the difference? We all want money, drugs, and bitches
Let’s keep it real, even television’s a drug
If weed is a drug a Green Lantern CD is a drug
I speaks in tongues, my peeps is all thieves and thugs
Creeps with guns, Crips, Latin Kings, and Bloods
We generous with the heat but we cheap with love
Arrest me? Never that, the police is dumb
I was born to die, walk around high
This piece of shit planet got my mind designed to rhyme about the madness
Closed caskets, prostitutes and crack heads
We battle much, respect the cash gets, been a savage ever since
Read a lot of books, threw a lot of right hooks, stuck up a lot of crooks
I represent Brooklyn when I’m out the hood
Now the whole world’s captivated, gang related
See me in my video being assassinated
I’m like the seventies when everybody sniff coke
Slit throats, spit quotes, expensive like mink coats
Why I’m so fucked up only my shrink knows
Dr. Tenenbaum, a small guy with a big nose
I’ve seen it all in my short life, me and my peeps is all trife
If we ain’t sticking your moms then we fucking your wife
If it ain’t weed in my blunts then there’s dust in my pipe
If it ain’t slugs in my guns then there’s blood on my knife
I put you to sleep, now you just a cousin of life
Ill Bill motherfucker make you jump in a fight
This is for the streets, I could give a fuck what you like
Even my freestyles could fuck up any shit that you write

* parody of Redman's "How to Roll a Blunt"
AwwwwwwwwwwwwwwWWWWWWWWWWWWWW shit!
Eat it out, eat it out, no doubt, no doubt
Check it out, yo
The year 2000 begins a new age for the cop killers, knowhatI'msayin?
The saga of the Ill Bill continues
The flavor's Non Phixion y'all - get wit it
Check it out, check it out
[Verse One]
Check out this new Ill Bill gimmick that's splendid
Since you're down with other shit let's see if you're down wit this
It's about strictly tryin to kill a cop
Once you get the hang of it, after you blast one you steal his Glock
First of all you need a fat bag of dust plus the biscuit
Any local store sells the shit, friend
Purchase a milli', not that bitch Millie Jackson silly stunt
I'm talkin about the nine millimeter gun
Pick up the gat, scratch the serial numbers off
No fingerprints, surgical ones are my gloves of choice
All of these other cop killers be thinkin guns are toys
And when these cats get caught, they snitch on all they boys
I kill a cop on a solo mission; without a pair of gloves
Shot him in the face with a stolen biscuit
Then wiped my fingerprints off real careful
If you don't think you ready yet dog, just let the song prepare you
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 6X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up, what
That's how you kill a cop -- peace to Necro
That's how you kill a cop -- peace to Necro
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 4X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up
[Verse Two]
Yeahhhh!  The second paragraph, might make you laugh
When a cat try to kill a cop and catch a plunger in the ass
That's when you know you got to take the gun from him
Cause you bout to get snubbed next, and you hyped up, so FUCK runnin
And now the real fun begins son
You kill these ten cops, the best part, you walk away with ten guns
Now you the one that's takin gats from pigs
Imagine one gang, consistin of the Bloods, Crips and Latin Kings
That's when you start to realize what the police is
Government funded gang-bangin thugs; that's what beast is
They say I'm evil, I'm the most righteous
Run up in precincts with assault rifles; kill police and throw bibles
Walked out the precinct leavin no survivors
Half his decapitated wig splattered across the precinct driveway
The watts was stuffed up his body, jerk and gyrate
Shoot him ten more times, then I merc off on the highway
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 6X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up, what
That's how you kill a cop (*repeat 6X*)
Let's all kill a cop, and get locked up
[Verse Three]
Yeahhhh!  Last but not least, Ill Bill like to say peace
To all the cop killers, from the Tri-State to the Middle East
And gimme some dust when I kick the bucket
Pistol or no pistol, when high I'm the wrong to be fucked with
So everybody put they gun up in the air
Cock it back and lick a shot like you just don't care
SO - PUMP UP THE VOLUME!!  Screamin out, "Fuck cops!"
I'm out - peace to my pops, I'm off to the dust spots
Yeah, Ill Bill's in the house
Yeah, Goretex in the house
Yo, peace to my motherfuckin fam Non-Phixion
Yo, I'm out
Yo Necro, turn that shit off, man
TURN THAT FUCKIN SHIT OFF!!

[VERSE 1: ILL BILL]
I'm getting between your nerves like leprosy
Using mental telepathy, my treachery;
Stretches over centuries, I never meant to be;
Reincarnated - matter of fact if it was up to me
I'd wish that I had never been created
Them swinging swords hoards in phycho wards
Walking threw forbidden doors and then went inside of the morgue
People grimace when they witness business of the bloody instance
So keep your distance the smell of bodies is covered by incense
I show no mercy; blood splats up on my hockey jersey
Simular to physicians in rooms of emergency
So fuck the gats id rather hit you with an axe
Laugh while your skull cracks; but I'm still not happy
[Hook] X2
ALL I REALLY WANT
IS TO BE HAPPY
TO FIND A LOVE THAT'S MINE
IT WOULD BE SO SWEET
[VERSE 2: ILL BILL]
I'm turning red blood cells into dead blood cells
Using microscopic utensils within your entrails
Pushing the limits of your chromosomes
Sitting on the throne made of humans bones
Talking in my cellular phone, I walk alone
Into pandemonium utilizing plutonium
To build a bigger, better stronger weapon
I sense the presence of great evil; so I erase
And drain every bit of the power source conceivable
Bringing about the beginning of ending;
Sending the crucifieer; tending to your so called messiah
Within the fire, I eulogize planetary demise;
Felling energized as another planet dies
And nothing could ever really make me give a fuck about
Any thing you care about, so why even bother?
The blood I spill can fill the entire new york harbour
So hang the holy father and light the candelabra
[Hook] X2
ALL I REALLY WANT
IS TO BE HAPPY
TO FIND A LOVE THAT'S MINE
IT WOULD BE SO SWEET
[VERSE 3: ILL]
I'm slowly killing myself to live, I couldn't even begin
To explain the effect of the drugs on my brain;
Nothing positive can influence the trip I take
I'm driven by the negativity that instigates
Without a doubt the bloody body count increases
You fall to pieces, my mouth releases terminal diseases
And everywhere you look there's another dead fucking shnook
Hanging from a bloody meat hook; I always keep a smile on my face
So I can hide whats really going on inside of my mind
I feel nothing and therefore I am nothing
I thrive upon your suffering but theres nothing
That makes me feel happpy
[Hook] X2
ALL I REALLY WANT
IS TO BE HAPPY
TO FIND A LOVE THAT'S MINE
IT WOULD BE SO SWEET

I'm getting between your nerves like leprosy
Using mental salacity, my treachery trenches over centuries
I never meant to be reincarnated
Matter of fact if it was up to me I wish that I had never been created
The twigging swords hoards up in presto-boards walking through forbidden
Doors and then with inside of the walls
People grimace when they witness business of the bloody instance
So keep your distance, the smell of bodies is covered by incense
I show no mercy blood splats up on my hockey jersey
Similar to fusiscions in rooms of emergency
So fuck the gats I'll rather hit you with the axe
Laugh while your skull cracks but I'm still not happy
(Chorus X2)
"All I really want is to be happy
To find a love that's mine would be so sweet"
I'm turning red blood cells into dead blood cells
Using microscopic utensils within your entrails
Pushing the limit of your chromo sols
Sitting on the throne made of human bones talking of mice up in a phone
I walk alone into pandemonium diarising plutonium
To build a bigger better stronger weapon
I sense the presence of great evil
So I erase and train every bit of the pabblesource conceivable
Reading about the beginning of ending
I'm sending the crucifier tending to your soul chrome accier
Within the fire I eulogise planets term in demise
Stealing energies and sending up, the planet dies
And nothing could ever really make me give a fuck about
Anything you care about so why even bother
The blood I spill could fill the entire New York harbour
So hang the Holy Father and light the candle lava
(Chorus X2)
I'm still be killing myself to live right
Could it even be it to explain the effects of the drugs on my brain?
Nothing positive could influence the truth I take
I'm dripping by the leg and dipody I instigate
Without a doubt the bloody body count increases. It falls to pieces
My mouth releases terminal diseases
And everywhere you look there's another dead fucking schnook
Hanging from a bloody meat hook
I always keep a smile on my face
So I can hide what's really going on inside of my mind
I feel nothing and therefore I am nothing
I pry for on your suffering and there's nothing that makes you feel happy
(Chorus X2)

[Block McCloud]
Yeah
Day By Day
Uncle Howie
Brooklyn Ac
The holy trinity nigga
Check this
See Block McCloud sitting on a stoop in Brooklyn
Don't step you might slip like a fiddler on a roof
Fans respect Block cause what I'm spitting is the truth
Nasty nigga, love a groupie licking on her cooch
Cause I don't give a fuck, down a bottle of my jaw stuff
With only a night, looking for more sluts to force fuck
Ironic how the liquor make me vomit
Like denying me the things that I love will make me want it even more
Like a hard to find Brooklyn Ac track
To a fan that keep looking cause I'm cooking that crack
It's like karma, what goes around comes around
What goes up must come down, coming out the fucking underground
We surfacing from the church of sin
Uncle Howie work the single, Day By Day made the CDs you're purchasing
Niggas with bad karma, shed 'em like a serpent's skin
Murdering foes dead like blood curdling
[Chorus]
Karma's a bitch
Fuck anybody who snitch
Have the police wondering whose body is this
See the cut that make sure the payback's enormous
Have us begging for mercy from a god that scorns us
Karma's a bitch
Fuck anybody who snitch
Have the police wondering whose body is this
See the cut that make sure the payback's enormous
Have us begging for mercy from a god that ignores us
[Ill Bill]
I'll make the hallow tip explode in your brain homie
The sound of it will leave you cold and defamed wodie
When hypothermia sets in, the reaper's calling
Rising off the crucifix like it's Easter morning
Everything turn black when my heat is talking
And everybody wear black when they see your coffin
Your apocalypse perhaps is me achieving glory
Sitting on a jewel throne whores kneel before me
I'm a legend on these streets my people adore me
Storm the streets with loyalty and go to war for me
Run up in your crib an pop a sawed off on me
And jump right in front of a bullet if it's coming towards me
I'm a cross between the most morbid disease and a swarm of bees
Leaving you horrifically tortured and deceased
While you feast on goats and dance for Satan
You wake up in another life a brain cancer patient
[Chorus]
[MF Grimm]
Wild in a wheelchair like Lieutenant Dan
Feds follow me around in a blue tinted van
That's first unit, second unit, their van's tan
Black helicopters on top with a scan
Manson, even while in prison
Warned you about me, but you didn't listen
Switch picture, I run the world
Karma's a bitch and my name is Earl
Why would I, look what you done to me
I'ma kill you, you better run from me
It's a horror flick don't run in woods dummy
You's a punk but you hide it real good money
Thrown in a trunk, you riding in the hood money
Lay down and die, I really think you should money
Come out your pockets, I'm Roy Demeo
Come out your sockets, your arms and your legs go
Kickbox bitch, no love this way
Cut your head off, save it for a trophy
You mother, make her more upset
Dig casket up, dump the body on her doorstep
Shoot your carcass, bonus little death threat
That's nothing, you haven't seen our best yet
Cremate can't find where the hash is
Get the bamboo, roll up your ashes
Light it up, this high is the fastest
We get about a brick from you, you gonna last us
Everyone know I'm quick to bust a gat
Disrespect my flow, I'll murder you for that
Hide body, throw a party, picnic where you at
Side bar lawyers talk, beat the murder rap
Seeking for the max, evidence is wax
No one is safe so suckas watch your back

[Verse 1: Mr Hyde]
For the sake of the gore so we awake in the morgue
I’m fucking breaking your jaws up, all you haters get torn
Blood caked on the floor, get all your trachea clawed up
The slaughter, it shows up your bones get sawed up
Split half a clip, out the biscuit with quickness
The bitches that diss this’ll witness the sickness
Malicious, like witches concoctions or potions
I’m vicious, my hit so get dropped in the ocean
Pop with the motion, the clocks are exploding
You’re rocking the nose with the ox that I’m holding
You fold under pressure, the mould will caress you
Infect ya, I bet ya corrosion will get ya
Fester with death, your cult status drained
I’ll dispatch your batch in short spats of pain
Claimed souls that stained hold the keys to destruction
The same old brain bone bleeding it’s disgusting
[Verse 2: Q-Unique]
Still I fill you full of lead
Got the hollow tips drilling till your blood is spilling red
Holler at the villain with the ? for killing feds
I’m swallowing the pill, filling visions in my head, enemies are still and dead
Mister murder, I’ll make a jump suit out of your flesh
A powerful Rottweiler will devour the rest
You pray for world peace, I pray for world chaos
I work to alerting the beast out of a séance
Street demon will leave you in the streets bleeding
My sweet semen cover your bitches teeth gleaming
Dumb undercover trying to score bird
Let’s save the earth and smoke weed, but I’ll go to third
Losers stuck in time, find a god for a crime to earn a buck and I lose my fucking mind
Robbed him twice cause he said he had more
Let’s infiltrate the system with Freddy Madball
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
Satanic verses, black masses in Catholic churches
Casting curses, you bleed when we scratch the surface
The greed of a master and his servant, assassin and a serpent
Numbers are scratched from the surface of a ratchet
While cash is preferable to blasting
Leave you with a fucking hole in your face like what happened?
Why you had to die liek that?
Took a shit on yourself while you took your last breath
Shoulda had respect, shoulda, coulda, woulda
Hit your head with hollow tip casings
Chopper of hatred, topple the matrix
Chop at the basis, virus that get trife but sacred
Like thirty years later thinking your life was wasted
The loneliest death is suicide
A gallery of paintings covered with the blood of truth denied
Streets guaranteed to turn red when youth collide
Yeah, I even tell the truth when I lie and this is why

Intro (Big Left)
Yo What Up? It's the original Devil Dog Big Left of La Coka Nostra
(Uncle Howie)
Yo Big Left. This is Uncle Howie. Go fuck yourself, motherfucker!
Verse 1: (ILL BILL)
Ill Bill be the personification of modern day violence and hatred
A combination of science and nature designed to degrade you
And make you into something capable of surviving the Holocaust
Machinery, bitches, and weed be our power source
Blue and red rags, green money bags, black bitches with pink pussies
Colorful things, the hunger of kings, it inspires all in the kingdom
Y’all even murdered over oil wells and selling cracks in the wrong building
This is gangster music, goons and gangbangers with Uzis
Pimpin’,Penthouse pussy programmin' their coochies
Catch me in the back of the tour bus damaging groupies
Rock bitches only rap music they bang at The Fugees
I be deadly like coke and speed, heavily smoking weed
Uncle Howie screaming, “Rest in peace, ODB.”
We south paw, hit you hard with hammers
Big Left, Ill rock records, let’s bomb these faggots!
Hook X2
Ill Bill, Big Left
We supposed to be ferocious, real shit
Ill Bill, Big Left
Too much flavor I'm major, Bill
Verse 2: (Big Left)
Give me a bomb-ass chick and i"ll fuckin' dig out her organs
Big Left and Ill Bill and I ain’t talking about Baldwin
The Bronx and Canarsie, Starsky and Hutch
Quick to ride on you fucks without touching the clutch
Listen, I’ll run a train on a bitch with no intermission
My intuition tells me I need me some intervention
Fuck that shit, I’ll drink till my liver pops
Smoke a stog, drunk driving hoping I end up on Cops
An Italian Charles Bronson, slick with a death wish
Forty-four death kiss, like fuck it just let the lead spit
A bad motherfucker, white motherfucker
Quick to fight motherfuckers, take your life, motherfucker!
Live on the block where the pistols pop and the missiles drop
Corner store slinging weed out in crops
Got the lead out the box, sticking chickens like cops
Collaborate Uncle Howie, ‘05 at the top
[Chorus x 2]
[Uncle Howie talking]
Yo, Big Left. This is Uncle Howie and Ill Bill and we’re here to get high, man. Let’s do this

I landed on top of the buildin, jumped out and exploding helicopter
Draggin the pilot by his jaw
Used his body to break the fall
He died on impact, blood splattered his back was broken
Bounced wit a slight limp cause my ankle was swollen
Get your ass up and lets get ill
Get your ass up and lets get ill
Get your ass up and lets get ill
Get your ass up and lets get ill
I landed on top of the buildin, jumped out and exploding helicopter
Draggin the pilot by his jaw
I landed on top of the buildin, jumped out and exploding helicopter
Draggin the pilot by his jaw
Used his body to break the fall
He died on impact, blood splattered his back was broken
Bounced wit a slight limp cause my ankle was swollen
Cia assasin turncoat, burnin toke it serve coke
The worst, loke the fuck out we burst chrome
Double agent CIA merk both sides, and low ride
I'm so high, I can touch the sky
Fuck wit mine you get your head, bust wit 9's
Splattered like 10 pump out of our bathroom floors
Blast you whores, the dead mans the last who draws
I be the first one to let off
Gun slinger with the done figure throw ya head off
Gun slinger with the done figure throw ya head off
Gun slinger with the done figure throw ya head off
Like guillotenes I eat dog
Like the phillipeans through leg work I creep dog
Like a millipede, it's military 9 millimeter's pop off
9 millimeters that wave to your dome will drop off
A hollow tip package, slit cabbage
Get your wig handed to the coroner and examine
Life is for real, I deal wit the license to Ill Ill
It's Ill Bill, wit a rifle and the license to Ill
[Hook]
Get your ass up and lets get ill
Ill Bill wit a rifle, and the license to Ill
I seen the president get shot at point blank range
Slipped thousands of people drinks and made em act strange
Had my gat in a hollowed out book in the last page
Silliowetter and dessert eagle to splash brains
I'm in the fast lane with cats that high-jack planes
Murderous wit terrorists they know what cash means
I'm sellin candy to these billion dollor crack feinds
Dont even ask me what my path be
Run up on your family wit a gat blastin
Top of the pile, rockin like nigel withal
I turn you out like a virgin wit a cock in ya mouth
Wit a gun to ya head, they find you ina trunk of a benz
Chopped into thousands of little pieces next to one of your freinds
America pimp, my first ho was a married bitch
Now I'm pimpen the first ammendment like larry flint
A true hustla wit a license to kill
It's Ill Bill, wit a rifle and a license to ill
[Hook] - continues until end

I rip a hole in time and walk through it - I talk through it
Like a terrorist holding guns and heads of hostages
Gangster apocalypse, thug holocaust
Throwing molotovs at ground-zero
Carnovore, like Pete Steel(?) the art of war
Kill the matador, kill the man with the bull
I shatter your jaw
I battle you all
It's like the end of day show
Criminals calling cocaine snow
Doing blunts, blood splatters when they blow they nose
The rap Tom Green, I rap obscene
They try to throw my album on NASA(?)
And Lars Ulrich from Metallica
Super black market, we doped up like track markings
Run up on cop cars and blast sergeants
The rock legend
In every magazine my cock's mentioned
I leave the competition chopped headless, drowning in red piss
It's Ill Bill, murder-murder kill-kill
Run for the hills
We thugging like ?
[Outro: samples from Clerks, Carlito's way, Reservoir Dogs, Scarface etc.]
This is the Utah State Police! We know you're in there! Come on out with your hands in the air!
Come in here motherfuckers! Come on I'm waiting for you! Oh you ain't coming in? OK, I'm coming out! You ready? HERE COME THE PAIN!
Freeze!
Don't fucking move!
Fuck you
Asshole!
I'm gonna fucking blow you away right now!
Fuck that!
Hey! I'm gonna shoot you in the FACE!
Don't fuck with me!
Request backup. 1200 South Main
You think he'll kill a cop?
They're not gonna shoot a cop
Hey cop! *BANG BANG BANG*
I'm a fucking cop!
Take that motherfucker!
Shot's fired!
Officer down!
Why you stupid fuck... Look at you now!

MURDER, MURDER, MURDER
KILL, KILL, KILL
Murder, murder hehehehe, murder
MURDER, MURDER, MURDER
KILL, KILL, KILL
"At first I harass them, then I murder them" (X 2)
Last night a bitch bust my crib and found a carcass
Tried to press charges
But I walked free regardless
Like, Tony Montana
My trigger finger got stamina
You mess around and I'll BLAM BLAM in ya
Ramming your body parts down the cindering slots
I'm chopping your off then drop your pieces off a rooftop
Re-animator
Creator of the murder data
The Terminator
I murder, then I see you later
Living dead, stomping the streets of Brooklyn like a zombie
I come to eat your brain like a piece of salami
Contaminate you like a biohazard
Because I'm a sick bastard
2000 maniacs call me master
And they obey everything I say, no question
Suicide, plus more confession maintain aggression
Mr. Ill Bill brings your body to the blood feast
I'm the piece of  corps condemned great tooled priest
Bodies, on top of bodies I instigate mutilation
Under federal investigations
Kathy Pears disappeared like all the children
2000 maniacs locked in my building
[Chorus X 2]
I get hyper with a butcher knife and a hash pipe
But pack with parts all my brain cells apart
Assorted body parts I'm starting to stab and chop up
Cover the floor with plasma, then I mop up
Unless I get dressed to kill when I spill
You guts
Ill Bill the butcher ghost doesn't do manorial
Chop chop then pop, with the Glock
Go get my clip, then flip and pop pop pop pop
Goes my gat
I'm flipping psychopathic spastic  drastic
Nuclear plastic putting people to caskets
All of a sacrifice
I'm gentle  like Charles Manson
Crematoria people sleeps in a glancing
Ashes burnt, ?-----?
Undead, humanoid  end of the sent a laving
Like leukaemia, fights chemo therapy
The brain cancer, extravaganza
Directs me, infects me
Condemns me to the Brooklyn floors
Like price my pounce are stripes  two heads like spikes
Make nice, nice since I got a nadge to grind
I blind kids by poking out their eyes with my knifes
So, die, die, die, drop dead, die
You painted my face, popsicles to my brain
Bronchitis, septic virus, verbal colitis
Bottom strides
Girls get on top of guys
Beyond the graves, slash in a bloodbath
Bubble, bubble toys bring trouble
Zombies arrive, and you'll all be adopted
Strapped with gats so - step - BACK
[Chorus]
I been twisting fresh hits and grotesque torsions
I use a chainsaw, when I'm performing an abortion
I stack up bodies so back up , before I make my hatchet hack up
And use your lifeblood's to grease the track up
I grab you then I stab you in the skull with a scalpel
Make your brain madder flatter and some part of rather doubtful
Blood everywhere and your hardly even breathing
I kick you to the face and make the flat line even
There's no tomorrow I'm the hardest stir of sorrow
Beyond the gates and wait backwards like Bizarro
Bizarre, strange, got maggots in my brains
Faggots roll down the hill and burn, burn in the FLAMES
[Chorus X2]

Extra extra! Read all about it!
Extra extra! Read all about it!
Extra extra! Read all about it!
Sucker stepped up and got murdered
[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
The architect before the hour begins
I bring storm to your valley of death
Without fear with my pistol up to your head
Your life is an illusion, a mirage, and a perversion
Of God, orgies and morbid sorcery shall arise
From the Judas Priest, the altar of madness
Join us at the darkest Sabbath
Pick hollowtips, harvest Magnums
My crops is Glocks, farmer tan’s tropical
My arms are black metal with threaded barrels and chopper screws
Electric skull up in the wall of voodoo
Felt like clips based all upon call of ktulu
A real dude AKA Bill Duke, I kill crews
Big goons homie shoot up the casket, we fill tombs
Make shit move, twist truth, never will lose
Pull out the big Uz, let the clips cruise
Every word I speak causes explosions
I torture soldiers, hearts frozen
AR-15s and roses, stiffening decomposing
You got murdered
[Chorus x 2]
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Yo thirty-nine ounce pistol rosewood handle
Five heads thrown to the barrels spitting new ammo
If it’s over my money that’ll make a dude scramble
I’m dough, cheese, and bread, I’m the fucking food channel
Putting two through your flannel, man I murderlize you
My Tech ex your clan like the grand verbalizer
You piss in the wind, my pistol will circumcise you
While I’m talking more shit than people selling fertilizer
For you to be on a higher level than Crooked I
You’d have to hire a pilot to write your rhymes in the sky
Then tell the pilot to crash the plane, burn, and fry
Now even he’s like me cause I’m fly till I die
C-O-B yeah who got a problem with me?
Your eyes are skinny as the body of Whitney
To survive when I’m popping semis
I’m dropping any, God forgive me
Now Long Beach is Gotham City
[Chorus x 2]
[DJ Eclipse Scratching]

[Hook]
My uncle shoots heroin, my father used to do cocaine
My moms smoked weed with her friends the day I turned eight
Started smoking age twelve, sold it at fourteen
Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity
Conscious rap is bullshit, gangster rap is a fraud
This is real rap, bang your fucking head through the wall
This is drug music, stuck with a syringe in your arm
I'm the truth like the name of the song
Yo my uncle shoots heroin
[Ill Bill]
Bathroom floor, found a syringe
Back from the Hydro Tour, Howie went out on a binge
The snake bitch I was fucking even took him to cop
A month later he was on the floor looking for rock
Missed a flight to Czech Republic, walked in the rest
Found him lying in his own puke talking to death
Cocaine poisoning, he shot the heroin since fourteen
February 2003, he was clean
I helped him out, he kicked crack, dope, and meth
Hosted shows, free clothes, bubblebaths, autographs
Told me he wanted to make a Howie action figure
Before his latest relapse I'm glad I captured pictures
I love Howie, homie used to change my diapers
To save him I'd have jumped in front of spray from snipers
But this is just something that he's gotta do on his own
I try to get through to him with this song yo
My uncle shoots heroin
[Ill Bill]
He used to live in my crib, sleep on my couch smoking Newport 100's
Gave me comic books, bought me my first bass guitar
Learned from my grandma how to tell you the future with cards
Watch the sci-fi channel high off of methadone
More addictive than anything injected in the arm
D.T.'s five in the morning waking my moms
Got a search warrant but Howie Tenenbaum is gone
Roaming the streets, he was a superhero to me
When I was five I used to pick the seeds out of his weed
Nodding out, burning cigarette holes in his sheets
Wake up and eat a box of cereal then go back to sleep
He was a crackhead too, he might still be
A walking relapse, that motherfucker's still on the street
You tell him right he goes left
Show him right he does wrong
I hope I get through to him with this song yo
[Hook]

I be getting backrubs in backrooms of S&M clubs
I'm on drugs, during sex I use anal beads and butt plugs
I'm holding hookers dooty holes hostage
I spend my nights on 42nd street searching for chicks that into bondage
Torture tactics I practice, tear up your mattress
Kidnap an actress, than activate my raiding plastics
My zany antics keep the ladies frantic
And when I sadomise a secretary I'm very romantic
It must be all the medial substances, cigarettes and black coffee
I'm smoking crack rocklets with morpheme
I guess she would say I'm a junkie
One sprinkle of coke on my cock and I'm feeling mass funky
I'd like to be a role model
Picture me on the screen with a bloody butcher knife and a Bacardi bottle
People go think "What were they thinking?"
But then who would'a thought that O.J. Simpson would turn into Joeeeel Rifkin
Welcome to the Orgy of the Damned
Welcome to the Orgy of the Damned
Orgy of the Damned
Welcome to the Orgy of the Damned
Experience all your lusts and fantasies first hand
I'm searching for hitchhiking virgins
Yeah, you know, the type of girl that's down for like what ever's your perversion
She's got the itch but doesn't know quite how to scratch it
So I'm slipping the bitch amoeba during a surgic acid
To cause a Cumshot Bonanza
The way I'm getting all up in that ass you'd think I was a case of colon cancer
Plus I'm diseased in the mental
And when I'm feeling stressed I inject direct to my left ventricle
Pumping fluids containing pharmaceuticals to keep me kooky
Some people would describe my vibe as spooky
Or freaky, cause I be kinkier than Ludfried Kamel
The pussy vandal, sticking my fingers in for samples
(Chorus X2)
I'm doing the type of sex that pimps do
Cherry girls be hanging out my hat like I was down with Eazy-E's crew
Creeping through public transportation turnals
Looking for alcoholic sluts willing to use their mouths as urinals
I like a really touchy-feely
3 girls and some baby oil squirming on my pastropedic suite
Some and join in by a cult of love
I'll initiate you with some anastatics and a rubber glove
I get my kicks from watching chick flicks
European women shooting around out their lactating tits
Now that's what I call entertainment
Some into the Orgy of the Damned and free yourselves from the enslaaaavements
(Chorus X 2)
Soya juice

[Intro]
You been to jail before?
Me? Of course I’ve been to jail. They don’t even want me in jail no more, I’m too old now. They want guys like you
[Hook: Ill Bill]
Bloods and Crips, the Ñietas, Latin Kings, Disciples, and Vice Lords
All crews that bang
Vatos Locos, Four Corner Hustler thing, the Mexican Mafia
All crews that bang
Al-Qaeda, CIA, Hamas, the Mossad, NYPD
All crews that bang
Non Phixion, Cypress Hill, House of Pain, La Coka Nostra
All crews that bang
[Verse 1: B-Real]
From Don Corleone or to Tony Montana
Whatever you are, homie, bikers or bandanas
Riders who cock hammers and soldiers who roll deep
I’m a child of the night, homie I don’t sleep
My crew, we slow creep while you’re counting your sheep
We bang on anybody stepping up they bleed in the street
Maybe you got what it takes to lead a team of cutthroats
Maybe you hang around with a crew of fuckholes
Fakes, frauds, fictional bangers
Never held a heater til you had someone take your picture
Looking invincible with it, you did it for glory
Some did it for real and others they tell stories
But the collective we have here’s respected
Making you an offer you should never reject it
You roll with the bowl over, baby the math is simple
It’s pop pop pop in your temple
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Everlast]
IRA scheming, PLO dreaming, Celtic heathen, peckerwood demon
Kicking and screaming through the depths of hell
Bareback riding on a jezebel
The hammer’s cocked, you get shot by the shell
I burnt an angel’s wings then sang while he fell
There’s a party in hell, there’s a war in heaven
The whole world been shook since 9/11
With Muslim extremists and Zionists
Trying to rule the world with an iron fist
While the junkies and the dealers are doing the bids
Uncle Howie say it’s time for revolution, kids
Don’t spill your blood on foreign land
Come outside on the block with your gun in your hand
If you’re mad as fuck and won’t take it no more
Buck shots in the air like you ready for war
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Ill Bill]
We don’t die, we multiply
This song was not made to glorify gang culture
Nor to explore the lives of soldiers or street villains
Ghetto superstars, political heroes
Compton G’s to Brooklyn Deniros
Raised from children to killers, prisoners to peace prize winners
Was Nelson Mandela a terrorist?
Let’s consider the truth: The biggest gang in the world is the police
Our tax dollars pay for no justice and no peace
An empty crack vials crushed by ten year old feet
On their way to school past the meth heads and dope fiends
Anatomy of a true banger, I ain’t shit without my homeboys
Fuck with my set, you get your goons strangled
I won’t be convicted like Jimmy Coonan
And you're not a gangster, who the fuck you think you fooling?
My ruthless brilliance soon to produce me millions
Billy Idol homeboy, peace to Tookie Williams
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Respect is something I sought to earn damn it
I create this effortless
Take it back like Kirk Hammett when he played for Exodus
Get mines, motherfuck you and your fake pretentiousness
Spit rhymes plus I’ll punch you in your face for emphasis
Clips fly, spit shrapnel, big bangers and det mines
Militant tribal cliffhangers risking their lives
Visitors arrive, extraterrestrial villainous tribes
Exit starships dripping in a glistening slime
My dungeon master levels are high, it’s a rigorous climb
Raised on Canarsie block, stuck in this system of crime
We all goons be the first to put the fist in your eye
A loyal dude, be the one to say the pistol is mine
I used to put PCP in the spliff and get high
Let’s fly like Michael Jordan 1985
That’s the Ill Bill mind frame, mind state, I’m great
Take it back like The Future is Now on live tape
[Chorus x 2]
Yeah, this was bound to happen
I found your favourite rapper whack
So I found him and then bound and gagged him
Asked him who the best rapper is
Removed the gag, said it’s Ill Bill
And the best producer is Kaz
[Verse 2: Wordsworth]
Triumphant, worn by the sounds of trumpets
My crew abundant, surrounds the villa ground’s circumference
The crowd I run with hit you with a thousand punches
Piles and bunches, you can’t avoid it crouch and lunging
You’re found when running, bloodhounds is hunting
Hundreds and hundreds of hints that head to the house you hung in
My power’ll punish, you cowards succumb in less than an hour
And you can’t control your bowels’ functions
You all earn your own right in the booth
Solo you whack so just spend your life in a group
You shouldn’t write to the loops and make the loop
From the rope, put your head through it
On your throat and tighten the noose
My mic is a license to shoot, snipe you from the height of the roof
Precise, could hit a pigeon in flight from the coop
My motorcycle bikers in route, disrupt the neighbourhood with tattoos
Leather jackets and spikes on their boots, you didn’t know?
[Chorus x 2]
Yeah, this was bound to happen
I found your favourite rapper whack
So I found him and then bound and gagged him
Asked him who the best rapper is
Removed the gag, said it’s Wordsworth
And the best producer is Kaz
[Verse 3: Verbal Kent]
Yeah, buckle up, I’m a turbulent rapper
Rap married me, performed my own sermon in the chapel
Yeah, I’m certain that you rapping soft is the result of many factors
You lack afterthought, get your face caught on a cactus (Ouch!)
You ought to be an actress, you’re bad practice
I’ll backslap you in the face until you rap backwards
I spit classic verses, the cuts that are mine will damage you
Worse than Kanye’s mom’s plastic surgeon
You’ll get a lesson from listening, look what happened
Young rappers turn the beat off and write to my rapping for practice
You lack vision, something is sweet
You’ll dream of how I write hooks when I punch you to sleep
Stop me? Shit, I’m Rocky Balboa
I’m like a boa constrictor choking the raps out of your throat like ?
You know you’ll never figure out my hooks are grimy
That’s like trying to figure out why poison ivy is so conniving
[Chorus x 2]
Yeah, this was bound to happen
I found your favourite rapper whack
So I found him and then bound and gagged him
Asked him who the best rapper is
Removed the gag, said it’s Verbal Kent
And the best producer is Kaz

[Ill Bill]
I'm coming out from inside the walls like asbestos
A ghost disappearing and reappearing when least most expected
I yank kids on there own bloods when the monster
I'm a monster, responsible for missing camp counsellors
I'm analyzing bio-rhythms, leaving my victims with incisions
My sensory sees catastrophic visions
Over the image of Jehovah I burn sulphur
In retrospect I infect your innards just like an ulcer
Then I twist facial be just like Rocky Dennis, when I menace
It's horrendous, my bloody appetite's tremendous
Enormous, watch the metamorphosis, stickin' snitches through orifices
Remorseless on my thoughts, when I catch a corpse
I navel in the arts that are not permitted
Leaving carcasses after carcass, maggots within regardless
I'm a psychopathologist, pathologically I'd exist
Infamous, run with the twist
[Chorus: repeat 16X]
Run for your life
[Ill Bill]
Reports provided by department of forensics
Reveal nothing but innocent of murder on this premises
The only evidence being the body
No fingerprints or murder weapons located
But still they follow me
Constantly I'm under surveillance
Numerous, federal agencies provide the whole policestep interference
So now there's all types of pigs bleeding haemoglobins
Left in my tees are frozen solid from the head to the toes and
Pieces of people I take and then I reanimate
Beyond the gates I can see the bloody face of Sharon Tate
I make you submit when I dominate
Nothing you could ever do to restrain my campaign of hate
I measure my pleasure by the amount of pain
I inflict you in your torture, officer I make you suffer
So listen
I'm giving you five minutes to flee
Here's a butcher knife
Motherfucker, run for your life!
[Chorus]
[Ill Bill]
I vaccinate sockets with lip bloods, like if I was to flip once
I snag a body bag them dirty fucking cunts
Shooting chemicals directly into my jugular - look around
Shits getting uglier and uglier
Spinning' within my hyper-barrack chamber
Nothing short of a bloody rusty razor
Fingerprint that could stop my behaviour
Generally, and federally
Etcetera, etcetera, shooting Storm Troopers like dead era
I emphasize like emphysema
Every word I speak creeps up in your bloodstream like Leukaemia
I instigate mutilation
Under federal investigation escaping police stations
Taking all types of narcotics made to enhance my optics
I'm lacking consciousness when I pump acid trips
And want to kill the pigs (mumbling)
I'm lacking consciousness to let the razor rip open my wrist
[Chorus]

[Verse 1: Ill Bill]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
I see past everyone else, my name is Billy Idol and my influence is heavily felt
Do it myself, my DNA inflict your slaughter like Tony way vocal talks shit to his daughter
As I approach the hour of reprisal
In a black truck, black moon, black guns, black metal, black sun
Two minutes until midnight, we amped up
Homie, stand up, leave the competition blammed up
Walk quietly and carry a humongous biscuit
I'm that guy that smacked your moms and fucked your sister
I care less whether you love Buddha or Jesus
Not even Mohammed could stop these bullets from freezing
Your blood ice cold in your arms and legs
Lie in a lifeless pose plus you're missing part of your head
I often thought if I could travel through time, what I would do
Often I drift between breaths of ganja fumes
Seeing mayhem unfold in the yards of schools
Seeing Satan on the chrome screaming God's a fool
Peep the angel of death creepin' on you dudes
You're confusing my customers, man, you're not the truth
[Verse 2: Slaine]
We walk close to the edge and we don't care what the limit is
This is business, we the new Cohens and Simmonses
The bad seed you catch growing your images
You don't know any lyricists, you only know what a gimmick is
I know about parents' dreams, I know where gimmick is
I know about guns, drugs, I know the whole city, kid
I know what an idiot is, where he lives with his bitch and his kid
For the bitch that he did was dug
I know about hate, I know there's no love
I know about the stress from an AIDS test, I fuck with no glove
Tattoos from a dirty needle, spelling my alias
Ask about me in the bean and they'll tell you how real he is
[Verse 3: Big Left]
I'm the monsoon goon, pistol packing with coke
Packaging ropes, bringing razors to the back of your throat
Every record that I made is like a package of dope
So take a sniff of fury, homie, take a whack of the hope
[Verse 4: Everlast]
Call me Mister White, call me Whitey Furrah
Play me out, call me Devil and I'll send you to God
You pretend to be hard, yo I bring the Jihad
I make war on the man who makes war on the D [?]
On the Rahkman and Rahim, Capo regime, captain of the team
I know I'm uncivilzed, I know I'm unclean
I know I get high, I know I'm sick, I'm obscene
Subliminal inning, original sinning
Purple drinks swimming, chasing young loose women
There's flames for the coward, praise for the martyr
I'm older, I'm wiser, I'm James fucking Carter
In the meanwhile you're going out like Reagan
If your girl goes wild, sacrifice that pagan
Cause it's Coka, it's going down
Do you want it by the kee, do you want it by the pound?
Yo it's Coka, it's going down
Do you want it by the kee, do you want it by the pound?
Yo it's Coka, it's going down
Do you want it by the kee, do you want it by the pound?
Yo it's Coka, it's going down
Do you want it by the kee, do you want it by the pound?
Yo it's Coka

[sample from Dusk Till Dawn]
Rule number 1 - no noise no questions.  If you make a noise, Mr. 44 makes a noise
If you ask a question, Mr. 44 answers it.  Rule number 2 - you do what we say when we say it
If you don't, see rule number 1.  Rule number 3 - don't you ever try and fucking run on us
Cause I got 6 little friends and they can all run faster then you can
[Mr. Hyde]
Hey yo I let the automatic spit to show you I ain't havin it
I use the icepick kid to stab is always adequate
You never should've stoked the blade the tore your throat
They left you leakin liquid like a bitch who's water broke
Put a pillow on your face kid and drown out your screams
Count the widows I made kid it's around in the teens
I got an ounce of the haze a 4 pounder to blaze
Anxious to kill you like a convict countin his days
Against the 4/5th your vest got no clout
Put a hole in you 'so big intestines fall out
Public enemy 1 I'm always ready to dump
And if you askin for a bullet I got plenty to dump
I hold a sixteen shooter and it bust like a tank
I chill with psychos that can turn a toothbrush to a shank
The grimy type with a rope that still collided with smoke
Who's idea of a fair one is a knife in your throat
See we can kill you with raps or we could kill you with gats
I got an '89 Taurus painted silver and black
Started to fill you with caps just like your dentist do teeth
It's as simple as teeth we'll leave you dead in the street
[Necro]
Street veterans you better watch your fuckin step
We'll beat you to death Hyde and Ill Bill wreck
Street veterans gangsters criminals
Drug dealers that'll stab you up in different intervals
Street veterans OG's that done did it
Don't ever try to bring it you bitch you must be kiddin
Street veterans Ill Bill and Hyde rip it
Over a carcass you start it it's real shit legitimate
[Ill Bill]
I know the world's over but I'm a get mines while I'm here
Still ready with the microchip up in my ear
I seen enough people eatin gettin paper over my ideas
And I'm a murder everybody each time I hear
I came to collect blood sweat pain and respect
Diamonds connectin my name on the chain on my neck
They're probably starin I built a foundation beneath it
Got 100,000 gooned out creeps that speak it
Cause hysteria like pissed cripes with trick dice
Get your ear ripped off like an East New York pit fight
I spits like poverty my shit's dirty and grimy like robbery
I make you buy guns I help the economy
It's drugs where I come from thugs where I come from
We stab at your ribs and kidnap where I'm from son
We foul like that we reppin a war
Heated by most loved by few respected by all
[Necro]
Street veterans you better watch your fuckin step
We'll beat you to death Hyde and Ill Bill wreck
Street veterans gangsters criminals
Drug dealers that'll stab you up in different intervals
Street veterans OG's that done did it
Don't ever try to bring it you bitch you must be kiddin
Street veterans Ill Bill and Hyde rip it
Over a carcass you start it it's real shit legitimate

[Verse 1:Slaine]
I was sort of sicko I'm psycho slightly insane
Stick a nickle bag writing >?????<
Hit a fucking cab

[Verse 1: Solicit]
The Bible says the first shall be last, and the last first
Well I'm at the back of the line till I'm inline in a black hearse
It's coming fast and the facts hurt, so let this verse act as my last words
There's no going back this time, I'm playing for keeps
I can feel my number coming, I've been praying for weeks
Every nation is praising the beast, and what they say in a speech ain't gonna sway me or change my beliefs
My whole life I’ve been hearing this
I was raised as a kid to fear GOD and I cherish the experience
But no matter what I say they’re not hearing me clear and it’s funny, I’m just labeled a conspiracy theorist
I’ve been seeing it for years and it’s not right
My thoughts might be what it takes to save a lost life
But when my time comes and I’m under the spotlight, I’m gone
But I’m never looking back like Lot’s wife
[Hook: ILL BILL]
I bring the light like Yeshua, the truth like William Cooper
Master Architects amongst the reptilian shooters
Amongst the brazen serpents and talking simian troopers
Drugs and Satan worship, torturing millions of humans
Above the pain, righteous man stand above influence
And nothing’s changed, except this time we ain’t trusting Judas
Their blood will rain from a dark sky, flood the sewers
Our guns will blaze, their sorcery will never consume us
[Verse 2: Travisty One]
We’re truly on some live, love, and light versus evil shit
And Google’s watching close, we’re kind of crazy for releasing this
Even if you’re thinking we ain’t sinking into tyranny, it’s clear to me
We’re just trying to see how many ears we’ll reach
You think I’ve gone cuckoo, then look up Gulf of Tonkin
Read Behold a Pale Horse, and the Northwoods document
From what I’ve seen so far, I’m not sure we can stop them yet
But that’s not the point, you gotta wake up, there’s lots ahead
At this point, GOD and each other is all we have
It’s a matter of time before the next false flag
Which they’re gonna use to further abuse our rights
They plan to turn us commie first, then turn off our lights
They murder our Christ in schools like we like the abuse
Then euthanize the suicidal youth, or recruit them into fighting troops
Far-fetched? What do you expect from conspiracy theorists
Just pray we’re around long enough to see that you hear it
[Hook]

[Verse 1: I'll Bill]
Listen to Art Bell, Cookie Puss like Carvel
Bulletproof like Luca age 12 Marvel
Bohemian Grove speaking Elohimian code
Under the table sale of reptilian skulls
Sherm, purple pill, word to Bill, murder guild, burn your face
Burger grill meatloaf head Gucci and cokeheads
A Lopez wannabe, Scarface operated
Another Scarface incarcerated
He said dude, bro, had a jew fro, looked like Tony Kukoc
High glucose and blood sugar drug boogers
Trouble shooters, double Grey Goose
Trey deuce in the bubble goose
Hundred proof, who the fuck are you?
Came through with a Brooklyn face
Jordan started [?] to crooked taste
Blew a whole in the wall and took the safe
Got knocked, got a nose job and blew the case
Then knocked again cause after surgery he looked the same
[Hook:]
Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable
Easy to tell, fuck with me and I will see you in Hell
The unfuckwithable, the uncrushable
There ain't no stopping the unstoppable
[Verse 2: Sicknature]
They tell him break a leg so he can start off on the wrong foot
And go stomping toward the coffin coughing the wrong hook
Loosen his numerals son of [?]
While the industrial tumors grow
The whole fucking world is a Truman Show
A true to first like I'm fucking smacking your Tonka
They come with war tech, they're smarter than Hannibal Barca
Personality sniper strikes till every bastard is lifeless
The newest fancy gadgets, using tracking devices
They be sniffing your route when you chill on a couch
They planted shit in your house claiming that you dipping your snout
But the law points fingers from the villains it's out
Every third pig is using bricks when building his house
A rough world, nobody's staged and accidents happen global
From the fucking Titanic to the factories in Chernobyl
But you keep standing firm so keep turning it louder
Keep banging your head so your cranium turn into powder
He's uncrushable
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Sabac Red]
I do dirt then wash my hands with the water of Satan
Reverse the roles and merge the souls, see the god in it's making
Shaking exorcism mathematics science and pagans awaiting death
While life is lived in the lines of the pavements
Creating off seeds, we all bleed and thirst for blood
Invading [?], chasing dreams facing curse of love
It's kinda bugged when your affection doesn't match your intentions
And attention that you gain is only based on when you're mentioned
Dreading Armageddon I'm forgetting all of the rules
Possessed by pussy greedy drugs and never letting them lose
Cruise ships got surveillance when we vacate with the aliens
And share notes and Ambien the State we're preparing them
Be wary of their lies and deceitful truths
The scary minds are the wise and streets is proof
We move fast and try to last for the rest of the way
Because tomorrow should better than yesterday's today

[Verse One: Planetary]
I came across a cross on fire, threw it at the altar for hire
I be spitting so awkward I’m tired
I roll with shooters who’s up in this bitch with the Rugers
I drip mic in the fluid, I’m the illest and truest
I move with my units, I’m unified with goons
We mobbing, I’m taking your life for the price of a car at the auction
Don’t take much – yeah, times is hard, yo
Bill got the revolver poking out of the Volvo
Uh huh multiple heaters out the two-seaters
Riding 9 to 5 rallying hard for Mumia
I speak true ether, either you hate or love it
I break your face in half without breaking the budget
Fuck it – I’m as rugged as Brownsville, Badlands
Down by them Killadel, it’s all real
Ya’ll ill to them niggas on your block posted
I can’t tell, and it’s not cause I’m not focused
[Hook] {x2}
We came from the days where you had to watch what you say
Respect the older gods or they had to wash you away
Tables turned, now we the ones to bury your body
Demanding respect, don’t know? You better ask somebody
[Verse Two: Crypt the Warchild]
Everybody gotta die, suicide, homicide
Everyone got heat – Bowling For Columbine
I swear I’m out my mind, out to shine, out for mine
Kill everyone if they insist on dropping dimes
Razorblade your eyelids, sleep on me now
Chill your voice box – you speaking like a fucking child
Y’all don’t want it now, y’all don’t want it never
Y’all don’t want a war with us y’all niggas know better
We spot-rushers, whole team come crashing in
The block cover, that’s how we trap em in
Lay it all on the table, this time we cashing in
You either love it or hate it we got em panicking
Don’t make me tap your chin, black out, pass the Henn
Masked men, black tims, got your block collapsing in
You wanna come to where we at, sneak a ratchet in
I catch bodies all day – human trafficking
[Hook]
[Verse Three: Ill BIll]
Demonic prophecies, sci-fi odyssey
Motorcycle shootout drive-by’s and robberies
Sheeps and wolves, creeps and goons, sleeps for ?
Peep the sour dies and shrooms
Desert Eagle heat, Desert Storm fatigue, Heavy Metal Kings
On a private jet injecting heroin
Nawh homie let me chill, that’s my uncle’s habit
Rein in the TEC, don’t make me pop the trunk for ratchets
Ill Bill & Outerspace calculate which route to take
With every single chess move we make mountains shake
Count the cake, a hundred thou apiece
It’s a nice amount to make
I’m about to put it down payment on a house today
Never stop whether rhyme or crime, line for line
It’s always prime time to shine
The cult leader with the chrome nina, I call it Lolita
I set the Lama on fire, you better call PETA
[Hook]

[Ill Bill]
2025 alive solar powered nines
Hard times
Sometimes I'm surprised the worlds even survived
A world of weapons
A world of deception
Technological tension
I take drugs to forget
Freedom of expression
I'd rather not dwell on evil intentions
I'd rather fuck a hologram
Fuck with these evil inventions
Remember when porn was one dimensional?
Evil angels will implant images in your brain to have sex with you
The girl of your choice
Fuck an interactive menu
Pop a pill to trigger the system implanted in you
A simple operation redefining the term go fuck yourself;
In a simple conversation I see
Model religion collapse under money and machines
God is the remote control in your laptop computer screen
Computer worship
Make you lose it and shoot a person
Log in for another consumer purchase

[Intro: Everlast]
Yes sir. What? It’s fucking coka
[Verse 1: Everlast]
It’s clockwork apocalypse, mass armageddon
Moving too fast, don't ask me where I'm headin'
Shake your ass in the dice bitch, roll me a seven
Fresh like huggy, take you all the way to heaven
Sipping on absinthe, smoking on a Primo
Kid I got family like a fucking Gambino
Shoot you in the gut like I’m Junior Soprano
You talk batshit crazy but you won’t do guano
You're just another victim, picked and plucked
Your chick came back stage, my dick got sucked
My arrogance scary and aristocratic
Bitch I ain't snobby, I’m problematic
I’ll scream “bomb” in the lobby and I’ll cause a panic
It’s iceberg Whitey, I’ll sink your Titanic
Rep’s gigantic, flow is tyranic
Like Saddam Hussein high on ‘caine and Xanax
[Chorus: Big Left]
This is war, aim still and heat up the steel
This is war, capo regime, captains at the hill
This is war, chemical agents used in the fields
This is war, grind ‘em up like Hamburger Hill
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
We don’t give a fuck if we gotta step with your family
I’mma kidnap your moms and Fedex you her panties
We top dollar, we pop lamas
We not promised tomorrow so we involved in all types of horror
Never caught up in that bullshit, divide and conquer
Riding for my homies means I’ll probably die a monster
I’m a certified mobster, La Coka rock star
Fuck music, I’m talking about the block, pa
I’m talking about bullet holes the size of God’s heart
And choppers that could put Satan inside a pine box
Imagine what we'd do to you if we wanted to
Pay LAPD to pop you like Amadou
I buy anybody, everybody got a price
Everybody got a momma, everybody got a wife
Everybody got someone he likes or loves
Spike them with drugs and decorate their life with their blood
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Big Left]
I’m the motherfucking Dre killer
President Bush learned me well
Hit anybody on the outside from jail
Big Left, I handle bars like I'm stuck on rails
Yes, a breath of fresh air like you're opening sails
List, it’s not really that hard, just picture the facts
Welcome to the major leagues where mics are baseball bats
And I’m back, make believe it’s ‘88 and I’m crack
You can tell the shit’s mine by the navy blue caps
New York Yankee fitted the Bronx was the beginning
Where cats got cement shoes to limit their swimming
This is real life, fighting like pits
Duct taping the grip
A true Hollywood story that fits
Wield the steel in the field, my fate’s already sealed
I’m stuck in a game show between deal or no deal
I spit you know the name, I’m not for playing games
Get you higher in vertical than my man David Blaine
[Chorus]

[Hook:]x2
It's Ill Bill and UG
Hollow points will fill your mug, we not playing
I'm just saying we real for real
In the booth we let it spill yeah we body it
[Verse 1: UG]
Hey yo cash rules everything around me nigga
A blast move everything around me with the
HK I spit bars and get nookie
Tell your bitch to chill, she might get snookied
Anderson Silva bars, chokehold
Either tap out or you'll black out
It's that easy, flow off the heezy
Heat leave your brain all over the floor where your feet be
UG be one of the best
Plus Ill Bill, that equals fuck the rest
Fuck the world, I'm fucking your girl
I'm fucked up off of the Yak
I jump in the booth and body the track
[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Pull out the shotty and clap, I'm like a suicidal jihadi attack
Try to react, pull yourself together, keep your body intact
Stuff your own intestines back in your body then shotgun you back
Yeah I chopped you in half, bouncing with a hundred thousand in cash
Top half of your body still talking mountains of trash
Point blank range, one for you the sound of the gats
A murder machine that's constantly evolving with class
This is Ill Bill homie, hardcore like Esham
Jump out the green van with a ratchet in each hand
Fuck you talking to? Talk to the pistol
Seeing visions of demons in a sorcerer's crystal
It's official homie, listen
[Hook:]
[Verse 3: UG]
Mind like Einstein, grind like Russell
Gotti-like ties, won't cost to touch you
I'm much too nice, I destroy the booth
Paul Pierce flow homie here your boy's the truth
My rap flows like capsules with crack in it
You lack flows, you assholes are wack in it
Makes me sick, I spit bars well
Y'all DC comics my nigga I'm Marvel
My art sells, I'm ark shell, I crush niggas
You Carvel soft as shit, I flush niggas
With IDE on the track it's the classic
Anywhere anybody bet I smash it
[Verse 4: Ill Bill]
And never sleep, we insomniac
Always popping and rob a diamond or pizza guy in the lobby rap
Now puff a Phillie on the roof music
Glenwood Projects where I started my goon movement
Apartment 2C, ultramagnetic like Kool Keith
I new UG before you MCs dropped blue cheese
? legacy carved in the stone wall in granite
From playing Commodore 64 to touring the planet
Stairwell Farragut Road capture the flow
They closed South Shore High School ratchets explode
My firearms are not user-friendly
Ill Bill aka Shooter Jennings
You fuck around you'll meet a gruesome ending
[Hook]

[Intro: Raekwon]
Yo, send all the workers up to five b man, you know what time it is man
Niggas did good this week man, let's celebrate
[Raekwon]
Bottles of crew, bagging in the living room, high noon
Couple rachets, snares, the razors and earmuffs
Walking joints, chirping niggas downstairs in the lobby converting
There's something next to live wires and goons
All in the sets hundreds to thousands, thousands to ms
Then tackle up the rims store, go and buy timbs
Hit the Popeyes, cops got eyes
We breezing through with nothing but fives
Puffing herb, we gon let the sun rise
They don't know niggas is slingering, what's the lingering?
Niggas ain't fiends, $400 jeans, cooling like it's England
Rather see me role in a hole, rocking state jeans and sneakers
Square sandwhich, juices and peaches
Not right now dick, this is our valve, we get down dick
None of that clown shit, we built it from a thou
See straight watchers, my niggas sleep, all of my unique poppers
Legends from the eighties came home, we got em eating poppers
Take money, eating steaks, being rude, feeding snakes
This is what get us all the planes and the eights
This is my land like Thailand, why?
Cuz I control it and I own it, But some say it's FBI land
[Chorus 2X: Skam2]
Now just gimme that, don't make me take that
The minute I'm finished with it, I go straight back
Re up and reload, keep up my workload
Homeboy this block is mine cuz I say so (what)
[Ill Bill]
Violation of the fequent statue to cash rules
Cocaine is a hell of a drug, the fortune of intelligent thugs
We the ones that they write movies about
Beautiful pounds, got the best doobies in town
Shoot it the fuck out, wash money, wipe the blood off of Benjamin's face
Defenders of the faith, measure the weight
Forever by itself, reaping pleasure from pain
We the best in the game, hit you in the chest and the brain
Now move weight homie and expand like Scarface
Leave you hanging from the chopper like Omar Suave
Ill Bill, suicidal live ayatollah, keeps it liver than Al Qaidia soldeirs
Sign in the name of Allah Jehovah
Portable wars, the blowjobs never stop
Freak bitches won't stop, snocker till their nose pop
Nose candy enthusiast
Bitches able to swallow an entire one liter bottle, abuser shit
We super gangsta, accurately cruising for bangers
Ya'll in the womb rappers, have to leave ya, remove you with hangers
We move like a federation of terror
Put you under the dirt, cus ain't no room in the equation for error
[Chorus 2X]
