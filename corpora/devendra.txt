We once had a time
Meet me at The Castro tonight
I held a rose, you held who knows
But that’s fine
And we fell in love, we fell in love
At the John Reed choir
And right there and then
I swore to no end
Swore to never let you go
But love’s got a way of fading away
I never saw you again
I never saw you again
Waiting in line to see Suede play
And we had a time, I wish we could stay
And waiting in line to see Suede play

The electric heart shines for you
It's given up sparks, but that's nothing new
The electric heart spins its lightning web
The spider sparkle lights the way ahead
I eat the biscuits, a gift for her
I eat the fishes, they got no fur
The open road oh God's final town
I'll take a little sip from its high drip
The earth hurts sky say your name
The earth was dry until you came
A little baby begins to grow
A happy belly begins to glow
The electric sky combing in the snow
He's always high he's a gentle soul
My winter friends with Christmas legs
And cold, cold beards and frozen heads
We keep them shiny
We keep them shone
Cause though they're tiny, they're valuable
I've lost my nails, but that's nothing new
And goddamn thumbs thumbs, goddamn you
And if all else fails as all else do
There's someone else for sure will take my place
Now flung from dreams your voice reappears
And it almost sings like you're almost here
Singing an ancient chant, spreads his dusty lens
And I'm coming in, in my head
Electric heart sang for us
Shining love

Now she's leaving
Congregation
Left the abbeys
Suffocation
She's been dreaming
Relocation
From monastic
Regulations
Now she's working
At the station
As a VJ
On rotation
In the uptown
In the uptown
In the uptown
In the uptown...

Foolin' on the human population
I know my mind's on the front line
But when I'm lovin' on the human population
Thank God my heart's playin' its part
One day, one day at a time
One day, one day at a time
Love is the birth of a nation
Born from the good womb of humankind
All these stories of creation
Came from the same flame of the most high
One song, one song at a time
One song, one song at a time
Fearing oh I'm sure gettin' better
With every morn a new fear is born
But when I'm trusting trusting trusting
Knowing that we're in it together
Free to face the unknown, free to overcome
One day, one day at a time
One day, one day at a time

This the soup that I believe in
This is the smoke I'm always breathin'
This is the way I share my breakfast
This is the way I serve my sentence
I know I know
I should lay low
I should stand tall
This is the beard I'm always growing
I know they're here I see them floating
Her empress beards they float so holy
Their beards are here they gently hold me
Well who knows who knows
Yeah I may come home
Yeah I may return
This is the way I'm always leaving
This is the soft voice of the evening
This is the way I hear my father
These are the flames that drown the water
Well I knew I knew
I could stand tall
I could lay low
This is the sound that swims inside me
That circle sound is what surrounds me
This is the land that grows around me
And these are the hands that come in handy
Well we've known we've known
We've had a choice
We chose rejoice

Life is tough and love is rough
For the man who just can't seem to ever get enough
The days go by and the women come and go
So many that you decide to get rid of your front door
So you don't have to hear them all disappear
You just sit and you wait
Staring at your empty plate
And you can say I'm a lonely sailor
Rockin' gently on my dreams
Cause I have it all, but I don't want it all
It ain't like I've never ever ever ever tried
I just never been fully satisfied
Just a tie a little shoelace
And to share a sleeping bag
And I look ahead to the day
When I look back at all the fun that I've had
But still, but still, but still..
I see so many little boys I want to marry
I see plenty little kids I've yet to have
Even when the moon goes out
Even when the sea dries out
I still see so many little boys I want to marry
I see plenty little kids I've yet to have now
Even when the sea's all free
And everything's lying on me
Even when the sun ceases to shine
I won't care, I'll still have on my mind
So many little boys I want to marry yeah yeah
I see plenty little kids I've yet to have
And in the shower I get my dreaming done
I hold my breath and I wait for the day to come
Oh little Billy, little Timmy, little Jimmy, you're the one
I may not look it, but I swear my heart is young for so many..
Little boys I want to marry

Ropa, rota
Negra gota
Yegua vieja
Lluvia dulce
Me acompaña
Por la noche
Hasta la mañana
Hay un mundo más allá
Otro mundo más allá
Hay un mundo más allá
Otro mundo más allá
Hay un mundo más allá
Otro mundo más allá
Sangre trago
Ves malos
Mundo, mundo
No te oigo
Por esas partes
Go home yankee
El obrero quiere estudiar
Y el estudiante sigue pa' adelante
Aguanta que fui
No te vayas y te vas
No te vayas y te vas
No te vayas y te vas...

You believe in visions and prayers
But you don't believe in what's really there
You're a young man on a dance floor
A young man in a young man's world
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor
Get on the dance floor

Well I feel just like a child
Yeah I feel just like a child
Well I feel just like a child
Well I feel just like a child
From my womb to my tomb
I guess I'll always be a child
Well some people try and treat me like a man
Yeah some people try and treat me like a man
Well I guess they just don't understand
Well some people try and treat me like a man
They think I know shit
But that's just it
I'm a child
Well I need you to tell me what to wear
Yeah I need you to help me comb my hair
Yeah I need you to come and tie my shoes
Yeah I need you to come and keep me amused
From my cave to my grave
I guess I'll always be a child
Well I need you to help me reach the door
And I need you to walk me to the store
And I need you to please explain the war
And I need you to heal me when I'm sore
You can tell by my smile
That I'm a child
And I need you to sit me on your lap
And I need you to make me take my nap
Could you first pull out a book and
Read me some of that?
Cause I need you to make me take my nap
And I need you to recognize my friends
Cause they're there
Even though you don't see them
They got their own chair, plate, and a seat
You know I won't touch my food
Unless they eat
From the roof to the floor
I crawl around some more
I'm a child
And I need you to help me blow my nose
And I need you to help me count my toes
And I need you to help me put on my clothes
And I need you to hide it when it shows
From being my daddy's sperm
To being packed in an urn
I'm a child
And when I steal you gotta
Slap me til I cry
Don't you stop til the tears run dry
See I was born thinking under the sky
I didn't belong to a couple of old white guys
From sucking on my mama's breast
To when they lay my soul to rest
I'm a child
Well I'm a little child
Oh, I'm a little child
I guess I'll always be
A child

[Verse 1: Devendra Banhart]
Todos los dolores ya se van
Y el grafitti dice Peter Pan
Y el zoológico de arcoiris
Arcoirá, arcoirá
[Verse 2: Devendra Banhart]
En la mañana pienso en mi primo
Y todo lo español que desafino
Que dice cuando el sol sonrie
Sonreirá, sonreirá
[Verse 3: Devendra Banhart]
Con tu cara de camello
Toma un bebé tan bello
Cada casa tiene llave
O no se abre, o no se abre

When the roots of the tree
Are as cold as can be
When the wind and the sea
Are the moth and the bee
When the rays of the sun
Lick your skin
With its tongue
And the grass with its green
And the grass with its green
And the shine with its sheen
And the shine with its sheen
And the trains with their tracks
And the spines with their backs
And your sway with its slow
And the wind with its blow
And your scream with its sound
I don't play rock and roll
And the people with their lungs
And the people with their paws
If the sky were a stone
Made of lips, made of bones
Count my teeth, keep the time
[This part is added when playing live]
I keep my time, i keep my time
I keep my time, i keep my time
I keep my time, and everybody knows
And everybody knows and everybody knows
That i, i keep my boots outside my pants
I keep my boots outside my pants
Cos i love to sing and dance with my boots outside my pants
I keep my boots outside of my pants
I keep my boots outside of my pants
You know i love to sing and dance! with my boots outside of my pants!

Baby
I finally know what I'm going after
I'm learning to let in all the laughter
Holy Moley you're so funnny
You Crack me up, you crack me up
Look out for dreams that keep returning
Cause magic ain't no hand-me-down yearning
You feel it, you want it, the way I want you babe
Traveling by choo-choo train
We know where we just don't know when
Like some everlasting onion peeled by love
Never heard a better bad joke said out loud
You flip-flop and I wild out
Can you believe it
I can't believe it but it's true
You're giving eighty billion years of giggling
A whole new world to live in
But this one's real, this one's real, this one's real
Like a bow tied Kangaroo
You be one and I'll be one too
We play it goofy or we play it cool
Everything that happened
You know it don't mean a thing to us
Cause so much is gonna happen
Because
You showed me a sunset overflowing
But who cares where it's going
As long as you're next to me

I'll take you back
Cause I don't really love him
No, no, no
Give me that
Won't you gimme gimme
Give me all your loving
And I'll call you
And hope that you won't say
If he ever treats you bad
Please remember how much worse I treated you
If he doesn't try his best
Please remember that I never tried at all
And if he makes you cry a lot
Please remember that with me you never stopped
I never held on long enough to let you go
Come back baby
I never really loved him
I'll take you back
I never really loved him
If he don't give enough time
Please remember that I never gave you mine
And if he doesn't have a dime
Please forget how hard I worked to get you lots
You, you always knew
But you pushed it, baby
Yeah, you pushed it, baby
You looked away
Come back baby
I never really loved him
I'll take you back
I never really loved him
If he ever is untrue
Please remember I was too
And so much more so
If he doesn't have a clue
Please forget how much I always had a few
If he ever is unkind
At least he'll never change his mind
Not the way I always did and still will do
Als eine Flamme reißt du durch
Das essentialisierte Universum
Inzwischen trinken wir Rum
Unser Glas des Himmels Abstinenz
Eines Tages konnten
Wir meinen dass Löcher
Wieder stopfen
Wieder stopfen
Als eine Flamme reißt du durch
Das essentialisierte Universum
Inzwischen trinken wir Rum
Unser Glas des Himmels Abstinenz
Yes I've been, yes I've been, yes I've been
I've been feeling it too
Yes I've been, yes I've been, yes I've been
I've been feeling it too
I've been feeling it
I've been feeling it
I've been feeling it
Yes, I've been feeling it too

Well these days I'm spread so thin
I'm getting carried up by the wind
Every time you get high
You might see me floating by
Well so long old bean
It's been a dream being with you
I couldn't tell us apart
Oh and I know neither could you
Don't tread on me
When you float downstream
On a moonbeam
So long old bean
So long old bean
Here comes the Mapinguari singing awww
When's there gonna be an end to wondering
When all of our troubles are gonna end cause
We've had our fill of finding our empty pockets
Emptier still and there probably won't be
An end to that my friends
Now that my tralala's are dating
Little sips of the Hollywood bowl
They mute up my mind
How kind of them to mellow mellow mellow my soul
Well they're the gambling kind
As smooth as a tuba' ass on the dole
Money never beats soul
How noble
Don't forget me
When you float downstream
On a moonbeam
So long old bean
So long old bean
I'm a little firefly
Landing on you

There's a lot of love, but not the kind I need
Have you ever made soup out of pumpkin seeds?
There's a lot of skin and flesh I never should have seen
There's too many half-ways and in-betweens
There's a lot of stays I think I wish I'd done
There's a lot of leaves my true love gave to me
There's a lot of stays I think I wish I'd done
There's a lot of leaves my true love gave to me
There's a lot of birds that people like to draw
There's a lot of sees I wish I never saw
There's a lot of birds that people like to draw
There's a lot of sees I wish I never saw
