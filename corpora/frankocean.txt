[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world, and I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
I wonder if it fucked with their conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from
[Hook: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit is getting warmer on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother is a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you’re accustomed what you’re used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it’s all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up, it’s my fault
You can blame me motherfucker, for killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tuck, didn’t realize this game fucked up some lives
“Oh, how’s mine?” -- my conscience eats it up all the time
But other than that I’m fine, I got a little money in my pocket
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop I stole that truck
And I sold that dope
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I’m sorry
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry
Could have been a actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry
I sold that soap and I killed black folk, I’m sorry
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my momma all cool, I'm sorry
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry
[Outro: Nas]
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
Even more than the money, it's just your job
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person, and to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever and next thing you know you’re in too deep
Way too deep, scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
Dudes is buying choppers to shoot down people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other, nobody wins
Ya know what I mean?

Swag, swag times two
I don't cry cause I'm strong
I don't cry cause nothing lasts forever
I don't cry cause the kids are grown
I don't cry at all
I don't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh child
But when the sun sets, just right, ooh I might
Shed a tear
And when the good word hits home
I'll shed a tear
I'll shed two tears
I won't cry in the car
I won't cry in the bathroom stall
I won't cry when I'm home alone
I won't cry at all
I won't cry cause them days are gone
Ooh child, ooh baby doll
But if the sun shines too beautiful, I might
I'll shed two tears
And
 
when the good word hits home
I'll shed two more tears
Now that's four tears - you got enough?
No more tears, you've had enough
That's four tears

She singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say,
 
I'm like who knew?
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah
[Bridge]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always
[Hook]
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the pride, in it for the ride, yeah
[Verse 2]
You said one day I'll start up my car and it'll explode
Well now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel and hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot
[Bridge]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down and radio's on, always
[Hook]
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Don't you know you're my baby, don't you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah
[Verse 3]
You'll live a better life
A better life you'll know
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speak put your car in drive and
No Benz can make you friends, she don't care what car I'm driving
No Bentley can kiss me back
This song is dedicated to my '91 Ac-ur-a my 1991

[Intro]
The love glows, I know the love glows
Oh I know the love glows, I know the love glows
Yeah
[Verse 1]
If we colored our white walls pitch black
Turn all the lights off and lay back
We can make love with our bare hands
We can make light out of thin air
Or we can close our eyes and sleep well
Dreams feel realer than right now
But whatever you do don’t let go
My only nightmare is waking up alone
In a world where you’re not mine
And the room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I stare into your eyes, I see my real life
That’s why I never sleep with my back to you
[Hook]
When I lay down, facing you
I can feel my eyelids glow
 (I never sleep with my back to you)
And if the sun rises, (back to you) behind you
I don’t think I’d notice though
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you
I never sleep with my back to you, back to you, back to you
[Verse 2:]
Laying under the covers that I stole
From your side of the bed cause I got cold
You rolled over and whispered ro-robbery
So you been sleeping with a thief in your bed
Stole your heart and your pillows
Whatever you do just don’t go
Baby, the worst jail is
Waking up alone in a world where you’re not mine
In a room painted off white
Running out in the daylight, tryna get back to you
When I’m looking in you eyes, I see my real life
So I never sleep with my back to you
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Like a nightlight
Like a teddy bear
Like a toddler’s blanket
Look at us baby, two grownups acting like children
Ooooooo, yeah
[Hook 2x]

Oh, girl you blow my mind everytime that we're alone
Girl, let's do something new,
 
baby tell me where you wanna go
So much opportunity, so many possibilities
I know when we be sexing cause you'll never know where we be sexing girl
I can't wait til you get off so I can put it on you
I've been thinking about you all day
You got that kind of love 
make a nigga wanna spend it on you
She ain't like them other girls, she ain't like them other girls
We be all up on the couch, we be all up on my dresser
We be all up in my bad, lil shorty ain't scared
We just do it anywhere..
In the backseat of my car, I know she don't mind
All up in your office, putting in that overtime
We just do it anywhere..

[Verse 1]
I took a walk with the palm trees
 
as the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen,
 
talking to myself
This tattoo on my left hand is turning purple-ish blue
Daydreams of the romance, daydreams of you
My pretty woman in a ballgown, I'm Richard Gere in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse, writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge with my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done that I just might die with
[Hook]
It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much,
 
but we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, that's American law
[Verse 2]
M-R-S dot Kennedy, she signed her name in pen
In a fancy fancy cursive,
 
then turned her term papers in
A thesis on Islamic virgin brides and arranged marriage
Hijabs and polygamist husbands,
 
those poor unamerican girls
After school she ran to me,
 
jumped in my 5.0,
 
this is the
Home of the brave, land of the free, but your parents still didn't know
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer, so baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment, before this goes way to far."
[Hook]
It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much, they don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours, American divorce
[Verse 3]
Well you can have my Mustang, that's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ don't break my heart,
 
this wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay, oh if you stay
You'll probably leave later anyway, it's love made in the USA
[Outro: James Fauntleroy]
Don't let 'em front you to saying you can't move
Without 'em,
 
fuck 'em I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began dude
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch ass dude
They so vain I tell 'em this ain't you
You can get sensitive but the shit ain't true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do, that we can't do
Man I had a dream and then the shit came true
And nigga if I did it I think you can too
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do, that we can't do
Man I had a dream and then the shit came true
These niggas can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do, that you can't do

[Verse 1]
Bitches think I'm crazy but I'm normal
I just come off as a psycho maniac when I'm performing
That's an act so I won't bore you to death
Cause I adore you..
 
and it's the summer so
[Hook]
Can you meet me by the lake
At the park, 
or in your room?
[Verse 2]
You can bring your bitches, I'mma bring my niggars
You can practice liking I, I'mma practice that guitar, baby
It's summer camp Golf Wang
 
where the talking trees are
You and girls can roll if you
[Hook]
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If you meet me by the pier, bring the peer
, 
we can menage
Ooh, your girl friend Nicki gots the back I like to massage
I'll be in the city with them actresses
The Nissan is down there in the bottom of the lake
I'll make sure you have a good time, a good time
I'll make sure it’s a good time, a good time for you
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Love sick, where’s the clinic aid 
we’re young
Fun is what we’re having, fuck it,
 
pour a glass of lemonade
It’s snowcone and poptarts I got and I got you
Let me take a dip and you can take a break
That’s only if you meet me by the lake
[Outro]
Could you meet me by the lake around ten?
*Silence*
[Intro: Syd tha Kyd]
Meet me at the lake round ten (Come through)
Meet me at the lake round ten (It's cool, wanna kick it)
[Hook]
Meet me by the lake at ten
If I'm not there just call
And if you need a way there
I'll ride you on my handle bars
[Bridge: Syd tha Kyd]
Kissing under moonlight
I can bring you to our tree house
We'll be fucking on the rooftop
If you're not down, we can just make out
[Hook]

[Verse One: Hodgy Beats]
I said niggas be takin' life too serious
I swear my music take lives - uh, period
Mellowhype
, 
things are dependent-free mind-pyramids
Breaking walls down,
 
never a
 
Black Hawk Down
, oh
They put a label on me but I see they’re all clowns
That’s why I talk English and think fast
Feel my words through the ink's last letter
Which'll never turn his back, back catcher, I grab
Extra magazines I'm in, to remind me of the places I’ve been
Returning to visit again, me and my fuckin’ friends
Before I hit the stage I clench my microphone until my fist hurt
Before I eat sushi, I’d rather get to know the fish first
For all the cats behind my time, that rhyme - that shit's worth
Everything in my mental state now I’m secure, mental ways
Dental
 
plates in my jaw for spitting raw just because
I like to floss my talent
[Hook:Frank Ocean]
Think I'm-a wear the yellow tux at the Grammy's
And rock out with my cock out...
Like "who this kid think he is?"
It’s just something I've seen Prince do
It’s true...
No matter what, I'm showing up
Who gives a flying floating fuck
What people say, or think?
Cause end of the day, start of the day they all said we wouldn’t get here anyway
You blink, and Wolf Gang’s in this bitch...
[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
When I was a kid I wanted to be just like you
(When I grew up, when I, when I, grew up)
Write my own rhymes, recite 'em a couple times
Hoping one day it blew up so me and my niggas could shine
I got 3 quarters and about 10 dimes
You can split them 10’s up cause both these quarters are mine
Let’s fuckin' celebrate, Wolf Gang confederate
We made it, we made it, we made it and you hatin'
Cause we made it and we made it
And that is not an understatement
 (oh!)
I put that on the people that I stay with
Live day to day with
, 
tour bus is the slave ship
Niggas worked the grave shift, record clean up and play disc
We must be misbehaving
But the fans love it, they get the subject
Niggas claim be rappers but don’t fulfil the substance
Fuckin rubbish, I'll dust quick
Nothing to fuck with,
 
I've got my hands on my balls, like my nuts itch
[Hook]
[Outro: Frank Ocean]
I remember I first played Trick some OF shit
And he fronted on it like.. nah that shit will never work
Ha ha ha, like what?
Family
: 
these 2 wrists of mine
I had to make them gold
You gotta let me shine...
If you’re a friend of mine
Ask any friend of mine
I’ll never block your glow, won’t curb your high
We be, in a place they never been
Hellabands, for the hell of it
In Paris Paris Paris
White wings on desert sand
Flyin' over the Taliban... Probably
We be in a place they never been
Hellabands, for the hell of it
In Paris Paris Paris
White wings on desert sand
Flyin' over the Taliban... Probably

My aunt asked my moms if she won the lotto, where would she choose to live in the world. my moms said los angeles..
my aunt asked me next.. i said africa. I didn’t think about it a whole lot, it was just the first thing that came to mind.
 
I’ve never been to africa but i know it’s a big place..
 so my answer wasn’t really specific. It probably wasn’t even honest. I don’t know. 
I’m starting to think america’s fucked. I actually started thinking that a while ago. I sense a lot of young americans feel this way too, there’s good reason.
 honestly, i just live here. i’m an american, sure, but it’s not really a choice i made for myself. 
if you gave me a map i could show you worse places to be born and better. but i was born here, i live here and it’s chill here. so maybe if i hit the lotto, i’d stay in los angeles too.. pay the taxes and buy mom a house out here
Granted, i’ll probably revise this after i see the world. but what if i don’t?

[Verse 1]
Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you
[Hook]
He said "Allahu akbar",
 
I told him don't curse me
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
 
- I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees
It's a bad religion
This unrequited love
To me it's nothing but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love me
Love
[Verse 2]
Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one
[Hook]
[Outro]
It's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
I know
Only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do

[Verse 1]
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count
[Hook 1]
Ain’t slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh
[Verse 2]
I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count
[Hook 1]
[Hook 2]
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh
[Bridge]
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
[Hook 1 + 2]
I love you, I love you

Ramadan clean plates on that bronze chevy
Finna paint that gold flake on my bond girl

- 
Stop! Stop! Stooooop! Let me do it! (Fine) No you always play what you want to play. I want to play. You don't got no Jodeci or something?
- 
All you bitches want is Jodeci, what the fuck?
- 
What is a Radiohead..
 
anyway
- 
Whatever..

No-huh-ho-no
No-huh-ho-no
Nooo, no, no
Ohh, 
I got a love for my ink,
 
it's like tear stains all over my diary pages
We wrote it together, and it tells all the secrets baby
But if this got into the hands, of those who stood against us
They'd try to develop an alternate ending for the tale

Bend ya up, and bend ya back down

Bend ya in and bend ya in and bend ya back out
All the rules to this game, oh I

Beend it girl, beend it girl..
[Verse 1- Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, Soon as I enter
I put a hurting on it
If I don’t kill it she injured
For a Long time
Summer, spring and winter
Fall for anything, you clumsy ass nigga
Jumping off the boat in some 87' Locs
She’s seen them hundred spokes
And then that woman spoke
But I don’t talk back, I put my life on tracks
If that don’t work put your wife on track
Show me where the candle wax
It must be you, cuz I burn right through
Everything ya’ll do
High octane when I bring on my last name
Mr. Lamar AKA “The Cash King"
Quicker than pre-cum
 
won’t you give her a reason;
To not meet up with me like a vegan
Psssst! God-Damn I’m the fuckin man
She said fuck her man
Now she fuck with Mann
[Hook - Frank Ocean]
[Verse 2- 
Mann
]
Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream
I pray to God that we don’t close until we reach our dreams
College tuition for daughters and I ain’t even father
Now I got a rebel at the altar call me prince or king
Six digits for me like we did to offer
I used to call me Waldo,
 
and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I hide in them uckle pants, living without a purpose, man
But that just got my circumstances
And I mean it, if you want it, come and get it, boy
Death come in threes and you’re looking like triplets boys
In high school I climbed the roof so I could smoke my weed
The dealers knew that I was young and sold me bag of seeds
I’m chasing dreams, hoes chasing me
But I just gave the name and number like the maitre D
‘cause all I wanna do was roll up hash and smash the ass of a bitch who lived like Kim Kardashian
[Hook - Frank Ocean]
[Verse 3- Mann]
She is the last straw, I’ve bend her and slip slow
My pencil draws her closer,
 
she gets high and bends low
Long flight from my Cali mistress, to a district with red lights
Prostitutes and rich niggas, just a recipe for long nights
Shake well and all they do, I’m laying next to some girl who last night showed me things I never knew
Either I’m bending space out or I’m just bending space in
I put my heart on tracks
, 
but it’s four AM and that chick’s still racing
One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolute vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t come
And if tomorrow ain’t come and that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every first name is phoneme
But here, the air tastes better, weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger, nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night, it’s Disneyland for man,
 
white girls, blue kush,
 
red lights
America and Amster…damn

Everytime I close my eyes I see a different dream

Now I got a redbone at the altar call me Prince Akeem
Six digits for me to complete the offer
I used to call me Waldo, and now they call me Walter
Yeah, I'm higher than them Urkel pants
Live without a purpose, man but that just cause my circumstances

One bed, two girls, three way, four times
My shame came off with their clothes, it’s paradise of the mind
Absolut vodka mixed with absolute freedom
I meet my darker side and it’s a pleasure just to meet him
I’m thinking about puffing and writing while fucking
Yesterday’s gone and tomorrow ain’t comin'
And if tomorrow ain’t comin' and 
that’s the name that she told me
But when you hit this level, every 
 is phony
But here, the air tastes better
Weed is more potent and girls seem wetter
Days are a haze and drinks just stronger
Nocturnal nigga, these nights seem longer
I’m only here for one night,
 
it’s Disneyland for man
White girls, blue kush, red lights,
 American in 
Amster…damn

[Verse 1]
She’s the prettiest girl I’ve ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She’s thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me
[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white
[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul
[Verse 2]
Said you should get a rubix cube over your heart
But you say I’ve already figured it out
Already figured out the love
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
Cause that’s what she feel like she on when we on each other
Loving on each other, kissing on each other
[Pre-Hook]
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white
[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul
[Bridge]
Paper to pen, needle to skin
I'm in the chair
And she’s over there
Taking these pictures
And blowing me kisses
When I asked her to hold my hand
She told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
She told me that, told me that
[Hook]
You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn’t let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

Tropical vibe, coconut milk and shaved ice
My soul glow with the low cut
No jheri curl, Jerry Rice
Boogie board on the rip tide
Parasail and deep dive, won’t think twice
Your little baby bone boy killin' me
Swearing he’s grown when he got that steel
But he ain't swam with that blue whale
I ain't swam with that ho neither
Earl said that world real
Sit back and watch the water
Hope the monster don't wag his tail
And send that big wave over
 
while
I'm showin off my pirate grill
To the baddies walkin by me
Showin skin because it's nothing
My little brother servin’ molly
Cause that bill due monday
And my passport's buried
And my home town flooded
With just a little bit of water
But my shoes still muddy
And if I ever have a daughter
I wonder what I could call her?
Nine months after I fuck on the beach
I guess I call her Karma
Copped a jet ski with the booster seat
I'm kiddin but I'm ballin
Just playin’ but I'm serious
I'm witted and I’m wildin
[Hook]
This life goes on man thats one thing about it
This life goes on dawg thats one thing about it
I’m feelin’ what your sayin’, you’re trying to get around it
But life goes on, pimpin, the wise don't doubt it
Stuck in the sky, first time upside down, on the whole ride
And I wasn’t much into the type, that my bros like
So I never really had no wife and that's alright
Black women ain't got no man
That's what she said to me, yeah she did
That you can date outside your race, I mean
I ain't supposed to show my love
Judge gotta like my case I mean
Somebody please switch my plates
Ship my car to Rome
5k on the wheels, still ain’t ridin chrome
Backpack rapper skills, veteran nigga deal
So let irrelevant nigga do, what a irrelevant nigga feel
Let a regular nigga judge, because his gavel fake and he regular still
How that gravel taste? how you paid your medical bills?
Sands white on my tan feet
Colosseum in the back seat
Straw hut where the beach be
Like screen saver when your Mac sleep
Relaxing
I ain’t racing no fuckin’ rats
I'm relaxing
And if its wrong to ya
[Hook]
Well life goes on brother, thats one thing about it
Life goes on my nigga one thing about it
Im sayin’ what you’re seein’, we trying to talk around it
But life goes on, pimpin, the wise don't doubt it

If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh…
But the distance ain’t even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
How do I stay in love with your rubish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel..
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel…
I know you’re somewhere in there..
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away..
Chiseling away, away..
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, no ohh…
But the distance ain't even a room away
You’re laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And how do I stay in love with you wrapping
Shorty leftovers in garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel…
Stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall
He don’t hear a word I say at all
I’m wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk…
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear ‘em coming down the hall and
He don’t hear a word I said ohh, ohhh ohhh…
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I’m conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You’re cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
How do I stay in love with your rubish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel..
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel…

[Verse 1]
Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't goin your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?
[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again
[Hook]
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, Can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I Know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, they'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, Can't be the last time
[Verse 2]
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, When you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Girl no way to explain it, but I know we can make it
[Pre-Hook]
I know we got issues, I don't wanna loose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think its time to rewind and start all over again
[Hook]
Everybody has there arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, Can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I Know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, they'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, Can't be the last time
[Bridge]
Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk out the door, when your clothes hit the floor
You were just about to break up, and now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh woah
Girl just say yeah-
ey
-yeah
Oh oh oh oh , let's make up yeah yeah oohhh
[Hook] x2
Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
Cause It won't be the last time, Can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I Know its hard
But we can't let it go, cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, they'll be ups and down
But It won't be the last time, it's cause it can't be the last time

[Verse]
Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now were grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But lets just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Use to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's getting heavier

[Verse 1]
The markings on your surface
Your speckled face, yeah
Large crystals hang from your ears
Are they here
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chill my pride than lose my mind
Maybe I'm a fool
And maybe I should move
To Sydney, two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'm not brave
So what would you recommend I do?
I'm living in the city, yes
Forgetting there's a jungle outside
Nah
I'm living in an ideal
An idea from another man's mind (Mind)
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chill my pride than lose my mind
I'd rather go to jail
I'd rather try hell
Or I could be a fool
And settle, for a place with a nice view (nice view, nice view)
(For a place with a nice view)
[Hook]
I would do anything for you
Yes, I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I'd do anything for you....
(Anything, anything)
I'd do anything for you
I'd do anything for you
For you
For you

Verse 1:
When you’re winning what are you losing for it?
When you’re fighting what are you killing for it?
Are you killing for it?
Say you have dreams but are you living for it?
Are you growing or you’re just dying slowly
Are you dying slowly?
Chorus:
Cause the light would shine
Like a lamp upon your path
And nothing can stop it
(Clarity)
In the right time
You’d see, all that matters is right
Right here for ya
Verse 2:
When we’re losing, what are we gaining from it?
When we’re fighting, someone else suffers from it
Someone suffers from it
Say we have dreams but aren’t living for it?
So we growing or are we dying slowly
Are we dying slow?
Chorus:
Bridge/Verse3:
Why do I miss you if you’re still here?
Why do I leave if I still care?
Why do I give up on you baby?
(Why? Why…?)
Why do you leave me if you still care?
Why you in someone else’s own bed?
And girl I can’t lie…
Since you been in my bed
No girl has been here
And girl I can’t lie…
These things in my head beginning to feel a lot like regret
How was it easy for me to love you?
Yet! So so so so easy for you to move on

[Andre 3000]
Repent yourselves, your God is here
Minds don't speak, lips don't think
Eyes don't heal what the hands do see
What don't make sense will make you think
Make you think, think, think
Why must I keep my eyes all on you
When in my mind all I really want is you

[ Verse 1]:
Do you remember, That October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started..
I thought that we were
[Pre Hook]:
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesnt matter..
[Hook]:
You have me dying every night , just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love
, 
I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night..to prove my love
[Verse 2]:
All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome
 
( T-tell me that I'm wrong )
But I thought we were
[Hook]:
On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter..
[Hook]:
You have me dying every night , just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night..to prove my love
[Bridge]:
You have me dying...
Fighting...every night
Dying....
Fighting...every night
[Hook]
[Outro]:
On the same side of the battle, oh....

[Verse 1]
Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without my muse
Nothing special,
 
every book in here I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote, wish I could revise them
But there's no erasing and the best advice I got
Was keep writing, and keep living, and keep loving
[Hook]
And when the ink dries and the pages turn to dust
So will we turn to dust, so will we dust, dust
[Verse 2]
Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library?
Is that you? No I won't put you out
Cause what would this place be without your smile
Nothing special, I fell in love with you girl
You let yourself inside with no respect for privacy
You said there's too much on my mind
Then you ripped out a page and set that shit on flame
I quit writing, I kept living, I kept loving
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
You said I'd never make it well I'm here
You told me I should go and sleep off the dreams
You promised I would stop having nightmares
If I could do my best to just not believe
[Pre-Hook]
Say I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
And that tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home
[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer
[Verse 2]
Villain with a dagger was chasing me
I woke up and you were standing right there
You kissed me and said that's just a bad one babe
Then I asked you what's that in your hand
[Pre-Hook]
You told me I'm infatuated with my future
Too in love with tomorrow
You say tomorrow's a mystery that won't be solved
Tomorrow's a rolling stone that won't be home
[Hook]
Never dream that you tell me lies, lies, lies
Vicious lies looking me in my eyes, lies, lies
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, dream killer, dream killer killer
[Bridge]
I'm gonna sleep good as soon as you're gone
But I can't dream good as long as long as
[Hook]
I'm running, I'm running as fast as my mind will let me
I'm running, I'm gunning, dream killers on the hunt for me
I'm running, I'm running, won't never let 'em get me
I'm running, I'm running, (dream killer, dream killer killer) x4

A blind boy sees a green girl
She drives a green car through a dream world
She meets up with a green club
And talks of saving the earth from itself
A blind boy saw a blue man
Who rides a blue bus through a nightmare
He leaves word to a blue home
But the blue seems different since she's passed away
And the same boy with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly
[Hook]
Said he's
Watching ohhh [x3]
With eyes like sky
Eyes like I've never seen
[Verse 2]
A blind boy became a kind man
Who painted white lights on a canvas
He once said he didn't write songs
Cause making music would be selfish
And back then he saw the flags fly
Seen them fight and divide for it
He said war is for those who foresee it
But what good is border to me yeah, yeah
And the same man with sunken eyes saw me
And described yellow so perfectly
[Hook]

He said "no, but my faith could move those"
Ohhh woah

He told me I should see love
Love
Oh yeah

Darker times
They’re telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we’ve got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn’t compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don’t let him see divide
Don’t you let her see divide
Voodoo
She’s got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He’s got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She’s got the whole wide world in her hands
He’s got the whole wide world in his hands
There's somethin' about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer ballin'
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight, but I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards
[Hook: Frank Ocean]]
You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen girl
You're 24k
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24k
 (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]]
Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night, but I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no
[Hook]
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
I'mma stay right here with you
Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes, I've found my girl
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Um, you're my G-O L-D E-N G-I R-L
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Thanks for fucking with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hopin' that you don't turn my neck green

word to kreayshawn.

[Verse 1]
You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved
[Hook (2x)]
Hittin' stones in glass homes
You're smokin' stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
[Verse 2]
You're shuckin' and jivin', stealin' and robbin'
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Crooked cop, dead cop, how much dope can you push to me
Crooked cop, dead cop, no good for community
Fuckin' pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells)
[Outro]
Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
How you feeling girl?
How's the gutter doing?
Crack rock

[Verse 1:]
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all okay, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cus it's still so hard to live with it
[Pre-Hook]
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoebox under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more
[Hook]
Click-clicking my heels wishing
 
away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday--just not today
Could have been Wednesday--just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishin away the day
Wishin the day go away, day go away, today go away
[Verse 2]
It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd trynna clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space
[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]
[Bridge]
See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
'Cus ain't no getting back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day
[Hook]

Fuck. that was hard to write. dec. 27th

[Verse 1]
A good pair of dark blues
Hand washed by me and by you
We care enough to never let them drag, never let them tear
[Pre-Hook]
We kept the tags on them so we could remember
Exactly what it cost us to get here to get this pair, (aah)
To get here, to get there to get this pair of ours
[Hook]
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like , got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts , a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim
[Verse 2]
Good jeans, with good care
A lifetime of good fade and good wear
And what we have with this
Is cut from the same cloth, cut from the same cloth
[Pre-Hook]
We kept the tags on them so we could remember
Exactly what it cost us to get here to get this pair
, (aah)
To get here, to get there to get this pair of ours
[Hook]
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like , got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts , a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim
[Bridge]
Come on, put your hand in my back pocket lets walk
Out here, yeah
And let the weather, weather ours
And never mind the sun
And never mind the faded
Cause were strong and we look good in denim
[Hook]
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like denim (got a love like denim)
Got a love like , got a love like that
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
A love that lasts , a love that we can wear
Got a love like denim

[Introduction: Amy Wallace]
Yes, he made the album of 2012. (Just ask him, he'll tell you.)
 
But that was just the second biggest moment of Frank Ocean's year.
 
Here, while wearing the sport coats of the season and surrounded by his whole Odd Future crew
, 
the ascendant singer opens up to Amy Wallace about his crazy year—including the bomb he dropped on the hip-hop world.
If Frank Ocean wanted to play you a song, you'd drive across town in the pouring rain, right? That's how we've ended up at Jungle City, a sound studio in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.
 
When we walk in, Ocean leading the way, Pharrell Williams turns down the music and greets him warmly. "Here you are," the prolific rapper and producer tells him. "You've walked in at the right time."
"Sweet," Ocean replies, picking up Pharrell's diamond-studded gold chain that sits—fat as a tow rope—at the edge of the mixing board. Ocean, dressed in a gray Supreme hoodie, jeans, and black Wallabees, smiles as he dons the weighty necklace—it jibes with the new Rolex on his left wrist, the Cartier Juste Un Clou bracelet on his right. In a bit, he'll Instagram a bejeweled portrait of himself, but first he unveils three new tracks, stored on his phone, that Pharrell pronounces "crazy, with a lot of comprehensive layers just sort of living harmoniously." 
When Ocean says he worries a rap number called "Blue Whale" is "risky because I'm rhyming," Pharrell shakes his head.
"That's not risky. That thought is dead," he says. "It's like, 'You know, I rhyme, too.' "
Turning to me, Pharrell says, "I always call him James Taylor.
 
He's probably the closest thing to a writer's perfect exemplification of the unconscious.
 All the songs are like movies. All you need to do is close your eyes."
Now it's Pharrell's turn to spin a track-in-progress. They listen, bobbing their heads slightly, occasionally both bursting into song. When the room is quiet again, Ocean says the song "feels like a Rubik's Cube melodically. You want something emotionally rich on that, you know what I'm saying? But if I listen to it enough, I could map a way out." Before we exit, they agree Ocean will come back later this evening to work on it. Pharrell is attending the first show of Jay-Z's eight-night run at the brand-new Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but he says he'll come back, too. "Ain't no afterparty more important than this."
"Map a way out"—it's a phrase Ocean will use more than once during the next four hours as we talk about his life and especially his last few months. 
He's still just 25, but it feels like he packed ten years' worth of living into 2012 alone, releasing a heralded album, Channel Orange, in July and headlining Saturday Night Live's season premiere in September.
 Throughout this period he has also been handling the reverberations of something he revealed on Tumblr just before Channel Orange's debut: his memories of an intimate relationship with his first love, a man—a rare admission in the macho world of hip-hop and R&B.
It's important to Ocean to be the master of his own identity: 
Last year he changed his name from Lonny Breaux to Christopher Francis Ocean, drawing on Frank Sinatra and the original Ocean's 11 film for inspiration.
 And yet he admits that the failed relationship he mentioned on Tumblr sent him spinning out of control, rocking him even as it improved his musicality, transforming him from a man with skills to a skillful man with something he suddenly was burning to say. What was going through his mind this summer, he tells me, was something like this: "If I'm going to say this, I'm going to be better than all you pieces of shit. What you going to say now? You can't say, 'Oh, they're only listening to him because he said this.' No, they're listening to me because I'm gifted, and this project is brilliant."
[Interview:]
GQ: GQ: 
You were born in Long Beach, California, but moved to New Orleans at age 5.
 When is the first time you realized you wanted to write and perform music?
Frank Ocean: fo: I feel like I was writing as I was learning to talk. Writing was always a goto form of communication. And I knew I could sing from being in tune with the radio. 
I would listen to whatever my mom played in the car—the big divas: Whitney, Mariah, Celine, Anita Baker.
 
Then I got exposed to Prince. I think it was "The Beautiful Ones." He was screaming at the end. And this lady who was playing it was saying, "Ain't no man scream like Prince." And I was like, "That's fucking awesome."
GQ: Your dad had left when you were 6, so your mom raised you on her own.
Frank Ocean: I haven't seen him since.
 And for a while, you know, we were not middle-class. We were poor. But my mom never accepted that. She worked hard to become a residential contractor—got her master's with honors at the University of New Orleans. I used to go to every class with her. Her father was my paternal figure. 
He'd had a really troubled life with crack, heroin, and alcohol and had kids he wasn't an ideal parent to. I was his second chance, and he gave it his best shot. My grandfather was smart and had a whole lot of pride. He didn't speak a terrible amount, but you could tell there was a ton on his mind—like a quiet acceptance of how life had turned out. He was a mentor at AA and NA, and I would go with him to meetings.
GQ: When did you start recording?
Frank Ocean: I booked my first studio at like 12 or 13. Somewhere in that season of my life, singing along with the radio became me wanting to be on radio, you know. And writing Langston Hughes replica poems became me wanting to write like Stevie Wonder. 
My dad had been a singer and keyboardist. So my mom was like, "You're going to follow that bum? Maybe you should just go to law school."
GQ: You stayed in New Orleans until after Katrina, then drove cross-country with just $1,100 in your pocket. What made you move to Los Angeles?
Frank Ocean: I had been putting together these demos that I was going to properly record in a real studio in L.A. So I saved up money doing Sheetrocking, and I drove out with my girlfriend at the time. I was only supposed to be there for six weeks. I don't feel like I ever made a conscious decision to stay six years. You just kind of roll. The first four and a half years was me in the studio every day, writing songs for other people. I had jobs, too—eleven jobs. I worked at Kinko's, Fatburger, Subway—I was a sandwich 
artist
—and I was a claims processor at Allstate Insurance.
GQ: So how did you go from Fatburger to writing songs for Brandy and Justin Bieber and John Legend?
Frank Ocean: We're talking about hundreds of things that happened. One night, I went to a listening party just to pick up my backpack from a friend. Next thing I know, I'm in this studio, and everybody's putting their laptops on the pool table, playing songs through these big-ass speakers. It was crazy. And they wanted me to play, so I plugged in, and they were like, "Oh shit." There were producers there, and they said, "You should come up to the studio and write." So I did. I'd sit in those rooms for hours. But I wouldn't write any line that was as good as the lines being written in the rooms next to me. It was just like: I had to elevate. I was looking at it like an athlete then—like I just wanted to be better than everybody else. I hadn't gone through anything emotionally yet. I had never been in love. I had never been heartbroken. When that happened, that's really what changed everything. That turned me into a real artist. It made the difference between somebody hearing something of mine and being like, "Wow, this is a fresh approach," and somebody hearing something and crying, you know?
GQ: You're talking about the relationship you wrote about on your Tumblr page—the one that you likened to "being thrown from a cliff" when you were 19. How did that change your songwriting?
Frank Ocean: It became effortless. Like breathing. Because now I have something I really need to say. It was Mindfuck.net. It was a floodgate. It opened up the works.
GQ: Def Jam reportedly signed you as a recording artist in 2009 but didn't open up its checkbook at that point to help you record. The next year, you met Tyler, the Creator, and the other members of Odd Future. How important was that?
Frank Ocean: I was at a real dark time in my life when I met them. I was looking for just a reprieve. At 20 or 21, I had, I think, a couple hundred thousand dollars [from producing and songwriting], a nice car, a Beverly Hills apartment—and I was miserable. Because of the relationship in part and the heartbreak in part, and also just miserable because of like just carting that around.
 And here was this group of like-minded individuals whose irreverence made me revere. The do-it-yourself mentality of OF really rubbed off on me.
GQ: They inspired you to record your first album, Nostalgia, Ultra, on your own dime and release it for free, right? Def Jam had signed Lonny Breaux, then this Frank Ocean guy puts out an Internet sensation that makes a lot of best-albums lists. When they tried to sign you again, was it satisfying to say, "Oh, you already have"?
Frank Ocean: Yeah, I just told them, "Give me $1 million if you want the next album."
[Re-Introduction:]
It's still sprinkling a bit when we dive back into the hired Lexus and head across the East River to the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens. I've suggested it because I know Ocean's love of movies is so engulfing that they've become a part of his vocabulary. 
On his first album, he sampled some of the dialogue in Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut,
 and he tells me he got the inspiration for his hit song "Super Rich Kids" from Steven Soderbergh's Traffic. He has said that he sees writing a song as making a photograph out of materials that aren't visible.
So it's no surprise when Ocean whips out his phone and starts taking pictures—of the Men in Black 3 monster exhibit, of the weird installation with beanbag chairs, even of the angular stairways. But the highlight is when we come upon a collection of vintage arcade games. Anyone who saw Ocean's performance on SNL has an inkling of his love of games. (He finished his set that night by retreating to play Galaga as John Mayer riffed on guitar.) Now, as he spots the original Pong, Super Breakout, Asteroids, Galaxian, Donkey Kong, and Frogger games, all in a row, he steps more quickly, as if greeting old friends.
This, I realize, is a sort of Frank Ocean version of heaven. Because these aren't just decommissioned museum pieces. You can buy tokens and actually play. I buy four, and he chooses Battle Zone, in which you try to sink things that appear on the horizon. His first game he scores 7,000 points, and the machine prompts him to type his initials in the winner's circle: CFO, in seventh place. His fourth game, he racks up 12,000 points—second place. But when I congratulate him, he points to the number one score: it's 12,000, too. "I'm the same as first place," says the man who must be better than all those other pieces of shit. And then we get back in the car.
[Interview:]
GQ: Is it true that you wrote the songs for Channel Orange in three weeks?
Frank Ocean: Yeah, then I worked on them for nine months—a typical gestation period.
GQ: You're something of a perfectionist, I gather.
Frank Ocean: John Mayer and I were talking in rehearsal before SNL, and he was like, "You love to take the hardest way. You don't always have to." But I don't know about that.
 It's like Billy Joel says in that song "Vienna." When the truth is told / That you can get what you want or you can just get old. We all know we have a finite period of time. I just feel if I'm going to be alive, I want to be challenged—to be as immortal as possible. The path to that isn't an easy way, but it's a rewarding way.
I never think about myself as an artist working in this time. I think about it in macro. I feel like Elton John just made "Tiny Dancer." He just made that shit like last night. Jimi Hendrix just burned his fucking guitar onstage. Right? Freddie Mercury just had the half mike stand in his hand in the fucking stadium. Prince was just on the mountain in "Under the Cherry Moon." And I was there. That's how I look at it. Like this shit just went down. You see the mastery that I'm surrounded by? How on earth am I going to take the easiest way? A friend of mine jokes that I have a painstaking royalty complex. Like maybe I was a duke in a past life. But all you have is 100 percent. Period.
GQ: Let's talk about your open letter on Tumblr. Posting that must've felt like the hardest way.
Frank Ocean: Yes, absolutely.
GQ: So why did you do it? Were some people raising questions about the male pronouns in a few of the songs?
Frank Ocean: I had Skyped into a listening session that Def Jam was hosting for Channel Orange, and one of the journalists, very harmlessly—quotation gestures in the air, "very harmlessly"—wrote a piece and mentioned that. I was just like, "Fuck it. Talk about it, don't talk about it—talk about this." No more mystery. Through with that.
GQ: You'd written the letter back in December, for inclusion in the liner notes. Were you afraid of the aftermath when you finally posted it in July?
Frank Ocean: The night I posted it, I cried like a fucking baby. It was like all the frequency just clicked to a change in my head. All the receptors were now receiving a different signal, and I was happy. I hadn't been happy in so long. I've been sad again since, but it's a totally different take on sad. There's just some magic in truth and honesty and openness.
GQ: Exactly how did your perspective change?
Frank Ocean: Whatever I said in that letter, before I posted it, seemed so huge. But when you come out the other side, now your brain—instead of receiving fear—sees "Oh, shit happened and nothing happened." Brain says, "Self, I'm fine." I look around, and I'm touching my fucking limbs, and I'm good. Before anybody called me and said congratulations or anything nice, it had already changed. It wasn't from outside. It was completely in here, in my head.
GQ: Did you worry it would derail your career?
Frank Ocean: I had those fears. In black music, we've got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance in regard to that issue. It reflects something just ingrained, you know. When I was growing up, there was nobody in my family—not even my mother—who I could look to and be like, "I know you've never said anything homophobic." So, you know, you worry about people in the business who you've heard talk that way. Some of my heroes coming up talk recklessly like that. It's tempting to give those views and words—that ignorance—more attention than they deserve. Very tempting.
Some people said, "He's saying he fell in love with a guy for hype." As if that's the best hype you can get in hip-hop or black music. So I knew that if I was going to say what I said, it had to be in concert with one of the most brilliant pieces of art that has come out in my generation. And that's what I did. Why can I say that? Why I don't have to affect all this humility and shit is because I worked my ass off. I worked my face off. And the part that you love the most is the easiest part for me. So I'll do it again.
GQ: I'm sure if you'd wanted an excuse not to reveal the relationship, you could have found ten people in the industry who would have said, "Wait."
Frank Ocean: The pitch is, "You'll encounter less resistance in life if you say, 'No, I'm going to just keep dating girls.' " But then you're minimizing the resistance that you're feeling from yourself on the inside. There's so much upkeep on that shit. So much upkeep on a lie. But at least everybody else is cool with how you carry on with your life. That's what they say. But know what fear does to your strength. You don't even feel smart or capable. You just feel broken—and not just your heart. Just a broken person.
GQ: So do you consider yourself bisexual?
Frank Ocean: You can move to the next question. I'll respectfully say that life is dynamic and comes along with dynamic experiences, 
and the same sentiment that I have towards genres of music, I have towards a lot of labels and boxes and shit.
 
I'm in this business to be creative—I'll even diminish it and say to be a content provider.
 
One of the pieces of content that I'm for fuck sure not giving is porn videos. I'm not a centerfold. I'm not trying to sell you sex.[Cassettes changing]

[Verse 1]
It's 2 am

BASEDGOD WAS RIGHT.
 
we’re all a bunch of golden million dollar babies.
 
my hope is that the babies born these days will inherit less of the bullshit than we did.
 
anyhow
, 
what i’m about to post is for anyone who cares to read.
 
it was intended to fill the thank you’s section in my album credits,
 
but with all the rumors going round
.. 
I figured it’d be good to clarify
…
Whoever you are. Wherever you are…
 
I’m starting to think we’re a lot alike. Human beings spinning on blackness.
 
All wanting to be seen, touched, heard, paid attention to.
 
My loved ones are everything to me here.
 In the last year or 3 
I’ve screamed at my creator, screamed at clouds in the sky, for some explanation.
 
Mercy maybe
. 
For peace of mind to rain like manna somehow.
 
4 summers ago
, I met somebody. I was 19 years old. 
He was too.
 We spent that summer, and the summer after, together. Everyday almost. And on the days we were together, 
time would glide.
 Most of the day I’d see him, and his smile. 
I’d hear his conversation and his silence…
until it was time to sleep. 
Sleep I would often share with him.
 
By the time I realized I was in love, it was malignant. It was hopeless. There was no escaping, no negotiating with the feeling. No choice. It was my first love,
 
it changed my life. Back then, my mind would wander to the women I had been with, the ones I cared for and thought I was in love with.
 
I reminisced about the sentimental songs I enjoyed when I was a teenager
.. 
The ones I played when I experienced a girlfriend for the first time.
 
I realised they were written in a language I did not yet speak.
 
I realised too much, too quickly.
 
Imagine being thrown from a plane. I wasn’t in a plane though.
 I was in a 
Nissan Maxima
, 
the same car I packed up with bags and drove to Los Angeles in
. 
I sat there and told my friend how I felt. I wept as the words left my mouth.
 
I grieved for them, knowing I could never take them back for myself.
 
He patted my back. He said kind things.
 
He did his best, but he wouldn’t admit the same. He had to go back inside soon,
 
it was late and his girlfriend was waiting for him upstairs. He wouldn’t tell the truth about his feelings for me for another 3 years.
 
I felt like I’d only imagined reciprocity for years.
 
Now imagine being thrown from a cliff. No, I wasn’t on a cliff.
 
I was still in my car telling myself it was gonna be fine and to take deep breaths.
 I took the breaths and carried on. 
I kept up a peculiar friendship with him because I couldn’t imagine keeping up my life without him.
 
I struggled to master myself and my emotions. I wasn’t always successful
The dance went on..
 I kept the rhythm for several summers after. 
It’s winter now.
 I’m typing this on a plane back to Los Angeles from New Orleans. 
I flew home for another marred Christmas
. 
I have a windowseat.
 It’s December 27, 2011. 
By now I’ve written two albums. This being the second.
 
I wrote to keep myself busy and sane.
 
I wanted to create worlds that were rosier than mine.
 
I tried to channel overwhelming emotions.
 
I’m surprised at how far all of it has taken me.
 
Before writing this I’d told some people my story.
 
I’m sure these people kept me alive, kept me safe. Sincerely, these are the folks I wanna thank from the floor of my heart. Everyone of you knows who you are.. Great humans,
 
probably angels.
 
I don’t know what happens now, and that’s alrite.
 
I don’t have any secrets I need kept anymore.
 
There’s probably some small shit still, but you know what I mean.
 
I was never alone, as much as it felt like it. As much as I still do sometimes. I never was.
 
I don’t think I ever could be.
 Thanks. 
To my first love, I’m grateful for you. Grateful that even though it wasn’t what I hoped for and even though it was never enough, it was.
 
Some things never are.. and we were. I won’t forget you. I won’t forget the summer. I’ll remember who I was when I met you.
 
I’ll remember who you were and how we’ve both changed and stayed the same.
 
I’ve never had more respect for life and living than I have right now.
 
Maybe it takes a near death experience to feel alive.
 Thanks. 
To my mother.
 
You raised me strong. I know I’m only brave because you were first. So thank you.
 All of you. For everything good. 
I feel like a free man.
 
If I listen closely.. I can hear the sky falling too

(Verse 1)
Yeah
I'm hitch hiking love
Could you take me to the hills
I'm not heavy no, I promise
I heard you could fly, could you try
..
(Pre-chorus)
We can drive for miles till no one can see but just you and me
 (ah)
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down
(Chorus)
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd See your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows ya fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows ya fly
(Verse 2)
Oh I really ought to ask
If I need a parachute or something
Cause if you take me way up there
I'll be scared to death of falling
(Pre-chorus)
We can drive for miles till no one can see but just you and me (ah)
I'm spending too much time on the ground baby please show me how
How you do it, and don't ever let me down
(Chorus)
Don't try to hide it
Cause I'd See your wings if that dress was backless
Don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows ya fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows ya fly
(Bridge)
Gravity's blowing up my phone don't wanna answer
Them sidewalks calling to me (yeah)
Gravity's calling my phone I can't answer
Ain't no service, way up here girl
We're 25,000 feet in the air baby
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling
Falling in love, but going up
(Chorus)
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it
It ain't a secret
Every body knows ya fly, fly, fly
I know you go up, you go up
I wanna go up, take me up
I wanna go up, take me up
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows ya fly
(Fade Out)
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
Show me how you do it, how you show me up

[Hook]
My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump you run my mind, boy
Running on my mind boy
Forrest Gump
[Verse 1]
I know you Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous Forrest
Forrest Gump

[Verse 2]
I saw your game, Forrest

But you kept running past the end zone
Oh where'd you go Forrest
Forrest Gump
[Hook]

Forrest green

I'm remembering you
If this is love
I know it's true
I won't forget you
It's for you Forrest
It's for you Forrest
If this is love
I know it's true
I won't
For-get-you


 
People should pay attention to that in the letter: I didn't need to label it for it to have impact. Because people realize everything that I say is so relatable, because when you're talking about romantic love, both sides in all scenarios feel the same shit.
 
As a writer, as a creator, I'm giving you my experiences. But just take what I give you. You ain't got to pry beyond that. I'm giving you what I feel like you can feel.
 
The other shit, you can't feel. You can't feel a box. You can't feel a label. Don't get caught up in that shit. There's so much something in life. Don't get caught up in the nothing. That shit is nothing, you know? It's nothing. Vanish the fear.
As we make our way back from Astoria, Ocean tells me that he's got at least five projects in the works, 
among them a song he wrote for Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained; songs he's working on for Alicia Keys and Beyoncé;
 songs for his own third album; and a European tour, which he says he wants to model on Pink Floyd's The Wall tour. He's even thinking about maybe opening his own arcade (though later he'll post on Tumblr that this idea is "morphing").
He is considering buying a place in New York City. He needs a break from L.A.'s relentless sunshine, he says, and right now Manhattan is giving him exactly that: The rain is coming down in sheets.
 We pull up to his SoHo hotel, and he asks if we can idle while he runs in to get "studio-ready." A few minutes later, he emerges, laptop in hand. He's switched his contacts out for glasses and changed into what looks like board shorts and another Supreme hoodie, this one maroon. It's 9 p.m. on a Friday as we head back to Jungle City. 
Pharrell is out in Brooklyn, waiting for Jay-Z to take the stage. But not Ocean. He has a song to write.

I'm back at it. Automatic
I'm back at it. Automatic
Let's go
[Verse 1]
Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
I know its obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You seem to move fame or 
get the money bringing you down
Everywhere I go its a media frenzy
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Is the story real? You don't even know
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
[Bridge]
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me
[Hook]
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
I'm losing focus, focus, focus
I gotta get back to the money
[Verse 1]
[Bridge]
[Hook]
I'm back at it. Automatic
I'm back at it. Automatic

Zac Bayly: 
Frank Ocean: Hey Zack, How's it going?
Are you an 
I actually suck with accents. I wouldn't have been able to tell.
Um...just hanging out with my little brother. He's about to be twelve.
Yeah. How about you? Do you have any brothers and sisters?
16 and 20? Nice.
Yeah, I get along with him. He is just a kid but...He's funny. He's got a good sense of humour.
I've kinda been obsessed with old Aretha Franklin stuff.
'Daydreaming'...I'm really distracted today.
 You know if I didn't live in LA I would have a much more refined daily dress-code. But since I live here...The weather's great, but it's also a little forbidding in the sense that I can't wear a tonne of layers all the time and be really...
Be really posh and shit - wear stuff of that nature.
See, I'm with you! I'm actually...I was looking at a place in Notting Hill. I'm kind of obsessed with the idea of moving. I'm kind of obsessed with that. I'm gonna make the move.
I'm at a store for pants.
Pants that hide my legs and my privates.
[Laughs] They are.
Yeah, you can't just go and buy new pants. And then, when you discover the pants, it's this euphoric feeling all throughout your body, because you know you found the right pants [laughs].
I went to Tokyo, and apart from it being really hot and humid, it was one of my favorite trips. I wasn't going there for a show or anything. I was just going there to hang out. I'd been there for a couple weeks, and there's just something about the pride that they take in their work. That, I kind of gravitate towards. I mean, not to make my response too simple, but that's probably at the core of why I like so much of what comes out of that part of the world. They have that attitude towards their work: pride and presentation...
I feel like that's somewhat natural progression for the ambitious. They imagine themselves in a position before they've actually done the work to be in that position. So, the fantasy of the imagining is like...You know, it's the whole chicken or the egg thing [both laugh]. You're right, though - it has to be work first.
You're right; you're right. And even...Well, I think what you've said is correct. You have to be 'work first' for the benefit of the whole system that you're a part of. People need to direct their energy towards making something great and useful, you know? It should be common sense but...It's not! [Laughs]
Yeah, I can relate to that -- I can relate to both sides of that, 
because at different times in my life...hmmm. How do I say this?
 
You know, I didn't ever have a disciplinarian in my creative life. As a young person I didn't have — for lack of a better word — I didn't have a Joe Jackson in my family. I didn't have that sort of overbearing stage-parent… Or, even, I didn't even have a parent who encouraged what I did in that way. And — don't bring out the string section. It's not really sad — what it did foster is… Well, my attitude was pure.
 
I love to make music, and I love to write. It was writing first.
 I love to write and express myself in that medium, so that was the pure part — just the love of doing something, but there was also this fantasy of what the lifestyle would be and what the trappings of success would be. There are different little montage clips that you make up in your mind, like what a day in the life would be like once you're a fully grown whatever-you're-going-to-become, you know?
Yeah — yeah. I think that was me, but there was a transition — and it wasn't like I just woke up and had an epiphany, but it was a transition where I began to realise that if I didn't really begin to focus on the work, I couldn't see any way for me to become who I wanted to become. It just wasn't gonna happen. And then somewhere in that time of my life it was like… Instead of wanting to get to a certain level of fame or how much liquid assets I had under my name, it was more like, "How well can I develop my skill set?" You know? "How far can I push my creativity? If I'm gonna do this — if I'm gonna be a singer/songwriter — then OK, I'm a singer/songwriter, but how can I be the best?"
And I was just zoning in on that, not zoning in on being the best networker [laughs]; not zoning in on being anything other than that. Once I moved here it was about that. It was a shift to, "I don't care about anything else right now. I just wanna know how to be the best". That was the most life-changing shift perspective.
Writing is most certainly an art form - and you have to have to keep balancing, juggling like circus actors, negotiating between the business and the craft...I'd almost lean towards saying that's an art form in and of itself also.
Yes, I'd agree. Stimulating is the perfect word [laughs].
The worst thing I've been called...hmmm. I mean, it's less about what someone calls you, and more about who's calling you that. So, I don't know the answer to that question. I'm a bit impervious to the things that people say, depending on who's saying it.
Right. Yeah, I'm fairly aware of that. I try to unflip things and have thick skin no matter what people are saying, but when people are closer to you...You know, you get into a spat with someone you care about, and they say some shit they don't mean, or that they do mean, which makes it more emotional, but...You know - you get over it.
[Laughs]
Oprah doesn't have a catchphrase, does she?
[Still laughing] She does! She actually really does have a facial expression that she uses a lot!
You need to learn how to cry.
Nabil's cool. He's a cool guy. I feel like he should spend more time in war zones taking photos. You know, some people I meet, I feel like they just don't belong in LA. He's one of those people. He needs a more intense environment.
Do I feel like I belong in LA? Hmmm...Here's my feeling about LA: LA is this massive place, and you get so many types of lifestyles and shit here; you find all these pockets. Take my friend who lives in Malibu, for example - I think that's still LA County. So he lives in LA, but he lives in a place that doesn't look like it's in LA. For all intents and purposes he isn't in the same LA that I live in at my place in Hollywood - we might as well be a state apart considering how different it is. So, I can see myself belonging in certain 
 of LA.
Like, when I say that about Nabil, I feel like Nabil doesn't belong anywhere in LA County. Nabil belongs in Saint Petersburg, Russia, for a little while, or he belongs in a war zone taking iconic photos - risking his life for the shot. I think I could use a couple of years away from this city - I think I could definitely use a couple of years away from this city. Seven years is a long time.
[The Phone cuts out, so Zac calls Frank back]
What's your middle name?
Yes.
Zachary Cameron Bayly. There was a bully in my elementary school named Bailey.
At my middle school, actually.
[Laughs] I didn't get bullied, but he was a bully. I was never a bully.
I was a thug. I sold a lot of cocaine and crack.
All the time.
Yup.
You weren't as cool as me?
 is good.
Um…
[Frank's voice becomes garbled and the call cuts out. From that point on, Zac's calls go to voicemail]

[Verse 1]
I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complementing you
You love attention from a big crowd
It's like I'm on the sideline
Right next to suckah and I am the bustah girl
Who's thise other guy, that's sending you these flowers
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend
[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you
To myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I just call it my greedy love
Greedy love(x2)
Oh my greedy love
[Verse 2]
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girl's night
Feels like I'm riding the bench
Right next to suckah and I am the bustah girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You've see my blown fuse cause everybody's on you
[Hook]
Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love (x2)
Oh my greedy love
Greedy love (x2)
Oh my greedy love
[Bridge]
The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Though it seems like I'm nagging oh
Is wanting only me too much to ask
[Hook]
When all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love (x2)
Oh my greedy love
Greedy love (x2)
Oh my greedy love

home. i put my bag down. leave my shoes where they land. pull my shirt over my head.
 
hang it on the ironing board
. 
fall into this white nautica comforter my mom bought from marshall’s when she came in town to see me last
. 
home is currently in beverly hills.
 
a well executed renovation project not far from wilshire theatre.
 
i like this place. rent’s two grand. expensive. refrigerator’s stainless. countertops are granite
. 
living room floors are travertine.
 
bedroom floors are hardwood.
 it’s a nice space. beige walls with nothing on them. but an ignorant television or two. a mural i did by hand when i was heartbroken 
and a completely arbitrary photo of odb in the bathroom above the toilet. my favorite piece.
 i got one closet and more articles of clothing than i need or wear. options are good. i’ve never been notably organized or tidy. so a large percentage of my wardrobe is usually strewn across my bed or that aforementioned ironing board. i keep my bathroom clean. kitchen too sort of. i eat out so much that the only issue i really have is perishables perishing in the icebox. oh and my fish died recently. i still haven’t emptied his tank. damn. a nice lady named mayra comes by a couple times a month and cleans up for me. it’s the best eighty dollars i spend everytime. i built out a project studio in my living room. the mess of wires is starting to become a nuisance though. i’ve probably recorded at home less times than i can count on my hands. i have made a couple beats though. beats which i’ve played for no one but frank. i’m reading three books at once. well not really. but you get it. which one i pick up at the end of my night sort of depends on my mood. i’m furthest along in the one about an african kid who moves to america after his family is killed and his country is destroyed by civil war. his story is hardly imaginable. i appreciate the relative calm in my life by the time i put it down. 
i used to be addicted to cnn. nowadays my tv is either off or being used as a monitor for my mac in the living room.
 
except on sunday nights when entourage is in season.
 
i read magazines a lot. they’re my favorite. i have no subscriptions. last time i counted i had near a thousand bucks worth of magazines stacked next to my sofa. newsstands must love me. i’m impulsive as fuck. damn. that’s bad. i’m gonna try and subscribe online somewhere or something. i’ve got a lot of music here too.
 
lately i’ve been going to amoeba and buying oldies but goodies that i’d never heard before.
 
i must admit those have been my most wise purchases this summer. smarter than my car note for sure. sade’s love deluxe might indirectly buy me a g550 one day. a house to park it in front of too probably. no bullshit.
 i’ll sleep now. maybe i won’t wake up till morning. maybe i’ll wake up shortly. 
either way i’ll pray.
 and i’ll dream.

Oh oh oh my.. oh yeah
Yeah yeah oh oh love 
love
 love.. yeah
Hollywood, Hollywood..
Heard you like to take the love
That’s why I.. came to town..
With only my brain
Holly baby
Baby, (yeah) baby, yeah..
Why do you drive the talent crazy, crazy..
Yeah..
When they call you home
Their home.. their home, yeah.. (x2)
And they come from far away to meet ya
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home.. Yeah, yeah..
And you drive them crazy
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood.. oohh
I met you on the TV screen
You told me you were single and
We talked about the weather babe
You said it never rains in southern Cali..
Baby.. baby..
Why do you drive the talent crazy..
Yeah, baby yeah..
When they call you home
Their home.. their home, yeah.. (x2)
And they come from far away to meet ya
Then you break their hearts in pieces
They call you home
Their home, their home, yeah, yeah..
And you drive em crazy..
Holly baby, Holly baby, Hollywood.. Oohh yeah

(Verse 1)
Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain’t a better way to say
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain’t here
(Pre-Chorus)
So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same
(Chorus)
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still
I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn’t matter
And this money ain’t distracting me much at all
(Pre-Chorus)
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same
(Chorus)
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you
(Bridge)
Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain’t easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I’m alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart
(Chorus)
The hardest thing to say is what I ain’t saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can’t run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

My flag is American, but I love some Queen
I'm young enough to vote, and toke the trees
I'll be playing concerts in the mud, until the sequel
I'll be finding subjects to paint in the buff, behind the easel

How high, tell me how high shall we jump
How far, really how far have we come

I was wondering were we better off before

Who needs you, who needs you
Who loves you, who doesn't
What you say
You need say

Barely been to Pasadena

My passion for this music yo, it's far too deep
I rest for 3 hours a day, 4 and an half if I'm lucky
4:45 in the mornin and I'm the only one up see
I'm all about the hustle, Hodgy 'bout his grind
And y'all no longer struggle once you make up your mind
I had up my mind and now I'm takin my time
Steady niggas takin from mine, 
I recordin out in space
Spendin time, lendin rhymes
Out and hand mixtapes to a fan giving and gettin grams

Man kind wouldn't be realistin if no one dreamed

With no remembering you
We fall out in the winter

Zip-Lock maranaded, cook it if you care to take it
There's time now to bake it, mama show me how you make it
Bring me to life with those icing covered knives
Single handedly raised us, sacrifice and had to fight for
Pages to raised us, loveres is what made us
Today trust we always got steel

We gettin laid, smooth (damn)
It's heartbreak plus jetlag
Heartbreak plus jetlag ooh..
Heartbreak plus jetlag ooh..

[Verse 1:Frank Ocean]
I got a question 
I wanna ask my momma
But shes been gone for some years now
I need the answers I want to ask my friends
But they're to cool to be honest
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
It just might break her heart man
I can't ask my girl
[Hook]
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
Am I in love?
[Verse 2:Frank Ocean]
Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
And am I standing in it?
I sing along to every single word though
And I feel like I need them
Cause for all I know
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
But I gotta know for sure
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
And I'mma ask Donny
And I'mma ask Stevie
And I'mma ask Prince
If I'm in love
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
If I'm in love
My headphones won't lie if I'm in love
Tell me tell me
Am I in love?

[Hook:]
Thought that I was dreamin'
When you said you loved me
Yes, it started from nothing
Had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
And it started from nothing
Oooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate you now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down, is good
You broke my heart last week
I'll probably feel better
But if we can still remember how you'd hold me
As you're screaming my name
The feeling deep down is good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good
It's all good, all good, all good
It's all good, all good
[Verse 1:]
If I could see through walls
I could see you faking
If you could see my thoughts
You would see our faces
Safe in my rental
Like an armor truck
Nah, nah, we ain't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more
I'll never be a kid again
We'd try to see if Heaven exists back then, back then
No matter what I did
My waves wouldn't dip back then
Life was chill as fuck back then
We were friends...
[Hook:]

Look up, look up, look up
You’ll see the last line in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can
(Bridge)
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they, come crashing down
It’ll be, the worst surprise
(Chorus)
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
Till you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming
Feels like I’m on the 30th floor
Starring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You’re marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun
(Bridge)
Oh, right now they’re flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they, come crashing down
It’ll be, the worst surprise
(Chorus)
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see ‘em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
Till you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming
Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They’re coming down, coming down
They’re coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up
(Chorus)
But you just right stand there
You ain’t looking ‘round
And baby, you won’t never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they’re way down to you
But you won’t never see 'em
Oh no, you’ll never know he’s lying
Till you look up
And I bet you’d catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you’ll never see it coming
You’ll never see it coming
Look up, look up
And baby you’ll see the light
You’ll see him flying
Look up, look up
You’ll see the lies
No, look up, look up
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
Flight 143 was just on the ground

I catch Z's at work now
So they're gonna fire me soon
But I've been dreamin' of our love
I wish my new day job was you
[Chours]
But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart. (not your heart)
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart. (not my heart)
But if my job was only to love you, yeahh
There wouldn't be no Recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
If my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no stressin'
Be no stressin', Ain't no pressure
Cause it pays way better babe
It pays way better baby, yeahh
My boss works my nerves girl
If you knew him you'd wanna quit too
I just know he's jealous
Cause he's lonely and I've got you
(But what I'mma do)
[Repeat Chours]
If I left this place today with the love that we made
I'd be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life
I love you the rest of my life, oh
Be paid for the rest of my life
Ohhh ohhh ohhhh ohhh ohhhh

Ohh
Ohh
Every girl that I met on tour
I knew none of them would last
Cause it wouldn’t work, nah it wouldn’t work
A hundred chick contacts in my phone
About half of them I smashed
I put in work, oh I put in work
But there's something missin' there though
Feels like I've gotta lambo with no gas to go
And I've got all the world, nothing to show
That girl just let me know
[Hook]
I need love
Yeah, I need you, yeah I need you
I need love
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
I need love in the morning
In the afternoon
I need love all night, all night
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Need love
Two weeks ago
I would've never admit I had it bad, oh
I wouldn't do it, nah no
Cause 15 days ago
Never knew you, so never knew how this felt
Had no clue, I was too cool
But now I can't go a day without ya'
I wake up eating breakfast thinking 'bout ya'
We'll go around the world, don't ever go
No, don't ever leave me 'lone
[Hook]
I wanna wake up from this dream
No sleep full of dreams, I'll stay
And I know it'll work girl
There's no where I'd rather be
Because I need
[Hook]
Baby in the night
Oh

[Verse 1:]
One winter morning I went for a drive, I stopped somewhere between June & July
I love these warmer days
But maybe I can't see that the snow's still falling
I only see the gift my heart just brought me
(Merry Christmas babe) That's what she said
She didn't have to do much, but she made me smile
December in Manhattan feels like South Beach now
I love my baby, ohh yes I do
[Hook:]
It ain't about you givin' anything, as long as you're my everything
Cause lady what could you give to me better than what you've been givin me
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right here if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)
[Verse 2:]
It's just a regular morning, I'm a regular guy
Takin' the train to my 9 to 9
(But something's different today)
I had an envelope sittin' right next to my breakfast
And it's from my baby, not the bill collectors
(Happy Birthday Babay)
Then it said... I know we don't got much but baby we got us
And after you get off, we gon' make sweet love
Now go and get that cake (ohhh yeah)
[Hook:]
[Verse 3:]
One day the whole world will hear me sing
Then I'mma run and buy you those things
But right now, three months pay barely gets me a diamnond baby
But one day I'mma buy you that ring
Ohhhh
[Hook:]
Just keep talkin' in my ear, cause I need it
And tell me you'll be right there if I need ya
The greatest present you could give is the present (ohhh, I need it)
(
Nothing but everything)
(I don't need anything, long as you're my everythinng)

[Verse 1]
I thought that things like this get better with time
But I still need you, why is that?
You're the only image in my mind
So I still see you, around
[
Hook]
I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
Said I miss you, I miss you insane
If I got with you, would it feel the same
[Verse 2]
Words don't ever seem to come out right
But I still mean them, why is that?
It hurts my pride to tell you how I feel
But I still need to, now why is that?
[Hook]
Oh it's cause I miss you, like everyday
Wanna be with you, but you're away
I said I miss you, I miss you insane
But if I got with you, would it feel the same
[Verse 3]
And it don't matter who you are
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everythin
g
No matter who you love
It is so simple, a feeling
But it's everything

She gone!

Before the day I die?
She asked me questions
I asked her "why?"
She said, "I love you"
No reply

Me
But we could've been something special
Just know you always got a special place in my, in my, in my
I guess you can just spend it all on me

[Verse 1:]
I just wanna make love [3X]
Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
Imma hit a few keys bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now (ow)
Fix you up another Mai Thai (Thai)
No sun on the horizon (on)
Let's make a song for the night time (time)
[Hook:](x2)
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
[Verse 2:]
Stroke of harmony kiss you on your neck
I'm changin up your voice sound (changin up your sound)
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
And make you climax now (ahh ahh)
Now we switching up the melody (ay!)
We take it down to a minor stage (stage)
We making noise like we can't believe (ay)
Let's put this moment on replay
[Hook:]
[Bridge:]

Girl whatcha you wanna doooooo
You wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
[Hook:]

(Aye, Listen)
Hey let me tell you something
Don't be frontin like he ever did it like I does it
Every time you wanna argue and stress
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
Well I guess you coulda
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda
Cuz when you was with him
You was always checking for the kid
Late night coming to my crib
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better
So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
 (Cuz it's just for you)
I'm tryin to settle down (Tell me who)
You know could make you smile (Like I can do)
Tell me who, tell me who
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I know that you'll never finda
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better
So, so, so
Baby I know
That without you I'd be broken down
But you'd feel the same
If I went away
Why can't you just say it?
Just say it! Just say it!
Forget it baby, it's cool
Cuz I already know
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
Like me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

[Intro]
Crazy, I plead insanity
Crazy for you, baby
[Verse 1]
Talk to me and I better not hear a word
Do me baby, I better not feel it girl
Baby, I still got one bullet left in my nine
Finna do a lovecrime, lovecrime, finna do a lovecrime
[Hook]
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Lovecrimes, lovecrimes
[Verse 2]
You write me love letters with your father's pen
If he knew the freaky, freaky things that you write with it
Is it really wrong that I want to be the baby daddy?
Is that a lovecrime, lovecrime? Tell me it's a lovecrime
[Hook]
[Bridge]
In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two
[Hook]
[Outro]
Millions of years of evolution, right? Right!? Men have to stick it in every place they can, but for women it's just about security, and commitment, and- and whatever the fuck else!
If you men only knew
Your not the jealous type are? You’ve never been jealous about me have you? and why haven’t you ever been jealous be? you… are very sure of yourself aren’t you”

Stop the truck, held my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone
How to get distracted I
Don't know what happened I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got away away you flew away away ooooh
I lost my Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?) She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my Angel? Where'd you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
Oh, Angel tell me what am I to do?
Angel I can't find another you
Angel search downtown, now
 
I'm on the 10 West
Doing 90 tryna get to you
Exit La Cienega,
 I'm looking, I'm searching
La Brea,
 
Santa Monica
, Sunset,
 
Sepulveda
Robertson,
 
Melrose
 
and Hollywood
I lost my Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?) She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my Angel? Where'd you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?) She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my Angel? Where'd you go?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

[Verse 1]
Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this
[Hook]
Now you're lost
Lost in the heat of it all
Girl you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam
Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India
Lost on a train, lost
[Verse 2]
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
Too weird to live, too rare to die
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever
Have I ever let you get caught?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
She's at a stove
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope
I promise she'll be
Whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
No nothing wrong with a lie
Nothing wrong with another short plane ride
(Nothing wrong, ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky
Up in the sky
You and I
Just you and I
[Hook]
[Outro]
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost?
Love love
Love lost
Love love
Love lost
Faith is the substance
Then the other channel on the

living. it’s a plain difference from dead.
 
seen a dead body this afternoon.
 
the people who felt they had that body in their lives, have to let it go.
 
the memories of the life that used that body are just as finite as the bodies of those who remember him.
 
the woman or man that enjoyed that mans body, will only have the thin almost holographic recollections for as long as they live.
 
then again, who knows how long we live,
 
and if life goes on after these heartbeats stop.
 
who knows where life went when it left that body. who knows if it went anywhere, not you.
 
matters of faith, are matters of faith and faith is not knowing.
 
what i know is that when i see a body without life, i feel sort of childish. a kid in a big complicated existence.
 
a game with no rules and no point of winning other than for the sport of it.
 
like the things i know and have learned mean nothing really.
 
a feeling of confusion about the point.
 
a bone chilling awareness of my mortality.
 
still i wanna live. live and bring other lives into this world to live and die as well.
 
some would say we are one consciousness divided.
 
i would say we’ll find out. but we do not know that.
 
eh. life. where’s my fuckin lighter.

[Intro] x9
Memorize
[Verse]
I memorized the wayward expressions
Never look down
Never let you see me down
I memorized the way no directions
Can I come over now
I'd like to stay a little while
I memorized your body exposed
I can fuck you all night long
From a memory alone
I never forget a face
Don’t go plastic on me
Nothing’s set in stone
You're not dipped in gold
Dipped in gold
You can’t breathe if you’re dipped in gold
You are not on paper
You are not a copy
You're so, you're so..so thick, so thick

Girl when I met you
The numbers were runnin' through my head
I could've wrote down your number
But I memorized them instead, ooh
And on the first date remember the minutes spent together
You called me Rainman then kissed me for three seconds
Ooh, no one else has ever fit the equation quite like you
[Hook]
White picket fence and house to make love
Two kids and a dog named Doug
Thanksgiving dinner so fast in the winter
Get us on a truck, crib, and a Cadillac
?
It's all about trust, it's all about trust
It equals love, equals love
Part of the math, part of the math
Part of the math, part of it all
Part of the math, part of the math
The math, the math, the math, the math
[Verse 2]
You see, if colors were numbers, you’d be a fuchsia seven
And I'd be a platinum three,
 
and we could be a ten together
Oh, and I don't ever want to part, subtraction or division
And if you ever left
I'd go full calculus to get you back, back, back
Cause the fact is, no one else quite fit the equation like that
[Hook]
[Break]
I said, one plus one says it equals two
Baby me and you only equals love (It equals love, it equals love)
If one means one then it just ain't two
And it can't be love cause it's only one
[Hook]
[Break]

Sweet king Martin, sweet queen Coretta
Sweet brother Malcolm, sweet queen Betty
Sweet Mother Mary, sweet father Joseph
Sweet Jesus, we made it in America
Sweet baby Jesus, oh sweet baby Jesus
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I told my mama I was on the come up
She said, "You going to school, I’ll give you a summer"
Then she met No I.D. and gave me his number
Ten years later she driving a Hummer
Niggas hustle every day for a beat from Ye
What I do? Turn around gave them beats to Jay
And I’m rapping on the beat they was supposed to buy
I guess I’m getting high off my own supply
Downtown mixing fabrics tryna find the magic
Started a little blog just to get some traffic
Old folks’ll tell you not to play in traffic
A million hits and the web crashes, damn!
South Park had them all laughing
Now all my niggas designing and we all swaggin’
Ignore the critics just to say we did it
This ain’t no fashion show mothafucka, we live it
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
I pledge allegiance to my Grandma
For that banana pudding, our piece of Americana
Our apple pie was supplied through Arm and Hammer
Straight out the kitchen, shh, don’t wake Nana
Built a republic that still stands
I’m tryna lead a nation, to leave to my little man's
Or my daughter, so I’m boiling this water
The scales was lopsided, I’m just restoring order
Hold up, here comes grandma, what’s up Yaya?
What’s that smell? Oh I’m just boiling some agua
No papa, bad Santa
The streets raised me, pardon my bad manners
I got my liberty chopping grams up
Street justice, I pray God understand us
I pledge allegiance to all the scramblers
This is the Star Spangled Banner
[Hook]

[Verse 1 - Frank Ocean]
I don't know if I ever told you this before, before
But you're the only one I ever waited for this long
And now the room is crowded
, right now
So tell me are you about it, right now?
[Hook - Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's been various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?
[Verse 2 - Frank Ocean]
Got all them couples floating on your pink champagne
You know there's bottle service, bottle service, babe
Long as the DJ's playing all these raunchy songs
Girl, we can do this on the dancefloor all night long
Now I know the room is crowded, right now
But tell me are you about it right now?
[Hook - Frank Ocean]
I've been thinking of you all the time
There's various issues, but would you let me, let me tonight?
See, I've been dreaming of you in the daytime
And it ain't right, so would you let me, let me tonight?
Now listen, don't you get this twisted girl
If I leave you, without you, I miss you girl
And if I had you right now, I wouldn't change a thing
You tell me this ain't what you're used to
But baby can't no man judge you
I can tell ain't no man loving you
I can tell ain't no man loving you

Let me start by saying I feel like an asshole right now,
 
but a tough decision had to be made in regard to my schedule over the next few months.
 
The casualties of that decision include my appearances at upcoming festivals in Europe and my opening slot on the European leg of the Coldplay world tour.
 
Sorry as fuck, I'll be back if you'll have me

Donald Trump said buy an apartment wit her (uh)
Buying an apartment wit ya
Greenspan said the rate was good
My pastor says that your faith is major
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
Like jumping over the broom
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all
They said you love that girl
You need that girl
But don’t you let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin' solo baby?
I know, you told 'em baby
Watch you, you tell 'em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
Your father really likes me
He calls me son
Your brother I think he hates me
But you say thats how you know its right
Your mother invites me to dinner
All of the time
Only thing she’s been grilling is me
Keep telling her I love that girl
I need that girl
I won’t let her go
Not ever, not ever, no
Who goin' solo baby?
I know, you told em baby
Watch you, you tell em baby
It’s cool, it’s cool
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let 'em know them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off
It’s strobing, baby,

But don’t worry baby, just stay close to me
They flashing, it’s like dynamite
This love will keep us about 
55 degrees
Don’t mind the lights
Don’t mind the lights
The love is gonna keep us cool
The love is gonna keep us cool
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off
But the lights is gonna be on us
That’s the reason why I kept this love in the dark
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Let em know them lights will never turn off
But it's cool
Cause this love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool
This love will keep us cool

and you will see your entire future.

[Verse 1]
Okay, thought about it for a minute
Can't let love go spinnin' down the drain now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
Simple math, pen & pad; gotta work out
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
But you're my only, baby you're my only
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out
It can't be hard
[Pre-Hook]
You gotta find the answers to the problem
Ain't no answers here without you, no
[Hook]
I been writin' all day, fillin' my page
Tryna fix this, wrackin' my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writin' all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, I can't do it by myself
No love
No love still
No love
[Verse 2]
Okay, I'm gonna tell you everything
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie
You're my homie, baby you're my only
She's the past, you're my future, my right now
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
& I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out girl
I know it's hard
[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work
I can't use an elevator, to get back up to you
To get back up to you
Never had a clue
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I’m knocking on your door, and its cold, yes its cold
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it’s a chore
But I won’t stop loving you that’s for sure, that’s for sure
[Hook]
You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there’s no way, no how I’ll stop loving you
It’s non-stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
It won’t stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain’t gonna slow
It’s non stop, Oh no, oh no, oh no
[Verse 2]
I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I’m still not losing hope, though the skys getting dark
I wish you’d just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that’s a start
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Said I’m sorry, oh baby
But the love won’t stop, no no, nah uh
Take me back, oh love, Take me back
Cause the love will keep flowing on
The love will keep flowing on

Human beings in a mob
What's a mob to a king? What's a king to a God?
What's a God to a non-believer who don't believe in anything?
Will he make it out alive? Alright, alright, no church in the wild
[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Tears on the mausoleum floor
Blood stains the Colosseum doors
Lies on the lips of a priest
Thanksgiving disguised as a feast
Rolling in the Rolls Royce Corniche
Only the doctors got this, I’m hiding from police
Cocaine seats, all white like I got the whole thing bleached
Drug dealer chic,
 
I’m wondering if a thug’s prayers reach
Is Pious pious cause God loves pious?
Socrates asked whose bias do y'all seek?
All for Plato, screech
I’m out here balling, I know y'all hear my sneaks
Jesus was a carpenter, Yeezy he laid beats
Hova flow the Holy Ghost, get the hell up out your seats, preach
[Hook]
[Bridge: The-Dream]
I live by you, desire
I stand by you, walk through the fire
Your love is my scripture
Let me into your encryption
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Coke on her black skin
Made a stripe like a zebra, I call that jungle fever
You will not control the threesome
Just roll the weed up until I get me some
We formed a new religion
No sins as long as there’s permission
And deception is the only felony
To never fuck nobody without telling me
Sunglasses and Advil, last night was mad real
Sun coming up, 5 a.m., I wonder if they got cabs still?
Thinking 'bout the girl in all leopard
Who was rubbing the wood like Kiki Shepherd
Two tattoos: one read "No Apologies"
The other said "Love is Cursed by Monogamy"
It’s something that the pastor don’t preach
It’s something that a teacher can’t teach
When we die the money we can’t keep
But we probably spend it all cause the pain ain’t cheap: preach
[Hook]

Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'mma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'mma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars

if i could dream about this place right now that’d be nice.
 had a dream about obama and some missing kid last night. 
i was in a warehouse fight scene too for some reason. like a jackie chan 
 type thing.
 
i think it’s because i watched too much tv yesterday
. 
i mean, I'mma lil sick so i saw more of the tv yesterday than i would normally see in a week. that shit messes with your mind man.

alrite. alrite. let’s get this out in the open. the only songs that i, myself, frank ocean, have ever released are…
’pyrite’,
 
‘acura integurl’
 
& of course the songs included on ‘nostalgia, ultra’.
 all other songs are on the internet as a result of record industry email hacks/leaks that happened some years back. several of these songs i had no hand in writing. i only laid reference vox on em because i was being paid. the rest are incomplete ideas, reference songs that were sent out for placement on other artists. records that were never intended to represent me. notwithstanding, i am a chill bro. as well as a sage/zen master in training. so im not angry or anything. i just had to let it at least be known. 
enjoy.


currently on a long ass plane ride. going through my own little existential crisis.
 
i wish i could talk to you all as friends. & im tempted, but the truth is you’re a mixed crowd. so i’ll spare the details… for now.
 
unfortunately this emo shit is running concurrently with the most progressive weeks of my career so far.
 
i’d like to enjoy the success more. but.. i am experiencing success. which is more than many could ever say.
 
i don’t have any noteworthy or overwhelming gripes about this business. i may call certain people/institutions out for their bullshit from time to time.
 
but the way i see it i make a decent living doing exactly what the fuck i want. how could i not be grateful?
 besides, i’m not famous. maybe a little popular. i do think social networks can make you feel a little bit more poppin than you actually are though. hahaha. anyhow, 
im gonna get a dog soon. i know it might not make sense.. i mean i’ll be/have been traveling a lot more frequently than i’m used to. but the companionship just might keep me off the proverbial ‘ledge’.
 
what do you think of this guy?

[Verse 1]
Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch Westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She’s on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me
Wave em high girl to the sky
But you’re beautiful to me
Live in the clouds
Wave em high girl, to the sky
But you’re beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high ya’ll
Beautiful stars
In the sky
[Verse 2]
Monks in the mosh pit
Stage diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they’re gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra
I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We’ve got no choices left
The running’s fast
Run run run run
You’re beautiful to me
Run run run run you’d better run
You mean so much to me
In my world
[Verse 3]
We made it safely
Even with your father’s army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archer’s bows at our backs
What a great escape
But theres a long way still in fact
We’re lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There’s a monsoon that never ends
A coke white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us til the end
We’re in the clouds
Wave em high now to the sky
But you’re beautiful to me
Keep em high ya’ll show you right
But you’re beautiful to me
Beautiful

MY RANDOM
I miss all the tension
When all this is over
I’m moving t
o ghana
You sus and you wat
ching me
They used to be brown
Now them contacts is green
Why the fucks u finessing me
I know how many licks
It’ll take me to get
To the center of ecstasy
How come the ecstasy
Only depresses me so
Chemically I don’t have
Any new places to go
Every face looks pale
When the seraton’ gets a lil low
When they lower my coffin
Bet a few bitches jumpin in the hole
Few old ones that I left alone
I never lie cus I don’t remember
No tales cus it’s two heads
Even twelve got a lil forgiveness
Who do you love?

my homie nabil
 
flew out to somalia this past week to photograph and bring awareness to the famine unfolding out there.. a famine set to affect some 12 million people.
 
there’s a few ways to donate money,
 
but simply spreading the word is pretty helpful too. peace.

[Verse 1]
I've been meaning to fuck you in the garden
Been breathing so hard, we both could use the oxygen
Just hop on my back, I'll take you down the stairs
Into my backyard and lay you right on the grass
[Hook]
Give it you over again, over again
Over again over again
Making love, underneath the cherry leaves
Baby girl, tell me how my nature feels
Said oh baby, up against the cherry tree
Baby girl, I'll give it to you naturally, naturally
[Verse 2]
Feeling like Adam when he first found out this existed (Wow)
Me and my Eve trying out our first positions
And it's all good, and it's all free, and it's all you, and it's only me
Playing in the dirt wrestling myself inside you
[Hook]
[Bridge]
My cavewoman, I'm a caveman
Doing wild things in a wild land
We keep going baby, we keep getting it baby
We'll get pebbles maybe a couple bam bams
Bam bam, bang bang, girl your heart
Goes bam and bang, feel my heart go, go, go

I’ll stack these magazines in the corner
After I’m done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you’ll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing
(Bridge)
How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I’m older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?
(Chorus)
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left - nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so
We didn’t make love
We celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye
(Bridge)
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don’t last…
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I’m older, and my mind’s telling me to forget you
What’s gonna make me remember?
(Chorus)
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss you
No videos, no polaroids
No record of the love we had
My Nikon wasn’t fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know
(Chorus)
That’s why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
Cause I didn’t wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so…

[Verse 1]
My momma was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes you would have thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that "Don't touch anything in the store"
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that "Come in, please buy more"
"What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things"
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New Slaves
[Bridge]
You see there's leaders and there's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower
[Verse 2]
I throw these Maybach keys
I wear my heart on the sleeve
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I see the blood on the leaves
I know that we the new slaves
I see the blood on the leaves
They throwin' hate at me
Want me to stay at ease
Fuck you and your corporation
Y'all niggas can't control me
I know that we the new slaves
I know that we the new slaves
I'm 'bout to wild the fuck out
I'm goin' Bobby Boucher
I know that pussy ain't free
You niggas pussy, ain't me
Y'all throwin' contracts at me
You know that niggas can't read
Throw 'em some Maybach keys
Fuck it,
 
c'est la vie
I know that we the new slaves
Y'all niggas can't fuck with me
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
Y'all niggas can't fuck with 'Ye
I'll move my family out the country
So you can't see where I stay
So go and grab the reporters
So I can smash their recorders
See they'll confuse us with some bullshit
Like the New World Order
Meanwhile the DEA
Teamed up with the CCA
They tryna lock niggas up
They tryna make new slaves
See that's that privately owned prison
Get your piece today
They prolly all in the Hamptons
Braggin' 'bout what they made
Fuck you and your Hampton house
I'll fuck your Hampton spouse
Came on her Hampton blouse
And in her Hampton mouth
Y'all 'bout to turn shit up
I'm 'bout to tear shit down
I'm 'bout to air shit out
Now what the fuck they gon' say now?
[Outro: Kanye West & Frank Ocean]
I won't end this high, not this time again
So long, so long, so long,
 
you cannot survive
And I'm not dyin', and I can't lose
I can't lose, no, I can't lose
Cause I can't leave it to you
So let's get too high, get too high again
(Too high again, too high)
[Kóbor János]
Egyszer a Nap úgy elfáradt
Elaludt mély zöld tó ölén
Az embereknek fájt a sötét
Ő megsajnált, eljött közénk

[Verse 1:]
I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cus I got her
[Hook]
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie I'm sorry so sorry
[Verse 2:]
I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glove-box
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cus I got her
[Hook] (repeat twice w/adlibs)
No Bonnie
[Bridge:]
The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby
My Bonnie, My Bonnie
[Hook](repeat twice w/adlibs)
[Outro]
No Bonnie
No Bonnie, I'm sorry
So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie

[Verse 1]
I think I started something, I got what I wanted
Did, didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping,
 
every single record autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion, pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, aww
Stripper booty and a rack like wow,
 
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella,
 
I went to see Jigga,
 
she went to see Z Trip,
 
perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn,
 
she handed me a ice blue bong,
 
whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly,
 
she's in school paying
For tuition,
 
doing porn in the Valley, at least you working
But girl I can't feel my face, what are we smoking anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste,
 
but can you taste a little taste
[Hook]
Novacane, baby, baby, Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none, numb, numb, numb, numb
[Verse 2]
Sink full of dishes pacing in the kitchen,
 
cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod, little red light on shooting
I'm feeling like Stanley Kubrick, this is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut but it keeps on moving
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with the rack like wow, I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feeling I never had, never had, never had
And ever since I've been tryna get it back, pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around, quite like what I found in you
I still can't feel my face, what am I smokin' anyway
She said don't let the high go to waste but can you taste a little taste of
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Novacane for the pain
[Outro]
Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me pretty, pity pity
I can't feel a thing
I can't feel her
Novacane for the pain

[Intro]
(You see this motherfucking face)
Blessings, blessings, yeah, I see..
[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Elephant tusk on the bow of a sailing lady, docked on the Ivory Coast
Mercedes in a row winding down the road
I hope my black skin don't dirt this white tuxedo before the Basquiat show
And if so, well fuck it, fuck it
Because this water drown my family,
 
this water mixed my blood
This water tells my story,
 
this water knows it all
Go ahead and spill some champagne in the water
Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Dope boy still smelling like 
White boat, white robe,
 
can he be more cleaner?
The oil spill that BP ain't clean up
I'm anti-
Only Christopher we acknowledge is Wallace
I don't even like Washingtons in my pocket
Black card go hard when I'm shopping
Boat dock in front of Hermes picking cotton
Silk and fleeces,
 
lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick
See me in shit you never saw
If it wasn't for these pictures they wouldn't see me at all
Aww, whole world's in awe
I crash through glass ceilings, I break through closed doors
I'm on the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, 
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
Me and Ty Ty is like Pablo and Popeye
Winding dirt roads on mopeds spilling Opus
Welcome to the magnum opus,
 
the 
The best-selling author 
On the holiday playing "Strange Fruit"
If I'mma make it to a billi I can't take the same route
, that's the sound of the border
, and that's the sound of a baller
Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach,
 
I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven
Yachting, 
[Hook]

[Intro: Taco]
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk
[Verse 1: Tyler the Creator]
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel,
 
I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)
[Verse 2: Hodgy Beats]
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos,
 
cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers,
 
dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette,
 
soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KILLHodgy,
 
nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice
[Verse 3: Left Brain]
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace
 
will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl,
 
yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
[Verse 4: Mike G]
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS,
 
exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air,
 
all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things
 
is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham,
 
rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs
 
I got bars
 
and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh
[Verse 5: Domo Genesis]
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot,
 
get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone,
 
stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown,
 
same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots
 
give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up
[Interlude]
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
[Verse 6: Frank Ocean]
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends,
 
smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bi, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
[Interlude: Jasper Dolphin]
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
[Verse 7: Jasper Dolphin]
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat
[Interlude]
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang
 
(Yeah, fuck that)
[Verse 8: Earl Sweatshirt]
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' sarapin
 
and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
(Whoops, whoops!)
 
fuckin' All-American terrorist
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel,
 
so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit,
 
grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin'-ill-apparel-wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers,
 
Four Loko and a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada,
 
drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again,
 
lord of lips
Bored of this,
 
forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't
 
like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'[Verse 1: Frank]
No baby, no baby, don't touch that
Could you please be still? (Baby, STOP)
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing oh oh
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy
[Hook]:
You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two year old terror, a twenty-two year old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two year old terror, twenty-two year old terror
[Verse 2: Frank]
Now you know you should be sleeping, but okay
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed
Cause you been having nightmares
And you need me here
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3: Frank]
You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain't no sugar for you
Well, just a little bit, but
[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
I remember being immortal
I though that I was
I wanted to conquer the world
Before I could drive
I remember when you were born
Ohhh, how happy I was
Cause If it didn't go as I planned it
At least you'd double my chances
[Bridge]
And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)
[Hook]
If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy I'm jealous of you I’ll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time
(O) won't go wasting time
(no) that you won't go wasting time
(o) Won't go wasting time
Don't go wasting it
[Verse 2]
You gotta know you hit the lotto (lotto)
Cause they don't make em like mamma no more
Hug her and tell her that you love her
That's good time spent
And when your outside running
It's ok to as where you're going
So you're never back where you started
Wondering where time went
[Bridge]
And it's no pressure, man
Cause you're special
I know you wanna get big and strong quick
But don't skip one second (Orion)
[Hook]
If I could buy back the years
O-O-Orion
I would empty my pockets here (On everything)
O-Orion
Make my regrets disappear
O-O-Orion
Boy, I'm jealous of you i’ll admit it
But promise big bro one thing
That you won't go wasting time X2
(O) won't go wasting time
(no) that you won't go wasting time
Won't go wasting time
Don't go wasting it

[Verse 1]
I've seen it and I liked it more
I told myself I had to have it
I looked, but I do not touch
Wondering why you walk like that (that that that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, oh
[Pre-Hook 1]
Didn't have a pick up line to use
Way to cool, way too cool
And instead I'm hoping you're watching me too
Like I watched you
[Hook 1]
It took one look
Just that one look
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, couldn't run away from you
No, didn't stop
No, no, just took on look
[Hook 2]
That's a good look baby (baby)
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look
My eyes must have been on drugs
You calling me, check me so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray
[Pre-Hook 2]
You in HD baby
Didn't know what to say
I'm way too cool, way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true
[Hook 1]
[Bridge]
I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel your hands in mine
I wanna grab on your body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine
[Hook 1 x2]
[Hook 2 x2]

i question if i’m built for this game. or if i’m pushing past the limits of my design.
so i’ll say we. why are we so evil to one another?
but i always remember.. fans kill people.

[Verse 1]
I had my feet in the water
& right when I was about to get up suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line & a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom yeah
I said why you gon live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
& what a difference it makes you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe
What a difference it makes it easy to love
[Hook]
The open air makes it easy (so easy) to love
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love
I swear the air’s so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love
[Verse 2]
You said you’re feeling ways
That you never could’ve felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, & you’re kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
& what a difference it makes you’ll see
What a difference it makes to breathe
What a difference it makes it easy to love
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The open air makes it easy (easy) to love
Baby I could show you the world
& the seed that’s inside of my heart baby
Don’t know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won’t go back again
It’s better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you’re floating higher & higher
Don’t ever go under no more
[Hook x2]

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ,oh, oh...
I know I'm not weak, these heavy thoughts
They been on my mind oh I
I got cargo with me
All those memories feel
Like a thousand pounds on my
In my bed trying to sleep
The ceiling lowers down
I feel it on me now
I been moving buses further and further
I just can't do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone
It's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload
Take over for me
Its too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload
Drag my life along by the end of a rope
Trying to make by Im trying
On the other side someone's tuggin hard
They only getting stronger
Balance bricks on shoulders
With the grit in my shoes
I'm not strong enough
Help me up help me out
I been moving buses futher and futher
I just can do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone
It's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload take over for me
Its too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload Overload overload
Take over for me it's too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
I been tryin to hold up the world with both my hands
Been holding the world in both my hands can't hold up the world
It's coming down it's coming ...
Its too heavy for me
Overload overload overload take over for me
Its too heavy for me
Overload overload but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload overload overload
Overload overload overload


As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please
[Verse 9: Tyler the Creator]
OF, shit that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy
 
to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront,
 
knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the nigga in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigga friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches
[Outro]
OFM, banging on your FM
Gnaw, 2011,
 
yeah, Golf Wang

[Verse 1]
Fairy-tales come and take my hand
Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the sound waves
She can feel my every line
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah
[Hook]
So ohh in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby
[Verse 2]
Found a way to whisper in her ear
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah
[Hook]
So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby
So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she plays me
Ohh in love....

[Verse 1]
Intimate scenes, fresh from my dreams
Of a triple X movie scene
I could care less about being seen
A higher self-esteem if you on me
 
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar's so sweet, it'll rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me, yeah
Spoiled crazy
[Hook]
Public display of affection
 
(Got 'em hatin')
Pointin' in our direction (Watch 'em watch 'em)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way
We be at the club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
[Verse 2]
Remember at the beach, we brought the sheets
And were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we meet, the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense, ?
Has got me convinced
You're the fingers to my instrument
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
From the lobby to the patio
 (Boy you're so crazy)
And we so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navajo (You nasty)
And we so compatible
[Break]
The club, the restaraunt
The grocery store or the movie
Kissin' and touchin' with my hands all over ya booty
Wherever it is, yes, I'll love it truly
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
Your PDA-A-A, your PDA-A-A
[Outro]
Your PDA-A-A (I want your PDA)

[Intro]
We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice cold (ice cold!)
You out here flyin' high (high!)
Go head, fly that thing!
High! High!
But fly alone
[Verse 1]
You always smokin' in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known
[Hook]
I know what I was on, I had a Pilot Jones
She took me high, then she took me home
Pilot Jones, Pilot Jones
[Verse 2]
Tonight she came stumblin' across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on tryin' to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reachin' up your blouse and no I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while by the dealer
And the stoner with the sweetest kiss I've ever known
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
Buf if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'mma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my Pilot Jones

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos
You could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy
 
Majin Buu
Close my eyes and fall into you
My god she’s giving me pleasure
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy Majin Buu
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My god giving me pleasure
Pleasure pleasure pleasure
Pleasure over matter
[Verse 3: André 3000]
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all had to tell myself naw
She’s better with some fella with a regular job
I didn’t wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far’s too close and I remember
My memories no sharp
Butter knife,
 
what a life, anyway
I’m building y’all a clock, stop
What am I
 
Hemingway?
She had the kind of body
That would probably intimidate
Any of ‘em that were un-southern
Not me cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddlin’
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend
I need to hold your hand
You’d need no other man
We’d flee to other lands
[Bridge]
Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter
[Outro: André 3000]
You’re good at being bad
You’re bad at being good
For heaven’s sakes go to hell
Nah knock on wood
You’re good at being bad
You’re bad at being good
For heaven’s sakes go to hell
Knock knock knock knock on wood
Well frankly when that ocean so muphucking good
Make her swab the muphucking wood
Make her walk the muphucking plank
Make her rob a muphucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
And the peaches and the mangos
You could sell for me
What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind
This great grey matter
Sensei replied what is your woman

Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter
[Verse 2 - Big Boi]
Doesn't matter if she want to be with me
So it's cool
I make her call me B.B. King because I give her the blues
But not on purpose, though
She was the perfect ho
-stess,
 
when I come over, we would do the grossest
Most beautifulest things on a bed of roses
It would be the coldest when you hit the hardwood floor
We sippin' Yak,
 
not mimosas
She's in my naked lap,
 
going ham
 
like she supposed to
And she could make it clap if I told her
Or make her ass spread like the back of a cobra's
Down there in her titties like a soldier
A G.I. Joe, man
See me, I go in
Ask a bitch, nigga
Yeah, that nigga goes up in it
Like smoke through a chimney
Slow stroke, cause she feeling me
Up in her, miracles
Killing me softly
, 
raw dog she wants me
Strong and black like her coffee
Get off me
Act a donkey, I pin her tail to the mattress
I've been a player
Make her go from classy to nasty
Nasty, nasty, nasty, nasty
To sloosh
[Verse 3 - André 3000]
Since you been gone
I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call

Yeah, bring an amp up here
Let me plug my guitar in
I wanna play for you baby
Can you hear me?
Oh, it's a sold out crowd
I'm kind of nervous
And they yellin' my name out
Can you hear 'em?
[Bridge]
Ooh, oooh, ooooh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (woah oh ohh)
Ooh, oooh, ooooh
You said if I loved you then I would
[Chorus]
Make it a, private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closin', doors are closin', doors are closin'
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that (x2)
I really love my fans
So we gotta move quickly
And once I finish here
Don't shout out encore (Ooh)
You can sing along to my songs, and then
Then I'll applaud you, and then (Ha)
[Bridge]
Ooh, oooh, ooooh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (ohhh woaah ohh)
Ooh, oooh, ooooh
You said if I loved you then I would

Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show

Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a, private show, said you want a, private show

Live so much better than the radio, bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio, bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio, bet-better than the radio
Live so much better, live so much better

Private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here

[Outro]

[Hook]
Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra
[Bridge]
Run run run, come back for my glory
Bring her back to me
Run run run, the crown of our pharaoh
The throne of our queen is empty
[Verse 1]
And we'll run to the future, shining like diamonds
In a rocky world, rocky-rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to rhythm on the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids, tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids, voices fill up the halls
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
The jewel of Africa
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious?
How could you run off on me? How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson and his full head of hair
Found my black queen Cleopatra, bad dreams, Cleopatra
[Outro]
Remove her, send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more she lives no more serpent in her room
No more he has killed Cleopatra

[Interlude]
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now, let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels, catch her
She's headed to the pyramid
[Hook]
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
[Verse 1]
Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne,
 
let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite
 
twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank but it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
 
that keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid, keep a nigga bills paid
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that nigga but I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it,
 
ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more
[Hook]
[John Mayer guitar solo]

[Verse 1]
Babe, just say you miss me, is it that hard?
Too long since I've heard about our love
Am I in this by myself? Hey yeah
With rose colored lenses on my
 
store bought frames
To see something other than these blues and grays
I need something different, hey yeah, yeah, yeah
Cause you ain't feeling the same
[Hook]
Who knows, maybe I'm crazy, that's one big maybe
But even a fool knows when it's gold, gold, gold
I know pyrite from 24 karat, yeah
Cubic's from genuine diamond, yeah
A call from the woman who loves you and hello from a friend
I know when it's real, I know how to tell
I know the difference between what you say and how you feel
Oh, oh I know when it's real
[Verse 2]
Oh, I can tell the difference every time that you call
But I don’t need a drink I need some time in my car
Time to drive and think, time to park and cry
You shoulda known you were beautiful
You shoulda known what I saw in you, yeah
Please forgive me for feeling like it’s all your fault
A heavy heart can’t carry blame for the loss
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
You might not notice but I’m a man with pride
And this hurts me baby deep down, deep down
I can’t let go of this, gotta know I tried
It’s pathetic baby don’t lie, don’t lie
I’m a candle, you’re the sun
And you’re burning baby, you're burning baby
Burning up, burning up
Burning up, burning up, burning up, yeah
[Outro]
Pyrite from 24 karat yeah
Cubic’s from genuine diamond yeah
A call from the woman who loves you

don’t worry you won’t fail and have to move back to new orleans either.
 you are gonna get your heartbroken though. twice. if it helps, the first one is gonna be worse than the second. contrary to how it feels, it won’t kill you. 
in fact it’s gonna help you write an album.
 
yea, you finally finished an album. people like it man.
 you’re actually gonna write and record hundreds of songs. they won’t all be good and most ppl won’t think you’re talented at first, but you’re going to master your gifts. you’re going to become a lot stronger and wiser
..even a little taller.
 be patient. i mean, you kind of have no choice. and be good to people. 
i don’t wanna spoil too much for you, but.. you’re on a plane right now to the east coast to work with kanye west & jay-z.

So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby
Did you know ?
[Hook]
News said that the sky is fallin'
The globe is warmin'
My country's warin'
The leaders a liar
Time is runnin'
Lower and lower babe lower babe

But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end
End baby, quickly
Told me I don't even know your name
I said well then we mine as well make ours the same
What you think baby.
 
(No time)
Vegas might as well be light years away
So we better lay under the stars
Before they crashin' down
Cause I heard [Hook]
That's right baby kiss me like the world is wicked
Like the Earth is shakin'
You got it baby
That's right love me
Feel me like our time is sprinting faster
Running out on us

Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end

[Hook: Frank Ocean] x3
Reach for the stars go and reach for 'em baby
Do it up,do it up live it baby
[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Reach for the stars, go-stars go-stars go-stars go
Stars
[Verse 1: Rockie Fresh]
Everyday we turn up party like the weekend
Come and take a picture in here
Money we'll be seeing
Er'day we turn up
Money we'll be seeing
Money,money we'll be seeing
Money,money we'll be seeing
If you love life put a hand up
Know some times you may break down
All in all and everything is cool
When you make moves and you paint towns
Have good drinks with good friends
When the city's borin' you take trips
They'll go with you to the end and back
And then catch you if you may slip
And then help you get back up
Reach for the stars and find your peak
Many nights of that great work
All I got was some bad sleep
But for all the nights that I stayed up
These the moments we prayed of
The ones that thought we wouldn't make it
Finally get to see what we made of
We paid up
[Hook] x4

I heard my teacher say that I’d be better off
If I just took what I’ve been given
They said I never know what to do
Unless I’m told
I feel underestimated, So unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future
[Hook]
But let’s take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don’t talk me out of it
Don’t talk me out of it
It’s my life, Don’t talk me out of my life
It’s my life
I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob’s desk
But she never liked me
She said I’m gon’ fail, no matter what I give
She said ’cause my skin wasn’t light enough
Tuition wasn’t high enough
I couldn’t understand just what I did
So underestimated, You left me unaccounted for
Now you want to call me to your office right after school and show me your version of my future
[
Hook
]
Just tell me how
You’re much better than me now
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, Look at me, Look at me, Look at me
I’m still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, Look me in my eyes
[Hook]

(verse 1)
Ever since you came into my life I been moving closer to
Trynna build a vault around the both of us
When you're gone baby I ain't cool
No I ain't cool no, I can't move
And I don't know what the hell is happening to us
But I don't wanna know because it feels like something that I want
And baby I ain't never fell in love but if this is what they talk about then I don't ever wanna get out
They say it"s infatuation. I say I don't care what you name it
(Chorus)
Baby I'm loosing my air I can't breathe love. and I feel like I'm blind I can't see it love
And as sweet as it is I can't taste it
, 
but I know its real love, real (real) love
As the sky is blue, as the moon and the air change colors
Real, I'm in love with you for real, for real
(verse 2)
No I don't care who wants to question us or break us up
Cuz i'd lose a thousand friends for what I got wit you
Right here baby I'm all good, yupp, I'm all good ah. I'm all good oh
And I don't want nothing but your heart and trust
Every little tender touch
And I know love ain't only made for us but I feel like we own it
Feel like we own it
And I already know what they say, they swear that we will never make it
But if I lost you today it'd be real just the same
(Chorus)
(Bridge)
Oh I know it all can't be just a figment of imagination. a dream that won't come true. I know it all can't be just and illusion. I know what you're doing to me
(Chorus)

[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
 x2
Uhm, I said, the party isn't over
We could still dance, but I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with me
The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator]
Yeah, uhm
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting
[Interlude: Kids]
We're making smores by the campfire
Camp flog gnaw, golf wang summer
[Verse 2: Laetitia Sadier]
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart
[Interlude: Tyler, the Creator]
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, hehe
Who ate all the fuckin chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really
[Hook: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space,
 
the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your head lights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash
[Verse 1: Tyler The Creator & (Frank Ocean)]
Pop some Tame Impala,
 
your man got a lame Impala
(It'll get dark outside soon)
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
(Where the street lights trail, Oooooooo)
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
(Ride for)
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Mmmm it’ll get dark outside, soon (My baby, ride for me)
Where the street lights trail (My baby, ride for me)
You ain’t gotta lie to kick it darling
It’s cool we’re moving slow
[Bridge: Tyler The Creator]
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer
[Outro]
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans too

i was raised christian.
 only had a few friends from different religions growing up. these days i’ve got family from agnostic to islam. 
my grandmother was pentecostal evangelical.
 
she brought much of that fire and brimstone back to her household.
 
my uncle tony said the other kids teased him and his siblings, called them “holyrollers”.
 so as you may or may not expect, my mother was, and still is, less than imposing when it comes to a particular system of belief. i was a practicing catholic for a short time. me and moms started going to separate churches when i was like 13. i never sang or played in the church though, unfortunately. i remember being kind of intimidated by the idea of it actually. 
church was the hood julliard to me.
 
all the coldest musicians came out of there.
 
the lady in the video…summa cum laude.

[Hook]
Rewind that
Can't get you out of my mind, I want it all the time
You gotta come and rewind that
Baby girls a 10, come out and do it again
Let me see you rewind that
Girl you know I love the sound of when we putting it down
You make me wanna rewind that
Shawty put the thing on me and I'm waiting to see if you won't rewind that
[Verse 1]
(Stop) Shawty what your name is?
Never mind cause you know that I'm famous
Got chicks from LA to Romanians
Baby I want you (We could take it slow)
Wine you and dine you
Every penny cause I know you're a diamond
Know what you want
And you know how to get it
Look at those lips let me know that you with it tonight
[Bridge]
Fast foward back to my spot
Top of the table telling me don't stop
Touching that place that'll keep you hot tonight
Got it going nonstop tonight and (now pause)
Baby what you tryna do?
You know the things all up to you
We can talk all night
Or you can leave your crew and do what we came to do tonight
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
(Stop) We ain't gotta stop tonight we can do it anyway you like
I can pull on your hair, I can even bite
Or take it way down low tonight (We can take it slow)
We can grind on the floor
Push those hips against me, I know
When I hit it real good and
You're girls ain't got to know
But you know, so baby girl lets go
[Bridge]
[Hook x2]

[Intro]
We in the studio
I said, we in the studio
Is this mic on? Check, check
[Verse 1]
I'm thankful for my position I was given in life
Cause I know some people living who ain't living this life
Read about starved children who ain't eating this right
Drug lords declare war, selling cheaper the price
Stunting dummy drug money, yeah them sneakers is nice
Get your swag from the blacks selling bags of the white
Niggas can't get a job, so we self-employed
If the coppers come a-knocking, we gon' help that boy
Bail money, welcome back home out of jail money
White girl pale money, sunny when we sell money
See seashell money, we sell money
Rain, hail money, heaven what the hell money
Dusty paper, stale money,
 
I thought they restricted it
Did for most people but we out here getting it
[Hook]
Bunch of hands under her dress, we get the feeling that she's faded
And she's willing screaming
 
Wolf Gang, whip me off, get me off
The sex, it turns to children, then the children turn to villains
Villain wolves screaming kill them all, fuck 'em all
And that go for anybody that come around here, that ain't from around here
Ho, you too, you ain't special, Wolf Gang kill them all, fuck 'em all
[Verse 2]
She handles herself with class
She got a nice ass but she can't run no games on me
She claim to like the stores and the clothes
Jeans bleached with the holes, but she can't get my bank homie
Too smart is no good, if she smart for no good
It's so good, she can't flaunt her thing on me
She can be full of swag, drive a Jag
Poppin' tags on the Ave but she can't get her cake from me
That sounded like the hook I threw at her and the swag I reeled her in
Said she came to feel me in, when she really came to fill me in
Like baby what's the deal with it? Seem to be attracted
By the fiancee and finance that no wifey concealin' it
Dealin' with life's shuffle, then fold
Dippin' with the duffles I hold, if we are a couple, let's go
To the place where we lead in the life to some sleep
Bring the pipe, blow the weed
, punchlines to be received
[Hook]

"Three minutes forty five seconds and counting, we are still a go at this time"
[Verse 1]
Listening to Star Trak's star tracks
On the track to stars
 
and back
Only after we get to the end
Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl
[Climb]
But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Ohh up here, up here
[Hook)
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh
"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"
[Verse 2]
The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, Big bang, look at what we made beautiful
[Climb]
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse oohh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no
[Hook X2]
"20 seconds and counting
T minus 15 seconds, guidance is internal
12, 11, 10, 9, ignition sequence start
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, all engines running
Lift off, we have a lift off, lift off"

[Verse 1: Jhene Aiko]
Yeah, yeah yeah
Alright, yeah, yeah
Okay you back to talking that shit again
Questioning me about where I been
I don't even know why you here
You ain't even po' be here
I put it all on the line
I be lovin you every night
You the one I come home to right?
Right? Right??
Man I wish I had some weed up in my system
Cuz I'm bout two seconds away from just flippin out
How could you say that I did it when I didn't
Think it's bout time that we end this now
I don't need your trust
I don't need this shit, yeah
I have had enough, I think you should just
[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
Run away
Get away, find a new love
Run away, ooooohhh ohh
Oh ooh ohh
[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Now you're thinkin' 'bout it
Girl you're thinkin' 'bout it
What we got here
How we fuckin' got here
They recognize
They just recognize
I'm in a life without a home so this recognitions not enough
I don't care bout nobody else
Cause I've been on these streets way too long
Baby I've been on this too long
Cause getting faded too long
Got me on this rolling stone
So I take another hit
Kill another serotone
With a hand full of beans
And a chest full of weed
Got me singing bout a bitch
While I'm blowing out my steam
Yeah I know I got my issues
Why you think I fuckin' flow?
And I'mma keep on smoking 'til I can't hit another note
Ohhhh but until then
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
She singing bitch I'm paid,
 
that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the pride, in it for the ride, yeah
[Hook]

Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don’t it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don’t it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that’s you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies
(Bridge)
Myself ain’t never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he’s searching for
(Chorus)
No wonder why there’s no mirrors on these walls no more
You can’t tell me why you’re so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
Just turn the lamp down
Don’t talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can’t decide, I can’t decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies
(Bridge)
Myself ain’t never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he’s searching for
(Chorus)
No wonder why there’s no mirrors on these walls no more
You can’t tell me why you’re so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you’re so unfair to all of the beautiful ones
(Chorus)
No wonder why there’s no mirrors on these walls no more
You can’t tell me why you’re so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Golden rubbers in these denim pockets
On my waist, there's a black Glock
New girl moved on the block
She been plottin' on my brown cock
Last night I slept over hers, during sex, I overheard
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen you sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja with the blade and the mask
Got them gold ninja stars and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
[Hook: Frank Ocean]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window, he's at your window
[Verse 2: Tyler]
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'mma down to Earth nigga, with intentions, that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one
But I give two for us cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top I'm writing songs about we
We as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones,
 
drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time
[Hook]
[Bridge: Tyler]
One, two, you're the girl that I want
Three, four, five, six, seven, shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it, you're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it but that's because I'm in love with you, cunt
[Bridge 2: Tyler]
I just wanna talk, and conversate
Cause I usually just stalk you and masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place, cunt
[Hook] + [Bridge]

[Lights Out]
The name's lights out, 
and my flow too
I provoke you, them pussy juices flow through
A pair of lips that I would kiss if I could hold you
But I ain't ever satisfied, and yourgasm is old news
Sometimes I wonder if it happened
But still I savor every single word of your reaction
I tried tell you, but I just had to show you
You came around a couple times and loved it, but it's old news
You didn't wanna fuck, you made it very clear
I didn't finish up, you couldn't fuckin' get me there
You could've had the dick, decided you would rather split
And now you're getting pounded by some faggot, I'm astounded, bitch
What's that? oh you don't like the sound of this?
You know you still remember my tender fingers around your clit
And don't pretend you never doubted it
I'm here to tell the truth, reality checks and balances
[Frank Ocean]
Blinds wide open so he can see you in the dark when you're sleeping
Naked body fresh out the shower, you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom, you're sleeping alone in bed
Check your window, he's at your window
[Lights Out]
Now I would never advocate taking advantage of a woman
I'd like to have my fucking way with you, but I couldn't
It doesn't mean I'm gonna show up at your window
With a mask that's colored green, and while you sleep, I'm in your bedroom
Your subtle curves disturb my thoughts, I'm going mental
And my brakes could never handle all the trouble that I'm into
I'm not a stalker, it's just that I'm in lust
And maybe once upon time it was love, now I just wanna fuck
I think I've seemed to misremember what your name is
Or maybe I don't give a fuck, cause honestly, I'm faded
Come to think of it, I don't know where my brain is
Cause my dick is in your pussy, but you're passed out on the pavement
I'm really sorry, I never meant to hurt you
But understand you've done enough to me to serve my purpose
It's just a fantasy, I'd never fucking rape you
But in my dreams are places I would never fucking take you
[Hook, Frank Ocean]
[Lights Out]
At the door, on the floor, in the closet or the basement
Hiding in the shadows I'm just waiting ever patient
When everyone's asleep i'll slowly creep beside your bed
And spill my guts in cursive for the purpose of my head
Because you're my fucking counselor
And if you're not the queen, then what the fuck'd I fucking crown you for?
You had never come around before, we never fucked
And I just wish I had a chance to mount you more
It seems like all we did is kissing
And you had hole inside you, I could tell something was missing
But you were having none of it
Not from me, I know that you were sitting on another dick
But that's just how a bitch is
I wonder if my fingers were covered up in his liquids
I'll never understand it though
I think it's time I let you speak, where did all my manners go?
But I could never shut up
Every time I spoke it just became another fuck up
Even now I probably should shut my mouth
But I need to get your attention, I need to just let it out
Having pipe dreams of benjamins and fucking trophies
Statuettes of astronauts and plaques of records, golden
I mean you kinda like that guy that's in the US open
Not the one that won cause I'm the one that left the records broken
You didn't used to come in second
Before you fucked me over you were royalty I reckon
That you never gave a fuck, it's clear that you didn't fuck me
I guess if I had to guess I would say that you didn't love me
Good vibes from bad girls with book smarts
I'm attracted to these women cause they look smart
But they always let me down
The weather's gotten colder ever since you came around

Excuses are the tools of the weak and incompetent.
 
They build bridges to nowhere and tunnels to nothingness….
 
Those who excel in them seldom do in anything else,
 
therefore there are no excuses.

My best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy crushing, puppy loving, you know
Ah
You are my high school wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart 2,000 miles away
[Bridge]
And now I sit at home, answer the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone
[Hook]
Hearing the same songs in my car
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello
Hello
Hello
She won't
Say hello
Hello
Hello
Nah nah she won't
My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, I really wanna
Oh
We did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
I'm praying (Aw) you come back again
I'm praying (Aw) you come back again
[Bridge]
And now I sit at home, answer the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone
[Hook]
Hearing the same songs in my car
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to 
her
, pass to her
My baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her
[Bridge]
And now I sit at home, answer the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone
[Hook]
Hearing the same songs in my car
Hung up cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello
Hello
Hello
She won't
Say hello
Hello
Hello
Nah nah she won't

(We're was spendin' too much time alone)
Spendin' too much time alone
(And I just ran outta Trojans)
Horses gallop to her throne
(We're behaving like teenagers)
We're behaving like teenagers
(Making less than minimum wage)
Still inside our parents' homes
(No I don't live in Denver)
No I don't live in Denver
(I grew up in Sierra Leone)
And her pink skies will keep me warm
Sierra Leone
Sierra Leone
Tid bits of intuition that I be gettin' abandon mission (Sierra Leone)
Abandon mission, you must be kiddin', this shit feelin' different
Shit feelin' too good to me
Glistening, shimmerin' underneath the sunlight, the sunlight (Sierra Leone)
And a new day will bring about the dawn
And a new day will bring another crying babe into the world
 
(girl now)
Our daughter's reaching for your nipple cause it's time for her to eat
Tonight I'll lay her in the cradle if it's time for go to sleep
I'll sing a Lennon lullaby, she can have a pretty dream
Baby girl if you knew what I know, knew what I know
Na, na na, na na, na...
Na, na na, na na, na...

[Frank Ocean]
It's simple, so simple
These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to
 love me
[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard
, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love
My mother said "Son don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard. It's simple"
These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me
[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love
I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one (cause I really can't)
Move on(I gotta) get on (I gotta) get on with our hearts
With ours lives cause they're simply to short
Without love
[Hook]
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

[Hook: Tyler, The Creator]
Me and Slater just hit a curb
Bunny hop,
 
zoning out, listening to N.E.R.D
Made a couple thousands turds spitting written verbs
Shit, now I kick it in the 'burbs
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Me? I'm from the slums,
 
niggas who push a ton
Ton of drums,
 
with foul flow dirty mouth like kissing bums
Mama done made her one Uh, a witty son
With no respect for women
 
so show me your titties hun
"You eighteen?", Me? I'm twenty something
Okay I'm twenty, but I'm soon to be twenty-one
I wild out at shows, break shit -- it should be fun
Venues are like pussy with me, "Should he come?"
I'mma wax that like the Chapstick in my backpack, for my black lips
Then dip to Europe and come back with a stack of cheese
A stack of cheese for these rats, Mac and Cheese
New Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics, (how's your dick?), "Shit, how's your knees?"
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
Came up with ''Rella'',
 
ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs
Golf Wang, that's the team to be, "Aye!", getting TU, OF, indeed
We was missing Sweatshirt like, where's the hooded sleeve
Okay, nevermind, we found him
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Guess I win, checks started cashing in
I stop rapping and start asking where my fucking passion is
Probably where that faggot went (who?), Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns
I ain't ask for this, I did it out of boredom
Thought the roach was cool, he died and pushed me into stardom
Now Ye's PJ
 
sipping leche,
 
Chips Ahoy! boy,
 
listening to Cowboy
Aye boy,
 
land in Melbourne and skate to Fitzroy (Aye!)
AUS was AWES,
 
I enjoyed, boy, y'all niggas played as a tot's toy
Have a good day as I annoy, oi
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Tyler, The Creator]
Cameras with panorama views
My shoes have seen more vans than Mexicanas with crackers in Alabama
G-O-to the-L-F, this O-F, I opened up a store so I don't stress
But nigga I, (what?), 
mosh in gardens, jazz punk shit
Playing chords, making up shit, pardon my Dolly Parton's
And I keep sharting,
 
hoodies with rectangles and different colors
Niggers think I started kindergarten
[Interlude: Frank Ocean & Tyler]
My bitch is on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
Hair blowing in the wind
My bitch is on my handle bars
(I just wanna ride my bike)
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
My bitch is on my handle bars
Hair blowing in the wind
Her freckles look like candy bars
My cool summer never ends
Slater, Slater, Slater, Slater
[Frank Ocean]
Oh my God, seriously? Mister cool guy. You're talking to a fucking bike, loser. (Ha ha)
 
Oh... Fuck

I'm afraid to say it
Don't wan't you to think I'm playing
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I’m standing naked,in a crowd
And I'm sorry I know that I’m wrong yeah I’m wrong
If I could I'd go back I’m exposed give me back my clothes cause I just can’t take it
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy
I guess its cool naked with you already seen me
Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I’m wrong, comfortable
You don’t mind them flaws, you’ve already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable
You keep on forgiving
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
When you stay it makes me forget that I’m down, now it’s all so simple
Till the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Feels so good letting go I’m exposed, you can have my clothes cause I’m not afraid
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it’s cool naked with you already seen me
(Chorus)
It don’t matter it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before
It don’t matter it don’t matter , you’ve seen it all before
It don’t matter it don’t matter no, you’ve seen it all before
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable
(Chorus)

Ohh noooo
Ooooh yeah
Ooooh yeah
So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butter-flies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it, made you, smile
Cause I got a little style goin
You laugh in my face but, I didn't care
Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date
, 
now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt
I know it's true if, they're, just like you
So fresh
So fresh
So fresh
So fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, ooh
So fresh
So fresh
So fresh
So fresh
You're like my favorite
I swear you could play forever...

[Intro]
When I was younger I used to wonder like
[Verse 1]
If I was singing songs, just to sing the songs
Or if was singing cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try to bus with me
But I would say girl don't be dumb, I'm riding shotgun
We could go to my house after school after school, after school
Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late, off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'mma give you chills harmonizing to
 
Otis
, 
Isley
, 
Marvin
[Hook]
And everytime somebody asked me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair no fair that's cheating
I say shit, oh well, oh well
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say yeah
They say no fair, no fair that's cheating
I say boy don't judge cause hell if you were me
You'd be singin' to her, like lah dah dah dah
[Verse 2]
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past, the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holla at me
Put her purse down and try to battle rap me
She don't do that no more, no more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
, 
she stay blasting
 
Trey and his songs
All damn day long, it's like she never heard of me
[Hook]
Now everytime somebody asks me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say naw
 
they say okay I don't believe it
I say nope I swear I never do it
And everytime a nigga asks me
If I sing songs to get at women, I say naw
They say who do you think you're kidding
I know you, you stole my girlfriend
Now see I just don't play fair, but it's fair enough
Cause yo girl broke my heart in half
Now I'm singing 'bout heartbreak
And now I'm singing 'bout love lost

[Cassettes changing]

[Verse 1:]
I'm standing by your locker
In the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
The drawing in my binder
Every picture I put a halo on your head
[Hook]
I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my mommma' like so much
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still still waiting there
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still
[Verse 2:]
Saturdays am at the snow cone spot
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinking, and candy maybe
I'm boiling on a place mat on the table
Next to me, I wish you could taste it
Cause it's surely melting
[Hook]
[Bridge:]
While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here, Seconds forward
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Oh no, matter what i'll be here
[HookX2]

*Laughter*
They look like twins
That was embarrassing
*turns on the TV*
*PlayStation start-up screen*
*Video game sound ambience*

[Intro]
La da da da daaaa (Okay...cause it never felt like that)
La da da da daaaa ( uh uh... its like)
Ohh (Every touch.. every kiss...static baby)
Ohhh (hahah..yeah)
[Verse 1]
Baby, I don't really know which way to go
It's like your energy keep callin'
I, Im bout to lose my self composure
Even sex has got me braggin'
And You, you look so good
I wish you would give me what Im looking for
Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front. I'll be there 1 on 1
And you're the one I want girl
[Hook]
You're like static
It's way beyond me girl, its like magic
Got me feenin' for your touch like an addict. Gotta have it
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
You're like static
Girl this thing feels so good, so I wish you would
[Verse 2]
And I ain't even playing girl
Theres so much truth in what Im saying girl
You got my head all in it. Like a game of chess baby check me
This ain't no first date. Don't hesitate. No ??
And Ima take it nice and slow, yeah. Take your body where it needs to go
Give me what Im looking for. Touch is so electric
Got my heart racing. Pulse is off the charts
And I can't even front, I need the 1 on 1
You're the one I want, girl
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Doin' 85 on a freeway
. 
Switchin' lanes in my "range"
GPS is saying next exit
. 
I got your text message
I'm on my way to you. Here's what were gonna do
And girl I'll take it to you. Fit closer, don't stop
Don't mess up the flow. Don't be scared
Touch right there. Make it personal
I don't really know what it is that you do
Its like a force, im stuck onto you like static
[Hook]

My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
My honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he’s gone
Cause when we’re together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part
(Bridge 1)
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out
(Chorus)
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Sugar bunches of oats
My buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love
And then it’s like
Whenever it’s just me and you
You know I don’t wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons
And when to press them, baby, dammit
(Bridge 1)
Oh, oh you’re calling me crazy
Saying I’m always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You’re packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I’m screaming get out
(Chorus)
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
(Bridge 2)
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
You gotta leave
Boy you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It’s just gon’ happen
I don’t understand it
My heart’s sane
But my mind’s going crazy
(Chorus)
But don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
I say that you should leave but don’t go
Don’t go, don’t go, don’t go
Don’t go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
(Bridge 2)
I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave
Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay

mind is pretty blank right now.
 
i’m sitting in my kitchen listening to age of consent by new order. i like this song..
 
i fuck with that gwen stefani song ‘cool’ too, i never knew 3000 played keyboards on it-
 
sounds like some teen coming of age movie.
 
i used my birthday week pass to stay in my apartment for too long.. sit still and catch up on some information.
 
i saw that movie ‘glengarry glen ross’
 
and ‘bottle rocket’,
 
‘pi’,
 
‘blackfish’ (sea world is the devil),
 
‘this is the end’ (hahaha),
 
‘the purge’(smh),
 
some funny horror movie i forgot the name of ‘…’ .
 
my homie in aussie suggested that i read ‘mr. norris changes trains’.. the writing was really nice.
 
i read ‘the new jim crow’ it made me not fuck with humans for an hour.
 
oh and ‘diffficult men’ which talked about great tv ..dexter, the wire, the sopranos, breaking bad and whatnot.
 i didn’t watch any news or read it …figured all that shit was gonna happen either way. 
i’m back to work these days.

[Verse 1]
When we were kids, we handpainted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious, then
I'm still kicking, I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
, 
all the world is at its end
Just in case, an atom bomb, comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear I've loved
I've loved the good times here, I've loved our good times here
[Verse 2]
Say hello, then say farewell to the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we? Any moment this could go
Cry, cry, cry, even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear, that I have loved
I have loved the good times here, and I will miss our good times
[Sample: Coldplay's "Strawberry Swing"]
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
Could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be gray
Without you I just slide away
The sky could be blue, I don’t mind
Without you it’s a waste of time
[Outro]
Spaceships are lifting off of a dying world
And millions are left behind while the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I, only you, goodbye, goodbye
(Sound of alarm clock abruptly interrupting song.)

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
I told her that I missed her put her on a plane
Goyard luggage

And if she left a nigga I wouldn't be the same

High profile, sweet, bring them hoes to the tele Nah
Bitches fuck your shit up words from DMX in Belly behind you back
Planning your downfall, I thought that was your relly-
Relative, skin of ribs and eat healthy
I belch a bitch and leave her tits on a shelving
I felt a bitch, she let me in, welcoming
Fuck duct tape nigga, I like Velcro-ing

I make you shit all in your pants and your pamper, bitch
Niggas quick to sing a hook and make a dance up quick
For you it’s never or never,

Snow so white, moon so bright
They’re on a playground making canines fight
Ain’t no place for my kids to go
[Verse 2]
The wolves are rowdy and in the parking lot
I don’t mean basketball when I say that they be balling in the park a lot
It’s like the big bad wolf duplicated
If they getting shitted on by critics, it’s cool, they super rated
Life on the huge and playlist, daily’s the fucking basis
Accounting for all the hatred, get off the children’s sacred
I’m international, actual but in fact I go from
The US to the UK to Amsterdam in like two days
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Earl Sweatshirt]
I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into, and I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you, I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
, and this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the Logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded I stumble
To where she park when she visit
, 
I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
She, she seems that
[Hook: Earl Sweatshirt]
All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like
[Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
I’m coming back I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat,
 
left you at terminal three
I’ll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
And you parade my homecoming, don’t cry
You know I can’t live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I’d be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please
Palm, no marijuana, trees
Your hickies on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I’m playing surfboarder,
 
put whisky in that salt water
I emptied every canteen just to wear that straight edge varsity you think’s cool
They thought me soft in High School, thank God I’m jagged
Forgot you don’t like it rough, I mean he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean how anal am I gon' be when I’m aiming my gun
And why’s his mug all bloody, that was a three on one?
Standing ovation at Staples I got my Grammy’s and gold
Polka dots on my Brit,
 
I’m not supposed to be stunting
It’s all melodic this song, I catch this vibe in my sleep
But I’m just jet-lagged is all, and restless
[Hook: Frank Ocean]
All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you’s a little different I don’t like you a lot
I mean…fuck
[Outro]
I don’t know what we’re about
What good is West Coast weather if you’re bi-polar?
If I'mma need this sweater, I’d rather be where it’s cold
Where it snows,
 
I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, know they’re coming in droves
You’ll only miss when it goes
(Yeah, I think that’s it)
When it goes…..

[Verse 1]
This ain't no Glee shit
Imma stay rapping raps that are halfway decent
If you believe what the average man has to say
Nah fuck that (x3)
I got lines for days, check the bar chart
Spread no sheet, I excel
Connolly comma Billy, being Brave
Bare bones instrumentals
Not dissing, 
get fools took like
 
Pippin
Lacking direction like the musical you'll end up settling down
Bound 2 falling, not in love
Instead talking sullen
Started from the bottom, now you where?
Still there
Not gonna do you on a song
I'll get you off track, red herring
Inferiority complex, therein lies the problem
Air headed like an heiress, it's all for show (x2)
Nooooo
I'm saying no names like the Scottish play
Try to flee and I'll body you like the bubonic plague
In the Middle Ages, wasting away
Quickly outdated like old beta tapes
I'm the Replacement, Keanu Reeves
This verse is pitch perfect, got tricks up my staves
[Outro]
Way over heads now

[Produced by: 
, Beyoncé Knowles and BOOTS]
[Verse 1]
When the palm of my two hands hold each other
That feels different
From when your hands are in mine
That's just the way it is
And when my voice is screaming out to my own ears
That feels different from when I hear yours
Now that's just the way it is
And when I'm standing in this mirror after all these years
What I'm viewing is a little different
From what your eyes show you
I guess I didn't see myself before you
Moving forward
[Bridge: Beyonce & Frank Ocean]
(Superpower) A subtle power
(Superpower) A tough love
(Superpower) Like a shark
(Superpower) Like a bear, a tough love
[Hook: Beyonce & 
 Ocean]
And I thought the world would move on
I thought the world would revolve
Without us, without us, without us
But nothing I know could slow us down
Couldn't slow us down
I thought I could live without you
Cause nothing I know can break us down
They can't break us down
[Verse 2]
And just like you I can be scared
Just like you I hope I'm spared
But it's tough love
I know you feel it in the air
Even the babies know it's there: tough love (superpower)
The laws of the world tell us what goes 
And what falls, it's a superpower (superpower)
The laws of the world never stopped us once
Cause together we got plenty superpower
[Bridge 2: Beyonce & (Frank Ocean)]
(Superpower) A subtle power
(Superpower) A tough love
(Superpower) Like a shark
(Superpower) Too much to bear
[Hook]
[Outro]
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down
Yes, we can
Couldn't break us down
They couldn't break us down

[Refrain]
Too many bottles of this wine we can’t pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain’t around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy’s Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Start my day up on the roof
There’s nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We’ll both be high, the help don’t stare
They just walk by, they must don’t care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
[Refrain]
[Bridge]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Oh, real love
[Verse 2: Earl Sweatshirt]
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the xany-gnashing
Caddy-smashing,
 
bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts
Don’t believe us
Treat us like we can’t erupt, yup
[Alternate Verse 2: Frank Ocean]
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all they clothes revealing they tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I’ll jump, I never do
But when I’m drunk I act a fool
Talking bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I’m on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don’t end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
[Refrain]
[Outro]
Real love, ain't that something rare
I’m searching for a real love, talking bout real love
Real love yeah
Real love
I’m searching for a real love
Talking bout a real love

[Verse 1]
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Livin' in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life
[Bridge 1]
The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie
[Hook]
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The starshine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life
[Verse 2]
The best song wasn't the single, but you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keepin' it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keepin' it surreal, not sugar-free, 
my tv ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life
[Bridge 2]
A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
And the water, is exactly what I wanted
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is gettin' trippier every day
The neighborhood is goin' ape shit crazy
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
And everytime the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
And I've got this black suit on, roaming around like
I'm ready for a funeral,
 
five more miles 'til the road runs out
[Hook]
I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'mma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
 
and swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
 
and swim good, and swim good, good
[Verse 2]
Got some pretty good beats on this 808 CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated
I woulda put tints on my windows but what's the difference
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze, ever since I lost my baby
I've had this black suit on, roaming around
Like I'm ready for a funeral,
 
one more mile 'til the road runs out
[Hook]
[Bridge]
I'm going off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm going off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (Broke my heart)
No flares (Broke my heart)
No vest (Drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washing me out
[Hook]
[Outro]
Don't die

I built us a little gingerbread house

You ate through em, you ate through em
You ate through em, yeah, yeah
Frank Ocean
- Chorus
Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, 
I can't blame you
When we first met, 
I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweaty, you tell me now that your craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Frank Ocean

We took chartered flights
All around to taste those malls that
You like most, said the jefe food taste like pink raspberry

Give me my power (x4), I built this city
I got plenty concrete, plenty steel
Please give me my trees. Give 'em back
Give me tourists. Give me traffic
Give me noise. Just give it back..
Could you bring back all my police? Give me order
Turn back on my lights. Give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone
[Hook]
I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
; 
gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more
Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates. Give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order?
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
[Hook]
And with the streets all dark, The buildings look lost
I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, All power over, power over me
Give it to me. Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

We used to be sky high
We used to be major

[Hook]
There will be tears, I've no doubt
There may be smiles but a few
And when those tears have run out
You will be numb and blue
[Bridge]
I can't be there with you, but I can dream
I still dream dream dream, I still dream
[Verse]
My grandaddy was a player, pretty boy in a pair of gators
See I met him later on, think it was 1991
The only dad I'd ever know, but pretty soon he'd be gone too
Hide my face, hide my face, can't let 'em see me crying
Cause these boys didn't have no fathers neither
And they weren't crying,
 
my friend said it wasn't so bad
You can't miss what you ain't had,
 
well I can, I'm sad and
[Hook]
[Outro]
I can't be there, that's all you had to say to me was
You couldn't be there, why couldn't you say to me
You won't be there, you coulda warned me
You wouldn't be here right here, you wouldn't be here for me, no

[Verse 1: Einstein]
To be honest, I don't really know how to start this
I never been big for showing emotions, but I'm broken hearted
Wow, that's crazy, it's hard to accept the fact
That after, everything we been through, its still too hard to forget the past
But, that's life, that's how the story unfolds
We doing our thang, two different ways, living life and growing old
We always said we were meant to be, and other people begged to differ
But none of that mattered to me, as long as you were still in the picture
So I, decided to frame it, but recently I been getting famous
I'm hitting the road, doing different shows, while you stuck at home, just waiting
Well, that ain't fair to you, but it ain't fair to me, what you decided to do
Going behind my back, but I ain't gonna go and put you blast, so I'mma leave it at that, cause I'm still too nice of a dude
That's cool, do you, I'mma do me
20 months, of love and trust, ha, could of fooled me
Jokes on me, we wasted time together
But you spend a lot of time getting wasted, so I guess wasted time was pleasure
Ha, it's whatever, might as well leave it at that
You changed so much there ain't no way we'll ever be able to turn back
But, it's hard to even think about being without you
Oh! Remember you wanted your song, here, I wrote this when I was thinking about you
[Bridge: Frank Ocean]
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you (You know, know, know)
I’ve been thinkin’ ’bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
[Hook: Frank Ocean]
Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever (Oooh, oooh)
Or do you not think so far ahead?
‘Cause I been thinking ’bout forever
[Einstein] Cause I've been thinking about forever
(Oooh, oooh)
[Einstein] You and me happily back together, together
[Hook Repeat]
[Einstein] Cause I've been thinking about forever
You and me happily back together, together forever
[Einstein] Cause I've been thinking about forever
You and me happily back together always and forever, and ever
Always and forever, and ever

Right hand to God
Left hand holding the jewels
And I'm swearing up and down
I'm cursing out the moon
Tide stole my youth
These creases in my brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole my eyes (Beachlife)
The sun's burning black and blue (On my green eyes)
Too cold this side of June
It ain't natural
Right hand in yours
Left hand holding the juice
When that jungle flower blooms
Leave it in the ground
Don't try to cut it out
The creases in your brow ain't tan lines
Saltwater swole your eyes (Beachlife)
The sun burned black and blue (On your green eyes)
Too cold this side of June
It ain't natural
I'll rebel, I'll rebel
But it ain't natural
I take care, I take care
It's just not growing well
I'm no match for you
It's not hard to 
tell
This isn't going well
But we're under the palm trees
Thinking heaven must be
Somewhere under these palm trees
With all the hell we're raising
At least we had the palm trees
To shade us from the ray beams
But not even the palm trees
Could save us from the flames
Summer remains

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn’t rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don’t shed tears, girl, they bawl
[Pre-Chorus]
I’ve thinking ’bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinking ’bout you
(No, no, no)
I’ve been thinking ’bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?
[Chorus]
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinking about forever (Ooh, ooh)
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinking about forever (Ooh, ooh)
[Jaden Smith Rap]
I been thinking ’bout you and you know I do
When I be thinking ’bout them kisses girl so are you
Man I heard some things, I don’t know it’s true
But people say you really like me and I hope that’s true
You my baby girl and I hope you know it
A boy will tell you that he loves you but a man will show it
That’s why you in my arms, just for the day
Cause let so much go by you be dancing away
But let’s just have some fun girl
As long as you’re here
Cause when you get up on that plane you’ll be gone for a year
And when you come up in my room I’ll be bawling some tears
But people say just live in the moment it’s wrong to be scared girl
Is it wrong to be scared?
Cause that’s what they say and every day that I don’t see you
You slipping away
And all my teachers in my class thinking I’m crazy
But they don’t know that I think about you daily cause I be
[Pre-Chorus]
Thinking ’bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinking ’bout you
(No, no, no)
I’ve been thinking ’bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?
[Chorus]
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinking ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinking ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
[Justin Bieber Rap]
Baby I could pick you up in the roll Royce
Anywhere you want to go it’s your choice
Every time that I’m away girl I miss your voice
And I promise that I’m nothing like them other boys
I came from the bottom now I’m at the top
Tell you I love you every day and that I’ll never stop
They say it’s true love well is love true
Yeah I think it’s love that’s why I found you
Aren’t a second that’ll go by that I don’t think you’re so fly
And I know why aren’t no guy going to treat you like I want to
Going to be the man that treat you right
Be the man to hold you tight
You know I know you right
Let’s go into the night
[Pre-Chorus]
Thinking ’bout you
(Ooh, no, no, no)
I’ve been thinking ’bout you
(No, no, no)
I’ve been thinking ’bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?
[Chorus]
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinking ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)
Do you not think so far ahead?
I been thinking ’bout forever (Ooh, ooh)

Get on my bike and ima fly through time
Until im with you.. I promise
I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And thats cost you years
[Hook]
This is has been the one of my fears
Thats has only ever caused you tears
So time machine, take me ahead till I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her - can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her, - she ain't living by herself
Lift off an goooo Oooooh Ooooooh
I tried
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our life, oh all of it
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there we're making out listening to purple rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it
[Hook]
[Bridge]
I'm on my way their
To that time in space
I wish you could see, all that I see now
I'm headed towards you, yeah
I wish that time could wait
I'm on my way home
[Hook]

Oh we’re in this together
Have a little faith
Oh you ought to know who you are
Oh we’re all children
We’re all human, we’re all breathing
We’re all needing, more than, what their giving
Can’t you feel it?
The space of what’s missing
(Bridge)
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
Cause you’ve convinced yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got
(Chorus)
But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together, we’re together
I love you
And I don’t know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone who’s going through it
(Bridge)
You look up and they tell you it’s a godless sky, a godless sky
But don’t you look down
Don’t you convince yourself
That this is all you’ve got, all you’ve got
(Chorus)
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces that high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together
I’ve searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them
(Chorus)
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces that high for love
If there’s one thing about this world I know
It’s that we’re in it, together
You’re not alone, I’m not alone
If there’s one thing about this world I know
We’re together

[Frank Ocean]
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues
[Hook]
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nuttin for me
You can't do nuttin for me - that's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal," girl I don't take it personal - no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight night, at the end of the night night
And all fuckin night night, it's gon' be tonight night, yeah
And when the last song's played yo, they're gone
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
[Frank Ocean]
You see if I was another type I'da ran away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or som'n, she said "Is it game or som'n?"
"You pullin the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"
[Hook]
[Frank Ocean]
And when the last song's played yo, they're gone
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down ohhhhhhhhh

(Verse 1)
Taking turns we're pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there’s no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can’t do this revolving door, any longer
(Bridge)
I’m motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet how do we make it right
This ain’t making sense no more
(Chorus)
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving 
truce
, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I’m waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I’m calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
(Verse 2)
Maybe it’s the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically in the beginning that’s what made us close
And now that’s the very reason
That we’re slamming doors
But we’re both adults, it’s time we get over it
(Pre-Chorus) + (Chorus)
(Bridge)
If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won’t be no fighting, 
I’ma throw the towel in
Cause I decided, I like us way better like this
(Chorus)

Verse 1:
I guess it felt a little bit better when we were still arguing about it
Cause in the words I could still hear love
Somebody still cared
And I would rather sleep on the sofa as long as you're still in our bed
At least I'm sure that you're at home and you ever left me yeah
Hook: 
You said you know my heart is good
But you'd hate me if you could
If I would allow you to you would
You could, you should but don't
Chorus: 
Try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try, try
Verse 2: 
It's breaking my heart to see you there
Sickening I hate standing at that station
It's a picture that I don't wanna frame
Tears in your eyes
Love dejects your side
[Hook]
[Hook]
Verse 3: 
You ain't gotta work too hard
Tryna break my heart
But don't try, don't try, don't try
You ain't gotta work too hard
Trying to move on ohh oh
Try to stay
Try to think
Chorus: 
Don't try to leave me
Try to stay
Giving up
Is harder baby
Don't try don't try
Don't try to leave girl
Try to stay
Try
Try, try
Just try

SELF-SERVING, ARROGANT, PRETENTIOUS, CONTROLLING, STUBBORN, INCONSISTENT, MORALLY GREY…
 
GORGEOUS, MODEST, COMPASSIONATE, GENIUS, HONEST, KIND, RELIABLE, RARE HUMAN BEING.
i’ll take the positive and not so positive adjectives about me in stride.

I’ve been meaning to write you more. different hotels every night aren’t so bad really.
 
in fact- all the moving house could inspire a photo series.. not for the gram,
 knowing me it’s probably only for whoever controls my estate in the future and enthusiastically develops all the rolls of film i forgot to. 
i’m in belgium, just 7 concerts into a tour with an ambiguous ending.
 
i’d tour for a year if it didn’t interrupt my recording
 or my 
weekend driving
. 
i really wanted to go to cairo in between europe and australia.. might let things settle some..
 
go to south africa instead and place some flowers on a gate for the president.for being epic and 94.
 i write on paper at night. my tour manager gave me a small powder blue book at the beginning of this run with gold embossed lettering on the cover that reads ‘one line a day’.. 
it’s easier than you’d think to narrow the entire cinema of your day into one sentence. i never read them back in the morning.
 whenever morning is.. even my macbook clock can’t keep up. 
all the travel isn’t in support of an album or anything like that really- past or ahead.
 there’s no label or touring firm dollars involved. all pennies from my pocket. in support of some odd daydream. ops to photograph crowds and clouds from planes. contrast all the quiet with some noise. new noise and old noise..sober crowd, faaded crowd. all welcome.

i can’t save the world.
 
my sun will die eventually.
 
one convenient part of being creative and well-resourced in life though, is that you can make a point to never be bored.
 oh and you can seclude yourself from the voices of fools. 
if you love me… when i’m done, let me vibrate in peace.

desensitized eyes on this body i am
…in this mirror i am.
 
i got ostracized and didn’t notice till i closed my eyes last a.m.
 
didn’t see.
 
i need a point to keep these eyes in focus.
 
i need my eyes to be quicker than your hands. they aren’t and won’t ever be- so when you do magic i won’t watch.
 see, my eyes have an ego. 
i need these eyes like..i need the holes in my head.
 i always find something off, like a hairline. 
symmetry gives me boner, it isn’t boring at all.
 
my eyes don’t bore me at all. neither do yours.
 i never saw you fuck, except that one time? i still get off to the residue that the image left behind. 
what i see inside my mind now isn’t technically with my eyes.
 
i heard about a third, but i’ll believe it when i see it blink on my forehead.
 
big head. five head.
 
eye don’t know
. eyes just talking.

LA is a bubble, one large iridescent bubble..
 
soap and ocean water.
 floating. 
at least it lets the planes out. & only the ears pop, never the bubble.
 
after you leave a while you’ll miss it.
 
although, you can really miss the worst things.. a cigarette, a doomed bus.
 
easy tiger,
 
i hold a deep affection for los angeles and it’s oppressive sunshine.
 
moms is moving here this summer,
 
my kid brother’s going to middle school. middle school. fuck, i’m getting old.. in los angeles.

NO MATTER HOW DIM IT GETS WHEREVER I AM
I never quit working. 
I work in the dark cause work is light.
 I tell my work all my problems because it never gives answers i have already. 
It never edits without me. Doesn’t call me names. I give my work away, because it doesn’t cost me much.
 In fact i’m indebted. I work hard since life is hard. Death is a soft place, it can wait. But work ain’t love. And love ain’t work. For sure.

I SEE NOTHING WRONG WITH LIKING THINGS THAT OTHER PEOPLE LIKE. SOLIDARITY CAN BE COOL.
 
I’M NOT JUDGING YOU. YOU’RE STILL AN INDIVIDUAL.
 
I’LL EVEN CALL YOU ‘INDIE’ IF THAT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER

[Verse 1:]
Sad he never takes her no where
And she always in these rooms
She was more than just a phone call
She says she's really in the mood

NO BETTER THAN THE NEXT MAN
, JUST DOING A DIFFERENT THING WITH MY TIME. GOT TO. I WANNA WRITE A NOVEL ABOUT TWINS, 
SOME TYPE OF NATURE VERSUS NURTURE TALE..
 I'VE SAID THAT TO A NEIGHBOR BEFORE. IT'S AN OPEN ENDED IDEA. 
I WANT TO START A CAR CLUB.
 I'm PLAYING WITH TWO NAMES FOR IT. I SKETCHED A LOGO FOR IT. IT'S NOT THERE YET. 
I WAS GOING TO BUILD AN ARCADE.
 THE MORE I LIVED WITH THAT IDEA.. THE LESS IT STUCK. IT'S MORPHING. SORT OF LIKE MY POTENTIAL RELOCATION TO NYC 
OR TOKYO
 OR SOME PLACE VERY FAR FROM THE COASTS OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS FALLING FOR SOMEONE NEW, IF I ALREADY HADN'T. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. IT WAS RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME. IT CAME AND WENT AND MAIMED US A LITTLE. 
NOT MUCH. I'VE POSSIBLY LOST ALL RELIGION
, I'VE SUNKEN INTO PASSIVITY IN CERTAIN AREAS OF MY LIFE.. ALL WHILE BEING THE HONEST OPPOSITE IN OTHERS. THE NUMBER ONE RULE IN RELATIONSHIPS, FROM WHAT I HEAR, IS TO NEVER JUST LEAVE. I FLEW AROUND THE WORLD IN 2012. HAD A SPECIAL TIME. 
I HAD BRUNCH AT THE ROOFTOP RESTAURANT FROM 'LOST IN TRANSLATION'. LIKE 9 TIMES.
 I FOUND ABSOLUTE SILENCE IN A MEDITATION SESSION IN THAT HOUSE IN THE HILLS. 
I HAVE A DOG WHO MISSES ME. HE'S SO BIG NOW.
 DAMN. HE KNOWS ABOUT AS MUCH AS ME, AS TO WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. I HAVE TO WRITE A SONG FOR SOMEONE NOW BECAUSE THEY PAID FOR MY TICKET AND MY HOTEL, AND I LET THEM. OH, I EAT STEAKS AGAIN NOW. IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS. ALL I REALLY HAVE TO SAY IS THAT LOVE IS ALL THERE IS. EVERY OTHER SENTENCE JUST BELABORS THE POINT. MAYBE NOT IN A BORING WAY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'm SAYING. 
I SAT IN THE STUDIO DAYS AGO WITH JIGGAMAN AND PHARRELL
. 
PHARRELL LOOKS 19.
 THEY SEEMED LIKE OLD FRIENDS. I WONDER HOW MANY TROPHIES ARE LODGED IN THEIR MINDS. I WONDER WHY THEY STILL BUILD. I BUILD THINGS FOR THE SPORT AND THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS. FOR IMMORTALITY BIIIITCH. 
I SAY IMMORTALITY IN JEST, BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW ONE THING FOR CERTAIN. HOLY FUCK, I DON'T WANNA WRITE ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.
 IT'S HARD TO ASCERTAIN WHAT'S HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THE LAST COUPLE YEARS. I SUPPOSE THIS IS WHAT GOING THROUGH THINGS FEELS LIKE. THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUTH. I CAN'T IMAGINE A DECADE FROM NOW. HOW I'LL FEEL ABOUT IT ALL. 
OREOS DON'T WORK WITH ALMOND MILK LIKE REGULAR MILK. THAT JUST CAME TO MIND. NOT SURE WHY. NO MATTER.
 I'm WORKING ON A LOT OF MUSIC. I'm GONNA GET BACK TO THAT NOW. 
GOOD NIGHT MOON.

Versace Versace I'll play the piano I'm not Liberace
You could stay seated I'm taking that Grammy your music is sloppy
Niggas is heated they keep on repeating the evening in slow-mo

Like when you get all that you wanted and that shit is not what you hoped it was
You had you a formula, one hit the wall now you Ayrton Senna
You had you a lady, then she hurt your ego, now you can't forgive her
Yea

I'm not even into Versace

[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California,
 
much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when...
[Pre-Hook]
I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
[Hook]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh
[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho,
 
since you think
I don't love you I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though
 
I'm lying down
[Pre-Hook + Hook]
[Bridge]
Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
[Hook]

[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Just a, just a, just a dream X3
[Verse 1]
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame
Fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade
I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet
(How'd I let my love breathe?)
[Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up X3
[Verse 2]
I'm in emerald city
, 
looking for Wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
To your heart again
I click my J's three times wishing she would've stayed
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Found a diamond for your ring
The crows on Saturn,
 
then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there
Levitating off the mattress
Baby where you at?
I said, oh, baby where you at?
[Hook]
I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up X3
[Outro]
It's just a dream

[Verse 1]
I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose but baby don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
[Hook]
I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try, you and I try, try, we all try
[Verse 2]
I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short,
 
this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something
[Hook]
[Outro]
Try to believe (just try)
I do believe, I do believe

[Verse 1]
Sitting next to your coffee table
I'm trying to fix your cable box, again
Said you couldn't get channel 4
And that's the only one you wanted to watch
[Pre-Hook]
Last week I was walking your dog, baby
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause
[Hook]
When I'm done
When I'm done
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
When I'm done (I'm gonna get it)
When I'm done (You're gonna get it)
You gonna feel every little bit of my love
[Verse 2]
Making love on the coffee table
Knock all the magazines off, yeah
You spilled your wine all over the floor
But guess who had to clean it up, yeah
[Pre-Hook]
Last week I was washing your towels
Scrubbing your dishes
Took your clothes to the cleaners
I don't mind, cause
[Hook x2]
[Bridge]
Well, g
imme some more baby
Gimme some more
It's never enough baby
You gotta let me know
You need something, tell me something, gather something to hold
Baby I'll do it
[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
I'm out in front of Supreme, like I own it
Buttercream Benz, goldfinger wheels
Driver can't steer, but look like Pam Grier
She like "Where's there parking around here"
That spots reserved, so are those right there
Reserved for who?
For pretty girls in sports cars
[Bridge]
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Cause my license been suspended
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Got my feet up on the wood grain, roof missing
[Hook]
You've got that whip appeal
Whipping my stick, shift, gear
You'd be a gun but you're a girl
Only if whipping could kill
[Verse 2]
Up and down Mulholland, on the weekends we chill
You're driving with no shoes - cruise control
Love the way you take the wheel
Got your photo on my air freshener
In a sense just like the
[Bridge] + [Hook]
[Verse 3]
I just finished practice
She's on her way to get me, she's in traffic
She said give her 20 minutes (I'm finna hop in the shower)
Girl I hope 20 don't mean an hour
And as the cold water runs over my chest
I've been thinking 'bout your skirt on my head rest
Pretty girl driving my sports car
Pretty, roof missing
[Hook x2]
[Verse 4]
I let you drive my Benz
Flossing all your friends around town
I let you fill my seats with shopping bags
I let you go do your thing riding with your friends round town
Riding with your girlfriends
And I always keep it clean
So why don't you park in the front just to stunt
That'll make all them bitches mad
Why don't you lift up the roof just to stunt
It'll make all them bitches mad
All them girls wanna be you
[Hook]

Could this be Earth?
 
Could this be light?
Does this mean everything is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and it was silent
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I'll forget 23 like I forgot 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what of all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
We'll all fade to grey soon, on the TV station

[Verse 1: Frank Ocean]
Could this be Earth? Could this be light?
Does this mean everything, is going to be alright?
When I look out my window there's trees talking like people
I've dreamt of storms, I've dreamt of sound
I've dreamt of gravity, keeping us around
I've slept in the darkness, it was lonely, and there was silence
What is this love? I don't feel the same
Don't believe what this is, could be given a name
I woke, you were there, tracing planets on my forehead
But I forget
[Verse 2: Melo-X]
I forget 23, shit what year was that?
Nowadays life can fly by so fast like cars you see on highways
Watch 'em driving past, they all got a destination
Many elders say that you should focus more on the steps that's takin
To get there, but damn it's taking too long, been waiting so long
Now I feel like I'm breaking my strong
Ways of thinking about the reality of this industry
And exactly what it takes for me
To get to where I want to be
If trees could speak
They would talk about these brand new humans that came around
Building things that brought smog around
Now, how's that for gentrification?
While I'm patiently waiting the arrival
Of real shit that goes viral
I speak to those with they eyes closed
Tell 'em open 'em up
Sit, back, relax and tote on a blunt
Frontin' like I been sober for months
Last night I was in the club laying drunk
Screamin' out what the, huh
Yeah you know the word
And at the end of the day I'm just tryin' to be heard
Ya heard
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
But I forget 23 like I forget 17
And I forget my first love, like you forget a daydream
And what if all my wild friends, and the times I've had with them
Will all fade to grey soon, on the TV station

[Verse]
Only a nascent trying to harness huge fire
Out on the beach in the darkness starting bonfire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Burning trees in the basement start a cool fire
Feel my heartbeat racing, baby you're on fire
So gorgeous, a man might cry
Back in Paris you told me you were suicidal
It's not a vacation if I lose you to the Eiffel
You're gorgeous but you can't fly
A hidden admirer sent me 
roses white as fire
We took our handfuls it was war, flower fighter
[Outro]
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire
Wildfire

[Verse 1]
Darker times
They’re telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we’ve got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn’t compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don’t let him see divide
Don’t you let her see divide
Voodoo
She’s got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He’s got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She’s got the whole wide world in her hands
He’s got the whole wide world in his hands

[Intro: Dr. TC]
Tyler we ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because, they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you
[Verse 1: Domo]
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the sky line
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this,
 
fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner yeah, yeah, yeah you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? We on top of the world
[Verse 2: Frank]
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars
, 
and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell
 
I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Beamer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says
 
fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter
 
that's
Where I'm at? Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at
?
[Verse 3: Hodgy]
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah I smoke weed
 
cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her
, 
but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world
[Verse 4: Mike G]
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid,
 
don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack
, 
work hard
I got the world saying every single
 
Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world
[Interlude: Tyler]
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?
[Verse 5: Tyler]
Down to fucking Earth
, 
huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do Clancy and Dave are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully I make a lot of porridge from
 
touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs
 
and hopefully I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
(Can we get backstage man?) No, faggot, it's sold out
(
Come on why you holding out
, 
I though we was boys, without me
You wouldn't be Tyler the Creator
, 
you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform
, 
a leopard can't change it's spots)
But I'm a fucking unicorn (Whatever man)
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
(Here’s some give a fuck, cake) Oh, maybe I should have some
(Asshole, have none)
 
How can I wake up on the wrong side
Of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
When I'm on that stage I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking
 
Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
At school I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero
 
and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics,
 
yeah I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it
, 
dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building
[Gunshots]

Wiseman closed his mouth
Madman closed his fist
Young man shows his age
Judge man named it sin
Bad man don' exist no
No evil man exists
Good man don't exist no
No righteous man exists
Sad man cannot cry in place where man can see
Never witnessed father weep
This old man thought it weak
But strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist no
Just flesh and blood exists
But your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you
The beast will crawl this earth
Then fall in the dirt to feed the crows
They'll rip apart his flesh
Til all that's left is glorious bone
So you'll bury your own
Too vain
You saw it unfold
What you know
And you claimed all you could hold
Until death did you part from the mess you made
I bet your mother would be proud of you
I bet your mother would be proud of you
Primate sharpens tool
To survive and thrive in the jungle
Maybe hearts were made to pump blood
Maybe lungs were made for flood
I won't blunt my blade for cut these chains
Rather let my limbs be dragged through mud
You're my brother but your eyes are cold
You're my sister but your womb is bare
I bet our mother would be proud of you
I bet our mother would be proud of you
Bad man don't exist
No evil man exists
I know good man don't exist
No righteous man exists
Strong man don't exist
No undying man exists
Weak man don't exist
No just flesh and blood exists

Wiseman closed his mouth
Madman closed his fist
Young man shows his age

[Intro: Stacy]
Hey, uh, call me back
I don’t mean...how I came after the other night
I just I had a lot to drink in
I wasn't thinking, I miss you, call me back!
[Verse 1: Stacy]
I've never known a love so strong
You’ve got my heart hemmed up in the palm of your hand
And therefore I surrender, never had to wonder boy
I’m wherever you are
You are , you are
And I can't sleep without you, tossing and turning
Turning and tossing, exhausted
Wondering where you could be
If not with me!
[Hook:]
You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you,I need you!
I need you!
Hmmmmmm
[Verse 2: Stacy]
I was born alone, but I don’t wanna die alone
It be a lonely life to live
If it was just me and all of this, no one to share it with
I'd give anything for a family and an apple tree
Upon the car seat up in the rear
Baby on board, baby on board
As I look forward..
See all of these things coming into tuition
But you're young, so young
[Hook:]
You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!
You are as necessary as the air I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!
[Verse 3: Frank Ocean]
Damn, I can’t believe it!
No, no, no can’t no, can’t believe it!
Baby 
I loved ya I did, ooh, I did ooh, I did
Keep a pair of your panties under my pillowcase
Ew, but baby that's real
What you didn't want me to lie?
What's gone, long gone
No, you didn’t like this
You didn’t like ‘till I was gone, long gone
Now I moved on, and you in your fucking DeLorean
[Outro: Both]
You are as necessary as the air the I breathe, I breathe, I breathe, I breathe
I need you!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without you, without you, without you, I need you!
Said I can't live without you
Live without you, live without you live without you
I can’t, no!
I need you in my life!
You’re like a vital organ I can’t live without, without you, without you, I need you!
I need you!

She sayin' bitch im paid,that's all I gotta say

After all these years i'd make a Weezy fan
Out of you too,you too,you too
When I met you,you were
Chris Brown,Beyonce,and Kells too,Kells too
When you met me I was
T.I.,BG,Juve,Outkast,and UGK (yeaaah)
But,we're both long way from home (Ohhh)
Got the windows down,radio on

You can kiss me,kiss me
My girl found it in the car,sayin' baby why you
Trynna diss me?Diss me
You knew you're my baby
You knew you're my baby (yeah)
I'm not just in it for the ride
I'm not just in it for the ride
I'm not just in it for the ride
I'm not just in it for the ride
Cos' you knew you're my baby

(Verse 1)
Fill it up that's all I got to say
Heres To the new you
Remember back when you were mine
And I was yours too
Now you're searching for somebody
Someone to hold you
You turn around I'm looking at you with a sign
Saying baby I love you
( Hook )X2
But Now i know that you are gone
We got the windows down radio on
(Verse 2)
Looking at with a smile saying
Baby do you want me to kiss you
You turn around with a smile saying
Baby do you want me to diss you
Cuz you know you're my babe
You know you're my baby
I'm not just in it for the ride
In it for the ride
( Hook )
Now i know that you are gone
We got the windows down radio on



[Verse 1]
A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy they pour when
[Pre-Hook]
I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
[Hook]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh
[Verse 2]
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho, since you think
I don't love you I just thought you were cute, that's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though I'm lying down
[Pre-Hook and Hook]
I'm thinking 'bout you (Ooh no, no, no)
I've been thinking 'bout you (You know, know, know)
I've been thinking 'bout you
Do you think about me still? Do ya, do ya?
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh
[Bridge]
Yes of course I remember, how could I forget how you feel?
You know you were my first time, a new feel
It will never get old, not in my soul, not in my spirit, keep it alive
We'll go down this road 'til it turns from color to black and white
[Hook]
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead
Cause I been thinking 'bout forever, ooh



“The best song wasn’t the single”, declares Frank Ocean on 'Sweet Life'. And on first listen you genuinely believe him – the first few plays of 
 give the feeling that these silky neo-soul numbers are slow burners which grow on you with each and every listen. It’s something somewhat unidentifiable, but there is an underlying novelty that oozes a certain class, that allures and intrigues, that boasts a certain swagger. But not in an obnoxious way of course, this is Frank Ocean we’re talking about – the most humble man in hip-hop, it’s in a way that only he could articulate, given the trials and tribulations he has faced up to this point in his life
It can’t have been an easy year for Frank Ocean, obviously the satisfaction of the success he has achieved recently must be rewarding, however with that success also came a limelight in which things got magnified intensely and before he knew it Stevie Wonder was calling him confused about his sexuality and Lil’ Wayne was claiming superiority over him for being straight. Coming to terms with something so personal, especially at this early stage in his career, can’t have been straightforward at all and it can be reflected in his music
 conveys so many different shades and styles throughout - there is pain, joy, sorrow, hedonism, yearning, confusion, money, fame, nostalgia, jazz, funk, R&B, rock, soul, psychedelia and more. And to his credit, there is a coherence that binds all of the above together to create a sultry mix of intelligent pop music. It is primarily due to the pristine production and it’s subtle uses of technological application coupled with the sheer artistic prowess of Frank and his collaborators. Unfortunately with Channel Orange though, Frank Ocean was wrong: the best song was in fact the single. ‘Pyramids’ purposefully romps along before dropping the pace into a sumptuous coda showcasing Frank’s ability to weave lush melody into his conversationally crooned anecdotes. The section also boasts arguably his finest, most concise, hook to date, with him simply singing – “Tonight, she’s working at the Pyramid”
The other tracks on here aren’t necessarily bad at all – ‘Thinkin Bout You’ is equally as memorable, but it appears that he has tried to distance himself from writing catchy songs. Mixtape 
 showed us he could pen an undeniably strong melody with ease, however here, he has focused too much on cramming too many colours into such a wide range of material and it feels sporadic and difficult. Sure, the sleek production gives it a certain togetherness, but the idiosyncrasies of melody and overall structure are too farfetched at times – the unconvincing verse melodies, the confusing segues, the alarming variation in track length: it’s Frank Ocean’s Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy without the meticulous pop know-how of Mr. West
A lot has been made recently of commercial music becoming less intellectual due to the simple melodies, structures and lyrics used; with 
, Frank Ocean has intellectualised it too far. Maybe we can look back on it in a few years and say it was a landmark album for changing popular music, and I hope for Frank’s sake that we can, but at the moment it’s simply too much too soon



"Three minutes forty five seconds, we are still a go at this time"
[Verse 1]
Listening to Star Trak's star
 tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end
Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl
[Climb]
But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Ohh up here, up here
[Hook)
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooohhh
"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"
[Verse 2]
The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, Big bang, look at what we made beautiful
[Climb]
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse oohh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no
[Hook X2]
"20 seconds and counting.Fifteen seconds and counting. Twelve, Eleven, Ten, Nine, ignition sequence starts, Six, Five, Four, Three, Two, One, Zero. All engines running. Liftoff! We have a liftoff!"





Yeah it's that lemonade
First Class yeah you know this is The Cook Up lets get it
O.K. I'm spitting these abortion bars all up on this lemonade
Got these other rappers really wishing they were never made
I'm always in the game these niggas never played
My gears always fucking sharp like I'm wearing blades
I only spit just so that I can get paid while these mothafuckas do it so they can get laid
I've been have these chicks open. Marcus Colston
Grabbing for my dick like a rebound. Postin
I got two bad chicks I call it double trouble and they both 10s that's a double-double
They got fat asses that's a double bubble
When they playing with my balls that's a double juggle
I'm serving up these bars call me the bartender
They say I should sell my rhymes but I'm not a bar vender
Man I just keep goin (goin) call me a machine
One of Octobers own but this ain't Halloween
I'm a punck line maniac this is my routine
The way I cook up all these bars you would think it's a cuisine
I'm not an undergroung artist more like a submarine
Got these mothafuckas bouncing kind of like a trampoline
I'm from that east coast, east side, EA we live we fly G5
Smoking up we high
Got your girl wet so I'm going in deep dive
The reason why all these schools buzzing. Beehive
Every where I go I always got my back pack
And girls ask me if I want to hit Black Jack
I'm made of money call me a casino
Make the haters sick to their stomach I should give them a beano
And I'm dangerous Scarface kind of like Pacino
When you see me call 911 Reno
Got a chip on my shoulder but I don't mean Doritos
And these niggas all beans it's a wrap burritos
I'm eight bars from greatness
The haters can't take it
The head above the shoulders I just see them shaking
Look I'm kind of gas I really can't fake it (no)
'cus if the right gears here my shit I'mma make it (Imma blowing up)
Yup man I know I'm gonna be blowing up and when that time comes I'mma drinking till I'm trowing up
In the club sipping bottle after bottle seeing 20/20 nigga I an't got them beer goggles
Chicks grinding on my slow moving like a snail man
And they open up for my delivery. Mail man
Look I got this on lot like a gel man
You think I'm being funny like Doug. Quell man
Dog I'm so serious
(not really)

[Verse 1:]
Ohh. Oh ohhh. Baby
I know I've been gone
I know it's been so long
And girl I hope you missed me
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
Though we talk on the phone everyday But that just don't do it for me
I need ya around me
I can't be without you
Shorty my plane just now touched down I'm a send a car to come get you from your house
So be ready in a hour
Just be ready
[Hook:]
We only got one night
The suns gone be setting in awhile.(You ready?, ready)
We still got moonlight
I'm down for whatever right now. (You ready?, ready)
Oh when the sky starts,sky starts changing
Sweet love we'll be making, ohhh
Just tell me (You ready, ready)
[Verse 2:]
Open up the door
Girl you got me throwed off
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl
You can feel my heart beat, nooo
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown
If you only knew what I'm thinking about
But now you're right here, ohh
And now it's so real
Shorty my plane leaves at 9 A.M tomorrow
But between then and now we came to fuck, ohhh
[Hook:]
[Bridge:]
Hey yo!
We got one, yo!
We got one, yo!
We got one hey yo!
Ohh, baby I'm a take it slow
I dont' wanna let you go, never let go
Ohh, I know you been patient
Been waiting for this moment
Right here, right now!
[Hook:]
[Bridge:]

Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That’s the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don’t wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won’t be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she’s already gone
How’d I get distracted I
Don’t know what happened 
I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got away away you flew away away ooooh
I lost my Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) Has anybody seen her?
I’m out here checking for my, Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) I’m posting pictures of her
(And where she go?) She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw her walking right past me
I called you didn’t answer to your name
Where’s my Angel? Where’d you go?
Where’d you go? Where’d you go?
[ Qaewin ]
Text alert saying "Hey" with two y's
So he type a text back, well he almost do then he don't go through cause he too shy
No I wasn't
Why you lie? You something...
Be honest
The conflict is you be holding onto your words, suppressing
Reflexively tryna' impress the less to gesture me
I'm a jester : meek,weak, and spineless tryna' be so celebrity
I'm sick of living in a closed box
I know it's not healthy but every time this prose stops
My heart's gettin' heavy
Steady tryna' plot
On any shot that I got
Better tell her
But I stop
[End]
How’d I get distracted I
Don’t know what happened I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got away away you flew away away ooooh
I lost my Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) Has anybody seen her?
I’m out here checking for my, Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) I’m posting pictures of her
(And where she go?) She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw her walking right past me
I called you didn’t answer to your name
Where’s my Angel? Where’d you go?
Where’d you go? Where’d you go?
Oh, Angel tell me what am I to do?
Angel I can’t find another you
Angel search downtown, now I’m on the 10 West
Doing 90 tryna get to you
Exit La Cienega, I’m looking, I’m searching
La Brea, Santa Monica, Sunset, Sepulveda
Robertson, Melrose and Hollywood
I lost my Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) Has anybody seen her?
I’m out here checking for my, Angel in L.A. L.A
(And where she at?) I’m posting pictures of her
(And where she go?) She got me driving around the backstreets

(Verse1)
Its been a minute since we spoke last after the situation
Things changed since then, heard that you're in a relation
You got a new occupation, better friends
And your own location
But im no fool i know there still inst hesitation
When i grab your hips dont kiss lips
I got you on reservation
Just cuz you changed your friends don't mean you any different
Cheated on me with just a friend
Yet claim you in love when
I know the difference between
Pretend
And being tense cuz ya man love ain't as deep as im is
So you come scratching back
As soon as i hint interest
That type of attention
Yo mind in another dimension
Yo mans fist clenchin
Your quenchin replenished
Finished but never complete
In my eyes you're obsolete for eternity
Cuz there's so many fish up in the sea
But you're a mermaid for shore
And life's a beach
And i can't put my head to sleep
On ground that sinks
7:26 do you know what that means?
Besides the time that boyfriend ya leaves
Whats that supposed to mean?
Basically instructions before lusting everything(like me)
Girl ima give you everything
That you want, yes of course the necessity
Closets at capacity
So much to wear but hard match with your vanity
Been flying high all night
The maid maybelline will pick up your backs come sunlight
Chilling with you got me numb like
(HOOK)
(Verse2)
Uh and she said, Love me right
And I said i just might
Kill ya liver with this liquor
Shots to the temple
Kill ya wisdom
Your hieroglyphics, tell your intention
I forgot to mention
The way you twist its like a swisha, girl you fire
Yeah a hot tea, Drink til i hiccup
Then wake up you fix your make up
Folgers in yo mans cup huh
He's in luck,he gets breakfast
I got lunch-able to treat you like a snack, its a fact
Once a cat gets that first scratch
Leave them to they rats
She a  she wolf just trying to hit pigments hit
Yeah girl you getting it
But I know ya momma raised ya with morals so
Why do i hear about what ya do with ya molars
Girl i heard ya bi - polar
I kick girls like you out my space - solar, Pluto
Girl dont you know girls like you end up like Juno
They dont care about  ya name
They just want va ja ne
Girls call me batman and robin
Cuz i gotham poppin
I had you on lock  uhaul
Heard you been around the block so much you could make a curb jealous, word
One day you gonna get burnt if you keep trying to taste some sun
It may feel good til ya go numb
Thats a super nova, thats more than a ouch
But anyway, we at your boyfriends house
On your boyfriends couch
Doing things that your momma wouldn't approve, there is no excuse but hum
(Hook)

[Intro]
I hear them calling for the cavalry
I told the judge don't bang the gavel please
I know I killed everybody here
But there's zero casualties
Why you hollering at the cavalry?
Please don't be mad at me
Even though I killed everybody here
I am not a criminal
[Verse 1]
I'm an animal, I'm a beast
And I'm coming for the east
You say all you do is win
But tonight you're gonna get defeated
And you're gonna taste defeat
I'm calling for the streets
You say this shit is heated
But I don't know what that means
I'm a beast, I'm a beast
And I killed everybody here
Sit your ass down, put your hands in the fucking air
Cristal sipping, city shit about to get real
I'm about to shoot some heads at will
They say money is the root of evil
But knowledge is much deeper
Smart criminals don't get caught
Like the Joker or Jack the Ripper
I hear them calling for my fucking head
I hear them hollering at the grim reaper
But I'm just tryna say what's real
So tonight you'll be a silent sleeper
[Hook]
I hear them calling for the cavalry
I told the judge don't bang the gavel please
I know I killed everybody here
But there's zero casualties
Why you hollering at the cavalry?
Please don't be mad at me
I know I killed everybody here
But I am innocent, nah
[Bridge]
I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal (Everybody here)
I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal (Zero casualties)
I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal (I ain't hating I'm just telling you)
I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal, I ain't a criminal (Now get up off my wallet please)
[Verse 2]
I'm rich nigga and you know it
But you broke and you show it
You wouldn't spare a dime for a hungry brother
And fuck is what you do to mothers
‘Cause you're a motherfucker, you're a little nigga
You're a little bitch, you're a gold digger
This a one off but I'ma give you fingers
No fucks, that's what I will give ya
And I can truly kill ya
I know where you live so you better close your windows
I hear you calling for the calvary but they ain't gonna help ya
So you better watch your feet or trip on my Semtex
Boom!
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
I'm staring at words
Cause what you don't know
Will never come back
And hurt you

As Julius I’m here to seize her sights
Thus I’m cruising down the Nile a mile from Luxor heights
Ocean says She’s working at the Pyramid tonight
Frankly I don’t doubt our legion view’s right
See traffic is rapid and the horn blowing incessant
They took Cleopatra and laid my guards silent
The throne of my Queen is empty and absent
Thus understand I’m here in no kind manner
All traitors will soon hold death’s banner
As the Chandeliers inside tremble from her voice
Cymbals crash the side until you make the choice
Remove your hold and bring her back delicately
Because she’s headed out the pyramid with me preciously

[Verse 1]
Got a heart full of gold, that I own
The clothes on my back and a pencil
I can draw my own money
You wouldn’t even tell the difference
But I just can’t sketch the feeling
I get when you’re not home
Or recreate the paintings
You’ve hung onto my soul
(Bridge)
Oh, oh but I bet they’re worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I’m a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can’t tell me nothing, nothing
(Chorus)
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
[Verse 2]
She got a heart made of glass
What’s inside of this like lightening in a bottle
Now what would that be worth in your museum
Recently we traded
And now that hearts my own
And since we’re sewed together
I feel like I got both
(Bridge)
Oh, and I bet they’re worth millions
Oh, beautiful works of love
Oh, I’m a go to all the fancy places
All the fancy people and
They can’t tell me nothing, nothing
(Chorus)
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
Time itself wants what I got
So I don’t care about what you’ve go
t
All I know is my girl is precious
You make me better, baby
You make me happy, baby
Nobody needs to remind me exactly why I’m
The richest man in the room
(Chorus)
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
Cause they all want what I got
And I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
They can’t buy what I got
Cause I ain’t got nothing but you
Nothing but you, nothing but you
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room
I'm the richest man in the room



I’ve been meaning to write you more. different hotels every night aren’t so bad really. in fact- all the moving house could inspire a photo series.. not for the gram, knowing me it’s probably only for whoever controls my estate in the future and enthusiastically develops all the rolls of film i forgot to. i’m in belgium, just 7 concerts into a tour with an ambiguous ending. i’d tour for a year if it didn’t interrupt my recording or my weekend driving. i really wanted to go to cairo in between europe and australia.. might let things settle some.. go to south africa instead and place some flowers on a gate for the president. for being epic and 94. i write on paper at night. my tour manager gave me a small powder blue book at the beginning of this run with gold embossed lettering on the cover that reads ‘one line a day’.. it’s easier than you’d think to narrow the entire cinema of your day into one sentence. i never read them back in the morning. whenever morning is.. even my macbook clock can’t keep up. all the travel isn’t in support of an album or anything like that really- past or ahead. there’s no label or touring firm dollars involved. all pennies from my pocket. in support of some odd daydream. ops to photograph crowds and clouds from planes. contrast all the quiet with some noise. new noise and old noise..sober crowd, faaded crowd. all welcome

Yeah, it's real simple bitch
You understand me?
Bitch I'm a player now
Your main bitch works for me
Yeah. Yeah
I haven't worn a shirt since 1993
That's the year I moved my operation to the beach
Half a dozen cameras on me when I'm in the streets
Pop, pop!
Hit out on me
Building mansions on the sand
Your girl looks like Kelis
She must hate you so much right now
She must hate you so much right now
Run my fingers through her hair
My girl looks like Kelis
Man she must love me so...

How many cars on the drive are actually yours?
You never go out for a ride, you keep them indoors
You got a big big mouth, a big 
big house
You're the king of cribs right now
A real big hit, no hard shit
I swear that won't change me one bit
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
The world will still go on without you
The newspapers still talk about you
And if your ever low, pick up the 
phone
I'll be 'round, don't tell a soul
Cause I'm not you, you're bullet proof
I'm in a crowd and I can't move
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
Let me in, let me in
Gimme the sunshine all year 'round
Lemme out, lemme out
Gimme it now, hear me out, hear me shout
Gimme the munchies , show me around
Lemme out, lemme out, gimme the reason
Gimme it now
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Gotta big big house, big big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
Big, big, house, big, big mouth
That's not helping me right now
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
Cause I wish I was someone else
Anybody else so maybe you might talk to me
Cause I wish I was not myself
Anybody else then maybe you might notice me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Mebody else now
