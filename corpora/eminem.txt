Imma tell you this for your own benefit
Your shit was dope as hell, specially when you wrote ninety percent of it
What you need to do is practice on your freestyles
'fore you come up missin' like Snoop Dogg's police files
This type of shit? bitch be sure that I'm spittin'
Be hittin', you gonna pray to god this shit was written
But it wasn't I'll kill a dozen rappers when I buzzin'
Guzzlin', beat your ass like a jealous husband
Now whos ya boy? 
bitch you about to suffer and see north
When you go in a coma longer than 
Vladamir Konstastinov
Cut the damn machine off
Get a clean cloth, and 
wipe this bloody video screen off
_________________________________________________________________
I'm movin' in for the kill, plus I got the trap set
I can tell you're wack as fuck, and I ain't even hear you rap yet
Look at you thinkin I'm about to whip his ass
Cause I'm a do some written shit, plus I get to go last
Well guess what ? even if I go first, it's no worse
My shit's still gon' demolish yo verse
I'm bout to slice you like a 
ginsu
And anything you say can and will be used against you
In a court of law, I'm short and raw
Take you fuckin' shit and cut it off
Yo, you wanna be a dope MC?
Look, don't get mad and start taking your period out on me
_________________________________________________________________
You wanna represent on the microphone but you rap sleazily
I ain't about to battle this fake ass Eazy-E
There ain't no way I'm a do this bullshit
I don't give a fuck
, I'm loaded up with a full clip
Time of the month, you couldn't get the tape of the day
Take him away, I ripped him like a paper mache
I've heard you rap before, you ain't about shit
This whole battle was mismatched like your outfit
Try to battle me and get your mouth split
You sold out like Ticketmaster Outlet
Ha ha, I bust and I crush, I don't give a fuck
Ain't no way that you can fuck with us
I'm givin back with pimp shit
I'll laminate that ass in a badge and wear it at the rap olympics
_________________________________________________________________
Blah-badee-blah-da-blah-blah, stop babblin'
You so fuckin' wack I'm a walk away while you battlin'
Fuck that, I'm on a brand new solo mission
To make sure that Wendy Day kicks your ass out of the rap coalition
I throw a switch at an execution
With an overdose of devotion don't talk back, I'm the dope, bitch
So who you sound like on the mic?
There was only one 2Pac, your thug style's just one Big Syke
Take a big hike, bitch you can't catch me
Your best rhymes still ain't shit like a patsy
What the fuck you gonna do?
I'll battle anybody in your crew and I don't give a fuck
I slaughter boys, especially wack ass emcees
That will wear a fake ass corduroy
_________________________________________________________________
I'm bout to make this mic short circuit
This beat is wack as fuck, this shit fits you perfect
I got so many ways to diss you that I'm playful with'ch you
I'll let a razor slit you 'til they have to staple stitch you
And everybody in this fuckin' place'll miss you
If you try to turn my facial tissue to a racial issue
Nobody's hearin' you, you're a wack liar
Damn, all you white jokes just backfired
Cause bitch you walkin' up the wrong street
Now go tell all your boys you was beat by a honkey
I don't give a fuck, I'll kill ya, bitch
You better recognize me like a look familiar
Anything you say I'm a kill ya, grill ya
When I fuckin' drill ya 
I'm Marsh but your the one that's mellow

I thought i would have a go at making a page and thought why not make an EMINEM fact page? so here it is, 10 facts about the rap god himself, EMINEM
Here we go:
1: 
Eminem doesn't allow people to curse in his home and he won't swear in front of his children
2: 
Eminem dropped out of Lincoln High School after failing 9th grade 3 times
3: 
Eminem came up with the name Slim Shady while taking a shit. He got the "Shady" part of the name from "Shady Lane", a street in his Detroit neighbourhood
4: 
As a nine-year-old, Eminem was beaten so badly by a school bully that he spent over a week in a coma. His music has since been credited with helping to bring more than one fan out of similar states, including a twelve-year-old girl who was hit by a car in Northumberland
5: 
As a young person, Eminem harboured ambitions to become a comic book artist rather than a rapper, which explains various animated threads through-out his career, including the ‘Mosh’ video and The Slim Shady Show series
6: 
Despite a tearaway image and numerous brushes with the law, Eminem didn’t clock his first arrest until aged twenty, appre-hended for shooting at a cop car with a paintball gun (Like in the movie 8 mile)
7: 
Like many artistic types, Eminem is left-handed. If you look hard enough, various writing dexterity clues are buried within his music videos, as well as movie '8 Mile'
8: 
Eminem was still making payments on his trailer home when The Slim Shady LP dropped
9: 
In order to record Hailie's part of "97 Bonnie and Clyde", Eminem told Kim he was going to Chuck E. Cheese
10: 
Eminem was fired from Gilbert's Lodge five days before Hailie's birthday, which falls on Christmas, and with only $40, wrote "Rock Bottom" the same night
There you have it, 10 Eminem facts. Stay tuned for the sequel "10 more EMINEM Facts"
Thanks

How the fuck he got an Oscar
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of K-Mart plaza
Across from the Red Lobster
Looking like the Loch Ness Monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap, it costs less to gossip
I'll probably be a lot less hostile
If you snots kept your schnozzes out the air holes
You'll get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy yeah, both ears and ha yes nostrils
At the OzzFest
 
with Nas
Bumping Das EFX
 
in a wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson Vicodin out my pocket
They cost less
I'm a hot mess
Cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasps nest in the process, awesome
Drunk as fuck, one sock
Pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking Hydroxycuts
And four oxi’s stuck in my esophogus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screaming 
"serves you right you cocky fuck
That's what you get for mocking us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was"
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
Said it was a sock puppet
So no strings attached
You can all suck it
Chicka get it, ah fuck it
Shit’s bout to get as hairy as motherfucking Chewbaca's nuts
Cocksuckas

Too late for the other side
Caught in a chase, 25 to life
[Verse 1]
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I woulda stayed
But I've already wasted over half my life
I woulda laid down and died for you, I no longer cry for you
No more pain,
 
bitch, you took me for granted, took my heart and ran it
Straight into the planet, into the dirt, I can no longer stand it
Now my respect I demand it:
 
I'mma take control of this relationship
Command it, and I'mma be the boss of you now, goddammit
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me
So you better hear me out, this much you owe me
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you I have stayed
Faithful all the way, this is how I fucking get repaid?
Look at how I dress: fucking baggy sweats,
 
go to work a mess
Always in a rush to get back to you, I ain't heard you yet
Not even once say you appreciate me, I deserve respect
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left
But you keep treating me like a staircase, it's time to fucking step
And I won't be coming back, so don't hold your fucking breath
You know what you've done, no need to go in depth
I told you you'd be sorry if I fucking left,
 
I laughed while you wept
How's it feel now, yeah, funny, ain't it? You neglected me
Did me a favor, though, my spirit free you've set
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept,
 
it's unfortunate but it's
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh
Cause that ain't good enough, you expect me to fold myself in half
'til I snap,
 
don't think I'm loyal, all I do is rap
How can I moonlight on the side, I have no life outside of that
Don't I give you enough of my time, you don't think so, do you
Jealous when I spend time with the girls, why I'm married to you still, man
I don't know, but tonight I'm serving you with papers
I'm divorcing you: go marry someone else and make 'em famous
And take away their freedom like you did to me
Treat 'em like you don't need 'em and they ain't worthy of you
Feed 'em the same shit that you made me eat, I'm moving on, forget you
Oh, now I'm special? I ain't feel special when I was with you
All I ever felt was this helplessness, imprisoned by a selfish bitch
Chew me up and spit me out,
 
I fell for this so many times it's ridiculous
And still I stick with this,
 
I'm sick of this
But in my sickness and addiction, you're addictive as they get
Evil as they come, vindictive as they make 'em
My friends keep asking me why I can't just walk away from
I'm addicted to the pain, the stress, the drama,
 
I'm drawn to shit
I guess I'm a mess,
 
cursed and blessed
But this time I ain't changing my mind, I'm climbing out this abyss
You're screaming as I walk out that I'll be missed
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you, you left me off your list
Fuck you, hip hop, I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served, bitch and it's just...
[Hook]

[Royce da 5'9"]
Ryan's a homicidal misfit,
 
I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff in some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violent psychotic wit
Devour, polish it, politics
By the way I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower tip
I like writing, but I will stick this pencil in your ass
Before I write your shit,
 
pause,
 
inhaling hella kush
Us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felons, crooks, going door-to-door
Like we selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mushed
Now my bitch a dancer, I'm about as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you'd probably rip your pants up
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It probably will smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me Anchorman, I hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water, then go and drown a fish
Fuck, I'm fucking heinous
, 
I make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming
, 
fuck is you saying?
[Eminem]
FUCK! It's fucking raining, SHIT! There's lightning, BITCH!
It's thundering cause I'm cussing up a storm if you wondering, SHIT!
SHIT! You couldn't muster up enough thought
To take a dump during a brain fart, chump
If you want urine in your face, all you had to do was say
That you wish you would've just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolize the game, illuminati is here
Yeah, human oddities, at odds with us, your squad's gotta be
Cause we started out cold in a snowball, we froze
Soon as we rolled up on these hoes
, 
all's we know
Is y'all lowered the bar like limbo, you know who you are
So quit fucking the dog before we start calling YOU Bizarre
Shit, screw the pooch, y'all done raped a pitbull
Fell in love with the shih-tzu
, 
this missile's directed directly at you
And this for these hoes who don't know me from a can of paint
You must be huffing
, 
fuck a ball sack
If the taints can't take you on a date
, 
you mistake me for a gentleman
You 2000 and late
, man, and 
Will I ain't
, I'm the bad guy
Type of guy that will drag five girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants, 
and the first one who pees gets a black eye
[Hook: Eminem]
Must be outta your mind, you think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts, bitch, hang it up, this game is over
[Joell Ortiz]
Puffin' loosies, watching "I Love Lucy" with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me?
 
I'm Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don't know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
'Til then I kill the bad man trying to slay me
Everything you kick weak, your spit kung fughesi
All my homeboys, 2.0 Boys
Nickel, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain't got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moiss
Bang bang, bang bang, House Gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you pussies, don't ask what we came for
I write until my right arm veins sore
Forearm feel like Thor's arm in a gang war
You hear that? Yaowa
, 
you know who finna fall out
Definitively finish you, my fist take out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a Jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight
[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers
, 
cesspoolers,
 
meth abusers
You step to us, text 
Rugers
 to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to Nayhood, big in the 
'jects
, G
Cheated death multiple times without rigging the deck
So I'm well-prepped if you just want war
There will be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It's raw, you keeping acting like you don't know Mouse, nigga
And you going to need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought's rotten, they gems are fool's gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I'll exonerate
I'm Martin King staring at a picture of Obama's face
Talking funds, niggas ain't never seen stock
I don't need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock
[Hook]
[Crooked I]
Take off, you invited inside of the mind of
A psychotic rhymer, I'm kind of a (Dahmer)
I'm grinding up rappers are lining up jackers, 
I'm climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors,
 
I'm the genuine article
But read me wrong
, 
get my gun and split you to particles
(The gold hand)
 Tell me when and I'm there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like unlimited fare
You got us pegged wrong,
 
my circle don't fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it's coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I'm a step on you, bring it to your yard
Bogart for arts
, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads
, 
I coast guard the West
I'm Mozart, I compose dark shit with no heart
[Yelawolf]
I got Jim Beam in the liver
, 
getting head like clean clippers
With haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16's like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain't seen sicker
Than a cracker that will hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk
, 
my pump will stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that's as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit, they think I'm Illuminati, so fucking ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin
, 
but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging,
 
it's only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love what the clown's sanging
I'm a freak shows at the county carnival, then you paying
Bitch, 
I'm on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling "Go Shady!" Driving slower than an old lady
In an old '89,
 
no piece if you pay me
Give me peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I'm getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago would have broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain't fucking with Budden, you ain't got no choice with Royce
You don't want to see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile
, 
the point oh boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then, homie, I deploy
 
game over
[Eminem]
Yo, I don't think they heard you, tell 'em again
[Yelawolf]
Game over!

[Eminem]
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white,
 
sometimes I just hate life
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, 
it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up {*wham*} I just slam shut
I just can't do it,
 
my whole manhood's
Just been stripped
, I have just been 
vicked
So I must then get, off the bus then split
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road
[Hook]
I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin
Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road
[Eminem]
I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, and the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap,
 gotta move 
ASAP
And get a new plan, 
momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad!
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step,
 
don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much man
, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are
Yo I'm tellin' you dawg
 I'm 
bailin'
 this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow
On everything I own,
 
I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road
[Hook]
[Eminem]
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance
, 
a certificate
Of authenticity
, 
you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned,
 
havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MCs in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go
Who must I show, to bust my flow
Where must I go, who must I know
Or am I just another crab in the bucket
Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit foot so fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit
At the 
Salvation Army
 
tryin to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this
 
battlin mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one,
 
the city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot
, 
sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin I just blow,
 my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now
, 
I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road
[Hook]

Verse 1
:
You probably gonna think that I'm talking
About you and you goddamn right I am
Look at you,
 
this is the minimal I could diss you
Subliminally,
 
but I think criminal instinct
Has pushed me to the brink,
 
my pussy does it stink
He still loves me cause he puts me in his ink
He does, doesn't he, still is, isn't he?
Nah, I'm just playing tug of war with his heart cause he misses me
I can still fuck him and leave him whenever I feel frisky
And is no risk of disease cause he ain't with anyone is he?
This bitch really thinks she can get me
If she still wants me, driving across country
Strapped up to the front seat, missing all her front teeth
Thinking to herself when's the next time he's gonna punch me?
I told this cunt she's gonna over-do it once
And once she does, she was stuffed up in a trunk
Crunch,
 
he scrunched her up in a ball
Bunched up nice and comfy
Fuck around get dumped up in a lake 'fore you dump me
You cunning little cunt,
 
deceitful witch
You thought you had me
, 
'till my shrink told me this
Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover
Verse 2:
I feel like a serial killer I keep dumping bodies in the lake
I'mma get caught and send up the river
 
I shiver
When I think of the company I keep
How do I know she ain't gonna kill me when I sleep
I shriek, every time she hands me something to drink
Sex kept us together
, 
when we slept together every-thing
Was all better
,
 
she made me feel like a king
Slowly, she began lowering my self-esteem
She go to the club and not answer the phone when I call her
And
 
I just bought her a truck for 50,000 dollars
Accused me of doing drugs and scream 'n holla"
Then I find a bag of coke on her, some marijuana
And all I know is every time I go
To them hiding spots,
 
wherever she hides her
 
blow
The little bags of dope, there was a pile of coke
That's growing smaller
, 
and that was just a while ago
And I wouldn't even let on like I know
What was I supposed to do, call her out on it
, 
we just argue
Say she put it there on purpose and flipped the whole script
Ooh she's a manipulative evil bitch
A cunning little cunt, little deceitful witch
She thought she had me, 'till my shrink told me this
Hook:
The problem is all inside your head she said to me
The answer is easy if you take it logically
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free
There must be 50 ways to leave your lover

(Chorus)
Skam:
Yo I'm tryin to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
See the bullshit you sayin, Skam ain't tryin to hear (Fuck that!)
Bustin lyrics in the air
Keepin some up in the chamber
Eminem:
Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin?
Skam:
Man, I'm releasin anger
Eminem :
I'm tryin to be the illest of the day
Three six five a year
See that bullshit you sayin, Shady ain't tryin to hear
Spittin lyrics in your ear
Keepin some up in the chamber
Skam:
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin?
Shady:
I'm releasin anger
[Verse 1: Skam]
Man I'm tired of bein tired, everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin, and endin up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu,
 what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, gettin so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin to roll up on Miami, leavin with a broke neck
Oh shit, leathal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin up white rappers like im throwin gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?)
(Chorus)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dane
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is, turnin to yellow with orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genuis
, 
too extreme for the weak and squeemish
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each others name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started
Cock block your fathers game
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out
I'mma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out
(Chorus)

[Hook]
Now what you know about a sweet MC,
 
from the 313
None of these skills you bout to see come free
So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me
If you ever wanna be one see
[Verse 1: Eye-Kyu]
Yo some people say I'm whack, now if that's right
I'm the freshest whack MC that you ever heard, in your lifetime
My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats
Boy I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets
Forget a gold digger's succubus; my souls thick with ruggedness
With the mic I'm like a dyke,
 
can't no nigga fuck with this
I got more Different Strokes than Philip Drummound
On open mic I bone your women just to keep my lyrics coming
We elevated to new heights premeditated
Let it be that I stated they hate it now that they see that I made it
The escalated can be put to the test of greatness
Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it
So I take it that's the reason I'm hated
To represent's my temperament
If rap was a dick all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent
But pimping it, and acting like you could rock a show
Harder than LL's Rock the Bells, but you is a ho
Everything that you collaborate I lacerate
My rhymes they keep coming like nymphomaniacs that masturbate
At a faster rate,
 
yeah I got something for your ass to hate
I blast your hate, and have you all running master gates
And as for face clutching and touching the flows
I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose
Buckin' these hoes, I got that shit down to a science
Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on like an appliance
Defiance, no we won't have that
You want your shit to blow up
Well I'mma stuff some dynamite in your ass crack
And blast that shit to kingdom come
Then bring them some of this real hip-hop
I drop beats and you ain't singing or gonna do a thing about
And you all knew from Meeko
That you couldn't hold your own
 
with the strength of Lou Ferrigno
So stop that bullshit and flow
Yo, you need to come with the real skills, and act like you know
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what, you know about a sweet MC, in the 313
You don't know shit so when you see one flee
You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
I'll stop the alphabet at S and got it down to a T
I'm sure your bound to agree, a sweet MC crashes the spot
I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
Your ass forgot, so just in case you don't remember me
I'll run your brain around the block to jog your fucking memory
It's either them or me man, kill or be killed
You will will be sealed your casket closed you still will be billed
My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity
I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his ass shitty
If he's acting soft and he cowers
He better come cleaner then Jeru jackin' off when he showers
You flowers got no clout with a thing
You could date a stick of dynamite and wouldn't go out with a bang
I shout with a slang, simple as A,B,C's
Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease
Dethrone MC's and I'mma max alone
Relax your dome like a solo from a saxophone
So facts are known, writers get treated with shocks
I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks
I'm greeted with flocks, of fellow followers' singers
You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands
If they swallowed their fingers
But you can bring yours let's see what you got
But don't front and never try to be what you're not
Cause you can be quick, jump the candlestick, burn your back
And fuck Jill on a hill, but you still ain't Jack
[Hook]

[Hook- Skam (Eminem)]
Yo, I'm trying to be the man of the day, three six five a year
See the bullshit you saying, Skam ain't trying to hear (Fuck that!)
Busting lyrics in the air, keeping some up in the chamber
(Yo Skam, what the fuck you doing?) Man, I'm releasing anger!
(
I'm trying to be the illest of the day, three six five a year
See that bullshit you saying, Shady ain't trying to hear
Spitting lyrics in your ear,
 
keeping some up in the chamber)
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doing? (I'm releasing anger!)
[Skam]
Man I'm tired of being tired, every time I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of being late for the bus
Tired of all be blending, and ending up dating sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold digging bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fitting, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear, spitting like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag, I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done 
we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, getting so damn drunk
Can't remember the lass ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex
, in the street got me veck
Trying to roll up on Miami, leaving with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stacking up white rappers like I'm throwing gas signs
And I'm, buck wild exposing the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fucking shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jamming like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doing?)
[Hook]
[Bridge]
"I just wanna figure something in my head
And maybe you can help me out here
When a person is insane, as you clearly are
Do you know that you're insane?
And you're just sitting around reading Guns & Ammo
Masturbating in your own feces
Do you just stop and go
"Wow, it's just amazing how fucking crazy I really am"?"
[Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out
[Hook]

[Intro]
There is no escaping, there's no place to hide
You scream someone save me, but they don't pay no mind
Goodnight, goodbye
[Verse 1]
You're walking down a horror corridor
It's almost four in the morning and you're in a, nightmare it's horrible
Right there's the coroner, waiting for ya
To turn the corner so he can corner ya, you're a goner, he's onto ya
Out the corner of his
 
cornea,
 
he just saw ya run
All ya want is to rest cause you can't run anymore, you're done
All he wants is to kill you in front of an audience
While everybody is watching in the party, applauding it
Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again
Contemplating my next plot again,
 
swallowing a Klonopin
While I'm noddin' in and out on the ottoman
At the Ramada Inn,
 
holding onto the pill bottle, then
Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom and
Make sure I got all of it,
 
wake up naked at McDonald's
 
with
Blood all over me, dead bodies behind the counter, shit
Guess I must'a just blacked out again,
 
not again
[Hook]
It's 3 a.m. in the morning,
 
put my key in the door
Bodies laying all over the floor and
I don't remember how they got there
But I guess I must'a killed 'em, killed 'em
[Verse 2]
Sitting nude in my living room, it's almost noon
I wonder what's on
 
the tube,
 
maybe they'll show some boobs
Surfing every channel until I find
 
Hannah Montana
Then I reach for the aloe and Lanolin
Bust all over the wall panelin'
Dismantlin' every candle on top of the fireplace mantle and
Grab my flannel and my bandana then
 
kiss the naked mannequin man again
You can see him standin' in my front window if you look in
I'm just a hooligan who's used to using hallucinogens
Causing illusions again,
 
brain contusions again
Cutting and bruising the skin, razors, scissors and pins
Jesus, when does it end?
Phases that I go through, dazed and I'm so confused
Days that I don't know who
 
gave these molecules to
Me,
 
what am I gon' do? Hey,
 
the prodigal son
The diabolical one,
 
very methodical when I slaughter them
[Hook]
[Bridge]
She puts the lotion in the bucket
It puts the lotion on the skin
Or else it gets the hose again
[Verse 3]
I cut and I slash, slice and gash
Last night was a blast, I can't quite remember when I had that
Much fun off a half pint of
 
the Jack
My last Vic and a half,
 
a fleshlight of
 
Kim Kardashian's ass
I remember the first time I dismembered a family member
December, I think it was: I was having drinks with my cousin
I wrapped him in Christmas lights, pushed him into the stinkin' tub
Cut him up into pieces and just when I went to drink his blood
I thought I oughta drink his bath water, that oughta be fun
That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun
The sight of blood excites me
; 
that might be an artery, son
Your bloodcurdling screams just don't seem to bother me none
It's 3 a.m. and here I come, so you should probably run
A secret passageway around here, man, there's gotta be one
Oh no, there's probably none
, 
he can scream all that he wants
Top of his lungs, but ain't no stopping me from chopping him up-up
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless,
 
patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd, Sr
And smackin' his back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in the wild hood
 
as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed
 
but kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death as I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind,
 
you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not? Blow your brain out, I'm blowing mine out
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now
[Verse 2]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my damn umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a 4 door Ford
But I'm more towards droppin an acappella
 
that'll chop a fella
To Mozzarella,
 
worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in the cellar
 
with your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia
 
while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your veins feeding you liquid darvicet
Pumping you full of drugs, pull the plugs
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants and given
A less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement, it's a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arson
To set fire to carpets
 and burn up your entire apartment
I'm a liar to start shit
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick
So tight, you need a crobar to pry her apart with
[Verse 3]
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg
Go to bed with the keg, wake up with the 
40
Mix it with 
Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D
Fuck an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
I'm blowing up like spontaneous human combustion
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross the bombers? We blowing up your house killing your parents
And coming back to get your foster mommas
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't making no more threats
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
I'm more or less sick in the head
Maybe more cause I smoked crack 
today, yesterday and the day before
Saboteur,
 walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!

[Verse 1]
(Aight, aight...Uh...
Slim Shady
...Yo, yo, yo...)

Yo, yo, yo!
My mom sent up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (here)
Two dudes ran up and jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast, it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs, pinned him, and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one,  lit him on fire, pinned, and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept dropin' 'em in a rhythm
Then I woke up swingin' the middle of the kitchen
(Damn... damn... damn...)

[Shabaam Shadeeq]
Of course I rap till I'm hoarse
Add the sauce to them jive turkey mc's
Say what you like, I toss
Your theory when you hear me like the guts of a dutch
Snap caught you in the act like Vivitar AF
2-5-5 Autofocus clear vision
Precision mics for people of all types
Call the calvary
Mic brutality, 
switch the pitch gradually
Aqua, turn-table knocka
Fresh like Binaca
Jot the thoughts in my chronicles
Remarkable styles
Made an exit to spark mine
Nuclear physics, mechanicals and phat rhymes
They know the time like a sun-dial
I'm X-File
[Eminem]
Went to bible class with a gun, blasted a nun
Fuck hell, Satan sent my ass to the sun
I wasn't born, I was hatched
And dumped in the trash
 
with a note attached
Sayin' someone please whip this brat's ass
I never gave a rat's ass or a flyin' fuck
Drivin' drunk in a fire truck with the siren stuck
Slammin' the brakes, skiddin' out cause the tires suck
Went to pull you off my dick and got the pliers stuck
You better run cause I'm probably the only one
Crazy enough to shoot your ass with a knife and stab you with a gun
I like fire, you might see me start it
I'm slightly retarded, I miss my sanity since the night we departed
[Skam]
Yo Old World Disorder on some outnumber shit
We'd rather go out of control then to be under it
Yo how you gonna win against us when we got nothin to lose
Must be confused
Or prayin to a God that don't exist
It wouldn't save your bible-kissin asses even if he did
We like to twist ya mystic, genetic dead-end
Don't got friends
Skam and Shadowman, posting children for depression
Stress in any language
Say my name in Spanish
That's "Chupacabra", suck the life out of you
There won't be enough of your brain left to fill a teaspoon
We two vanishing men that makes the bad things blend
And probably go platinum on the day that the world ends
"Rhymes that you never even heard before..."
[A.L.]
When it comes to beef
I gets relief when I kill and breathe
Send a wreathe get your family ready for the grief
I'll knock ya teeth
Take ya seat like a thief
Make you change your beliefs
Burn a leaf before you go beneath
Rappers, I kill 'em
Down to Hell is where I send 'em
Feelin' my pen is illin so much
I need some penecilin
Jams I'm spillin cause I'm bound here
Kicking shit that's solitaire
Your crown is RIP cause rapper you sound counterfeit
You get a round of clips
If you play hard
You stay scarred
Thinkin you're brave ya'll
You're in a graveyard
One in a mil' son
I'm ill when it comes to skills
Wanna get killed or catch a dum-dum in your grill
Rappers diminishin, in scrimmage
I'm good to the finish
I'll speak in English while your brothers are speakin in gibberish
You touch the mic and I'm out to bury your fingers
You want some fame? I'll beat you up in front of Jerry Springer
So pay the price, say they nice
When they play the dice
I'll take you life, slay you twice
Before you break your rights
[Kwest Tha Madd Lad]
Cats who rap are feminine
I'm sendin this without the benefits of cinema scents of cinnamon
So submit it in your mental
Since you find it essential to stencil simple sentences
A sentence is simple
You banned from usin writin utensils
Whether crayon, pen or pencil
Observe verse packed with syntax
That causes skin cracks on impact
Send them wack men back to the lab
Where most of them laugh
I can hand you a manual to make what I plan to do more tangible
You still wouldn't understand the full concept
It slips through your fingers like sand granules
Scan the land and the blue sea annually
And you will see
Which animals eat amphibians from spittin up that written stuff
It’s all the same
It’s the reason for cyphers prematurely spittin' up
Ironic phonics show my flow is far from ambionic
To be honest no hits of chronic in mi bionic
I'm beyond it
The texture of my lecture is complex like a professor
Skeptics greet me exceptional when I bless sound receptacles
Much stretchin through my vestibules
Turns crews to vegetables
They grab my testicles and cup em
Fuck em, bless em through, what

[Intro: Eminem]
Good morning!
Wake your motherfucking asses up!
Y'all with us or what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is
Stop sleeping on my group, BITCH!
[Eminem]
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me having my ass whipped
Cause I'mma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with
I just can't get passed these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it, cause we can and they can't spit
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it?
Hip-hop isn't a sport anymore
When you gotta go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my passion
Is to smash anyone rapping without having to slap him
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol
When I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how
Far it gets took on the mic
Cause I'm telling you right now you're not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pulling you with me
You poke a stick at a pitbull, you get bit, B
Your words stick to you like crazy glue when you diss me
Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50
I'm the beautiful-est thing, and you're gonna miss me
When I'm gone, like Keith Murray when he threw his stool
And hit a girl accidentally
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof
 - 
are you with me?
[Hook: Eminem]
Come on then, everybody come on and
Kick your shoes off motherfuckers
, 
come on IN
Cause we get it on and, 'til the break of dawn and
Wake your ass up motherfuckers, quit yawning
Cause we ain't leaving 'til 6 in the morning
So have a sing along with the words of the song and
If you don't know the words and you can't sing along then
Fake like you know 'em motherfuckers and join in
Everybody good morning
[Swifty]
They consider me the epitome of a beef starter
In the party with heat, it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs, 
I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly 
popping slugs
, they hot son, better not run (AHH!)
The bosses of all bosses;
 
a holocaust to whoever ain't cautious
In a house full of dog shit
I'm a Gothic death prophet, you'll stop breathing
You'll die quicker than mach speed without bleeding
It ain't about what you reading
When you meet me better speak like it's Seasons Greetings
Either that or we'll be beefing frequent
You niggas need an E just to speak shit
And your 
heater
 is a petite bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I'll snipe you with it and 
won't even keep it a secret
Nigga, I did it from the mind of a mental patient
When Glocks sway you can save that conversation for Satan
You brave?
[Hook]
[Kon Artis]
I heard you niggas don't like us but so what,
 
this beef is like what the fuck
Did he say in his rap?
 
Em, I can see that he just a punk
I mean these niggas'll squeeze on me pleased when seeing guts
I don't need no enemies cause my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seeing the mic, they empty out on them bike
To fight you in front of everyone important that I don't like
No need for metaphors to get points across when I write
This emotion's enough to say, "Fuck you bitch and I don't like you!"
WHAT! I might as well give this up, but that'd be selfish as fuck
You'll leave D12 in this, but we can't self-destruct
I've never felt it this much, c'mon fellas get up!
We gotta fight like Bugz last night of his life, C'MON!
[Kuniva]
I walk with a limp,
 
pistol
 hanging off of the hip
I'm awkward and quick enough and sick when sparking a fifth
Your carcass is split, even if beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probably wish that you could be out, shooting at 
G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze, I can't believe
You speaking on moving keys,
 
but every time we hear you kick it
The only thing that you selling is woof tickets
I look wicked cause niggas'll test your nutsack
So when they bust you better bust back or 
get your guts clapped
Outta your stomach, and when they want it
I'll bring a hundred niggas from Runyon so get to gunnin if you coming
[Hook]

[Rabbit]
Your style is generic
Mines authentic made
I roll like a renegade
You need clinic aid
My technique is bizarre and ill;
I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
As I proceed to cook and grill ya
That’s all that took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You want to battle
You beat around the bush
Like you're scared to lick pussy so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push
Someone that I can bully
Wait a minute I don’t think you understand fully
See me without a style
Is like mustard without the Hienz’s
I lead the new school
You a BUSTA without the RHYMES
I crush the shit out your lines

Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313, put your motherfucking hands up
Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf
1, 2, 3, and to the 4
1 Pac, 2 Pac, 3 Pac, 4
4 Pac, 3 Pac, 2 Pac, 1
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfucking MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming, fuck the Free World
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dog, you embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he shook
Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look in his fucking yearbook
Fuck Cranbrook
Fuck a beat, I'll go a capella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, 
Renegade is back
Em the beat is sick
It's Young, 
Freeway
, 
8 Miles
, let's go
8 miles and running, 
got my 7th album dropping
And my 8th album coming
, 
feeding a thousand growling stomachs
But I can rewind the calendar back, back when it was now or nothing
People said I would amount to nothing, that I had talent for nothing
Said I would succumb to violence or be silenced by a gunman
I could just hear the folks now, "He got what he had coming"
Now that my eighth album's comin' everybody's smiling
Wanting something, claiming that they done something for him
Got their Jay-Z pom poms and their Hov uniform
Claimin' they been running and telling everybody like Martin Lawrence
'Bout how hot my rap performance was before I was who I was
Claiming that they threw it up before I threw it up
You what? Where was you before I blew this up?
I didn't see you in the courtroom when everybody was suing us
I didn't see you in all black when everybody was suiting up
Back on the block, getting it in, there wasn't no you with us
[Hook: Jay-Z]
8 miles and running, got my 7th album dropping
And my 8th album comin', feeding a thousand growling stomachs, 
Free
[Freeway]
6 miles and running, got my fifth strip popping
And my first album coming
, feeding twenty growling stomachs
[Jay-Z]
8 miles and running, got my 7th album dropping
And my 8th album coming, feeding a thousand growling stomachs, Free
[Freeway]
6 miles and running, got my fifth strip popping
And my first album coming, feeding twenty growling stomachs
[Freeway]
6 miles and running in the 
Pontiac
Six thousand eighty six
, trans might shift while the engine run
Now tell ya riders give me one more chance
And them smokers screaming, "One more gram"
So I'mma bring 'em one
Only son to my pop, stick close to my momma
Keep toasters for drama, 
make Salat with my son
My son growing and he learning a lot
That's when them toasters, when the burners will pop, brain on ya um-
Brella a nigga, tell 'em niggas
That's like the Biblical scripture
Look back, turn to salt like the sinners
Most of ya heartless and self-centered like Meshach and Mesha
Set up ya brother cuz you jealous, nigga
The heat back, like you never left
I ever rep, cops watch every step
Six miles and running dodging every trap
The rap gingerbread man, cheer us
Every precious breath, State P the second gat
[Hook]
[Jay-Z]
Back when nobody would find he had talent, nobody would sign me
Nobody believed in me, nobody but mommy blindly
But how can she deny me? Me being the youngest runt
To come up outta her tummy, she got nothin' but love for me
When niggas would one me, the industry shunned me
That's why I'm takin' all the industry's money
Revenge is sweet honey, we run this
Young is the illest, 
Free is the future
Beans and Bleek
 is right now, we can see y'all 8 miles nigga
[Hook]

[Intro - Eminem]
WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!!! {*laughs*}
Guess who's back?!?!
Mommy! We're home!!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!!!
[Verse - Eminem]
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans
, 
they knowing when D-Bo was
50
, 
Tweezy,
 
Obie
 
there won't be no ho in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York 
down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out
And that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off
[Hook - Eminem]
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911
[Verse - B-Real]
Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Illusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it, c'mon
[Hook]
About to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911
Verse - [Ganxsta Ridd]
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these - imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding a - gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 
8 Mile
 mission with Cypress and O.G.'s
[Hook]
About to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the Aks gettin sprayed cause
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911

Weed lacer
'97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary
Had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I'm on some Loc shit
Some fed up wit the 'being broke' shit
I'm not to joke with
Bitch, I don't sell crack
I smoke it
Having a coke fit and going through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my baby daughter Hailey
My brains dusted
I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets
Empty medicine cabinets
Losing battles to wack rappers because I'm always too blunted
Walking up in the cypher smoking
Talking about, "Who want it"
Thug and a crook
Every drug in the book
I've done it
My 9's at your brain
Is that your chain
Run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavour
Aggressive nature's got me sticking you for your progressive pager
Spectacular
Battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mama's Acura
Wrecked it and sold it back to her
Cruise in Nike jackets
Escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me
"I might be back quick"
So barricade your entrance
Put up some extra fences
A woman beater
Wanted for repeated sex offences
Chasing dips
Take them on long vacation trips
Kidnapping them and trapping them in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Got you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama don't you cry
Your son's too far gone
I'm so high
I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up
I feel just like an overworked plumber
I'm sick of the crap
What's Jack Kevorkian's phone number

[Produced by Bass Brothers]
[Intro]
Baby, your da-da loves you
And I'mma always be here for you no matter what happens
You're all I got in this world
I would never give you up for nothin
Nobody in this world is ever gonna keep you from me
I love you
[Verse 1]
C'mon Hai-Hai, we going to the beach
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat
Oh where's mama? She's taking a little nap in the trunk
Oh that smell? Da-da musta runned over a skunk
Now I know what you're thinking - it's kind of late to go swimming
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women
That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way,
 
she'll throw a fit
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it
 
(no!)
And don't look so upset, why you acting bashful?
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle? (yeah!)
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was 
Dinner while you were sweeping and spilled ketchup on her shirt
Mama's messy isn't she? We'll let her wash off in the water
And me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?
[Hook]
Just the two of us, just the two of us
And when we ride!
Just the two of us, just the two of us
Just you and I!
[Verse 2]
See honey: there's a place called "heaven" and a place called "hell"
A place called "prison" and a place called "jail"
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson
And you don't want a brother do ya? (Nahhh)
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better
I'll explain it to ya
But for now, we'll just say mama was real, real bad
She was being mean to dad and made him real, real mad
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out
Sit back in your chair honey, quit trying to climb out!
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba?
Take a night-night? Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?
Her make poo-poo ca-ca? Da-da change your didee
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water
'97 Bonnie and Clyde: me and my daughter
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Wake up, sweepyhead we're here, before we pway
We're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea
Mama's too sleepy to hear you screaming in her ear
 (ma-maa!)
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? (yeah!)
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free
One, two, free, whee! (woosh!)
There goes mama, splashing in the water
No more fighting with dad, no more restraining order
No more step-da-da, no more new brother
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you wuv her (mommy!)
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk
[Outro]
Just me and you baby
Is all we need in this world
Just me and you
Your da-da will always be there for you
Your da-da's always gonna love you
Remember that: if you ever need me I will always be here for you
If you ever need anything, just ask
Da-da will be right there
Your da-da loves you
I love you, baby

Intro: [Claret Jai]
The poor stays poor, the rich get richer
It’s just so disproportionate
(Get outta here)
[Hook: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That’s why I don’t give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It’s just so disproportionate
You don’t know just what I’ve gone through
That’s why I would rather show you
Just how far that I can take it
Every rule, I’m breakin’ it
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Tear-able, but not rip-able,
 
invincible, I hung invisible
Fuckin’ 
mistletoe over the world, then stuck my ass up under it
Now pucker up them lips and kiss it ho
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this’ll go
The competition’s miserable,
 
we stomp them bitches this is no, joke
Goin’ overboard like someone threw us off the boat, choke
Cough from all the smoke, I’m tryna stay on fire
So you know if I hate fucking water sprinklers, I don’t love the hose
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it’s time to stuff his face
Back in that bitch, smother that little motherfucker ’til it suffocates
You had long enough of a wait
Why are they tryin’ to be so secretive when Bad and Evil has reunited, hey
Came back to annihilate the game’s in dire straights as I await
Word on Satan as I drop fall to my knees before this Ouija board
And I pray now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I’m sleepin’ now, imagine if I awake
I’m champ bitch, I’ll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy, so you can’t squish
Nowhere near a toosh,
 
in fact if I jump out a bush
In a sneak attack’s the only way I say I am-Bush
Outlandish, these words are weapons that are brandish, standoffish
To hoes, keep your hands off this
Can’t top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for
Law? Fuck protocol, holla at this ho, but now my throat is sore
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Royce]
Baby I’m lawless, you couldn’t burn me if you threw acid on me
I’m atchu homie, I’m at your home ready to spray you while you nappin’ homie
Have everything on and around your mattress looking like the word in front of a matrimony
You high, thug yeah go ‘head jump
No matter how high you get, you gon’ come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI’s get waived by saying bye
Still ridin’ with no L’s like James Todd
Can’t change I, I thank God for my safe thinking
Last time I was safe thinking, me and my niggas was doin’ a bank job
I stay violent, y’all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye
I’ll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I’m just nice with mine
And this just rap,
 
I’m like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell ‘em left to right, head or gut
What y’all messing with is a nigga that’ll leave you FUBAR
Fucked up beyond all recognition
Y’all are rock stars, I’m the opposite
I could just throw a rock and hit a star for the fuck of it
Partner, you’re not hard, I body your hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right like Allahu Akbar
Let’s go, when I leave y’all shot, you ain’t gon’ be on your Metro
In a bad area that call dropped
[Hook]

[Hook: Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars?
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Yeah yo, let's pretend like it's '98
Like I'm eatin' lunch off of Styrofoam trays
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A (A-Town)
Hoping for a record deal to ignore my pain
Yeah, now let's pretend like I'm on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane
Okay, and everybody know my name (Bob)
And everywhere I go people want to hear me sang
Oh yeah, and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring, and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And let's pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Let's try to use imagination
[Hook]
[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Okay, let's pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didn't write raps up in all of my classes
Like I never used to run away into the blackness
Now, let's pretend like it was all good
Like I didn't live staring in the notebook
Like I did the things that I probably knew I should
But I ain't have neighbors, that's why they call it hood
Yo, now let's pretend like I ain't got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or A.K.A. Bobby Ray
I'm talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos
 
and the deals and the fame
Before they ever once compared me to Andre (3000)
Before I ever got on MySpace
Before they ever noticed my face
So let's just pretend, and make wishes out of airplanes
[Hook]
[Bridge: B.o.B. & Eminem]
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone, they're just memories
And it seems like yesterday, it was just a dream
But those days are gone
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things would've been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind
, 
"Marshall you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game, there ain't no way that you'll win"
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changing again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums
 
and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
"You won't amount to shit, quit daydreaming kid
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic"
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didn't make it to the Rap Olympics
Slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to
 
Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap so he ain't even here, he pretends that
[Hook]

[Hook: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon a
s the
y saw me
Goodnight, it's over with
That's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new I’ve seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with
That's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it’s over with
That's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with
That's all she wrote
[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin' that
I’m sewin' up the game, destroying life; they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they was this hot
Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I’m the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone,
 high-steppin' Prime Time
Thought you niggas been knowin', ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezy’s, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life,
 
you check to check recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate
Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind
[Hook: T.I.]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now Tip told me on this ho tip
Best tip I could give you to hit you
Never let these trick's trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love this slut, shit
Dig you ho, take this shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns
Like double-stick, it's you
But fuck it, Tip, it's cool
I'm chillin' like a villain
Like the penguin
 
in his fuckin' igloo eatin' fudge-scicles
I'd rather slip and fall in shit and fall in love with you
Before I tie a fuckin' knot I'd tie you in one bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game
How fuckin' dumb is you
I'll give you some mumps before I split some lump sums with you
So here's a penny for your thoughts
But it won't buy you a cheeseburger
But a nickel might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
There's a bombshell, 
scud missile
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin' cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin' stud, slut
This will teach you not to come drunk, stumblin' my way
Fo' shizzle
I still live like a budget of
 
Gilbert's
 Live check-stub, bizzle
So fuck sentences, this chick will bust like a blood vessel
[Hook: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know ‘em
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over that's all she wrote
[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit rollin', curtains closin', movie over with
But don’t get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch, but she know I’m rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah ha, I’m paid never gon' be poor again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah I’m on another level, but you niggas still can get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish
Sorry bro this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it Tip
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
I'mma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock I'm racing it, double timing it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-Mart like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the F on dawg
[Hook: T.I. & Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Goodnight is over with that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
I said its over with
That's all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight it’s over with that's all she wrote
[Verse 5: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a Slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed, wait Sarah you're late
Your train left Mascara and eggs smeared in your face
Night's over, good bye ho I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never should've came within range of my rover
Should've known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola, Faygo's cheaper
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch?
You're already bi-polar
[Hook: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know as soon as they saw me
It's never me to get the privilege to know ‘em
I roll like a desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over that's all she wrote
[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King
They were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang
I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why

[Hook]
You dream of trading places,
 
I have been changing faces
You cannot fill these shoes,
 
there is too much to lose
Wake up behind these trenches, you run around defenseless
There is too much to lose, You cannot fill these shoes
I just want to be famous...but
Be careful what you wish for
[Verse 1]
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go bezerker than a fed up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg
I'm pissed off
 
get murdered
Like someone took a ketchup squirter
Squirted a frankfurter
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving
Like a terrible towel
How thangs turn around
When his fangs come out
Get your brains blown out
That's what I call 
blowing your mind
When I come back
Like nut on your spine
I'm a thumb tack
That you slept on son
Now here I come screaming "Attack!"
Like I just stepped on one
Low on the totem til he showed 'em
Defiance, giant scrotum
He don't owe them bitches shit
His britches, he out grow'd em
He's so out cold he's knocked out of the South Pole
And nobody fucks with him
Rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dying of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em
Then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort em
Shit stained drawers
You gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I'm back for revenge
I lost a battle that ain't happening again
I'm at your throat like strep
I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand
Some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin
I do what I have to to win
Pulling out all stops, 
any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
And tell that psycho to pass the torch
To the wacko before I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern
And smash it on his porch
Now get off my dick
Dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick
Don't call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
You're the Eminem backwards, you're Mini Me
See he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs; you're BB's, you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it; you were dissing his CD's
Laughed at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Now there he goes in Dre's studio cupping his balls
Screaming the wood off the panel
And cussing the paint off the walls
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, til Abraham Lincoln is screaming out AHH
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die
And eat shit while they at it
He's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world
So go to hell and build a snowman, girl
The bullies become bullied,
 the pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, 
take me back to 9th grade to school me
Cause I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing
Who could've known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it
And while I'm being poetic let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women has been lowered
So bear witness to some biblical shit
As a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous

[Verse 1: Slim Shady]
I'm the devil, if ever there was such a thing
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis-(gu-uh-uh)-sting
I'm (what), a human mutt fuck a being
I'm a dog
 - 
fuck lambs, I'm silencing 'em all
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor
Each thought's completely warped
I'm like a walking, talking, 
Ouija board
Speaking in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before
Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norrf
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em
'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?
Well if so, get ready for some shit
, yo
"Is this some kind of sick joke?" Shit no, motherfucking schizo
So disturbed, 
he just goes so berserk,
 he tiptoes
Fist first with scissors to slit throats of just hoes
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with
So-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp
So - lock your doors, drop to the floors
Get your shotguns drawn
 - here comes another "
Clockwork Orange
"
Look at Bizarre; you really think he's right in his mind
What the fuck you think's goin' through when he's writin' his rhyme
[Hook: Slim Shady]
You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his silent screams
You bout to - journey into the mind of a psychopath killer
Blood spiller, mentality much iller
Than you could ever imagine in your wildest dreams
You'll feel his pain and his violent screams
[Verse 2: Peter S. Bizarre]
It's Friday night, I'm at a rave again
Picking up transvestites on my
 
Harley-Davidson
 (hey hop on)
My girlfriend's a crackhead whore
She'll come to your door, suck your dick on the floor
And take your bottles to the store (nigga, I'm takin these)
Have you ever seen a bitch get beat because she won't cheat
Run the street and suck another nigga's meat?
My son's sixteen years old with nowhere to stay (dad it's me)
I told him he wasn't mine, slammed the door in his face
And I ain't got no food, my job I've been cheated
My girlfriend had a miscarriage (I'm sorry) I had to eat it (ohh)
My dick is burning, it ain't cause of disease
Because I'm jacking off with gasoline mixed with antifreeze (AHH!)
I'm living in Waco Texas
, me and my girl
Fuck 
David Koresh
, I'm starting my own world
It's called Bizarre Cemetery, it's scary
Eating a virgin's cherry,
 
then I'm gonna laugh at you Carrie
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I was born feet first, smoke 40's and drink weed
The Lord rehearsed my birth,
 I'm the worst breed
A nigga you ever set sight on, 
my right arm's
Got more power than 5 of Ivan Drago's pythons so
"Journey into the mind of a psychopath killer"
Light yo' ass like a liquid nitro-gas spiller
Psycho slash Michael Myers
, 
Michael Jack's "Thriller"
Rifle slash knife faggot that's your
 "
Cop Killer
"
As a yung'un, I was beat where I was living
 (aight)
Cross-dressed just to get thrown in the women's prison
I guess I was just stressed to be a hoodlum
Being pressed caused the stress that caused the Ritalin
Pressed stressed and Ritalin caused the cop's feelings
To be hurt after they seen what I did to those children
I'm vulgaric, you 
Bo Derek
; I throw you face flat off the terrace
So you can have somethin' to stare at
[Hook]

[Hook]
Mentally ill from
 
Amityville
 (he'll)
Accidentally kill your family still
Thinking he won't, goddammit he will (he's)
Mentally ill from Amityville (he's)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick (SMACK)
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers
Hash, whiskey, and ash til I slap bitches
Ask Bizzy
 
he's been here the past six years
Mash with me again and imagine this
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I fucked my cousin in his asshole, slit my mother's throat
Guess who Slim Shady just signed to Interscope
My little sister's birthday, she'll remember me
For a gift I had ten of my boys take her virginity
And bitches know me as a horny-ass freak
Their mother wasn't raped, I ate her pussy while she was asleep
Pissy-drunk, throwing up in the urinal
 
(you fucking homo)
That's what I said at my dad's funeral
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fucking idiots still
That's why the first motherfucker popping some shit he gets killed
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville
You can get capped after just having a cavity filled
Ahahahaha, that's why we're crowned the murder capital still
This ain't Detroit, this is motherfucking Hamburger Hill
We don't do drive-bys, we park in front of houses and shoot
And when the police come we fucking shoot it out with them too
That's the mentality here, that's the reality here
Did I just hear somebody say they want to challenge me here
While I'm holding a pistol with this many calibers here
Plus a registration that just made this shit valid this year
Cause once I snap, I can't be held accountable for my actions
And that's when accidents happen
When a thousand bullets come at your house
And collapse the foundation around and they found you
And your family in it
GOD DAMMIT HE MEANT IT WHEN HE TELLS YOU
[Hook]

[Intro]
Alright, let's go

What we call this shit right here
[Eminem]
The invasion
You have 
part one
 u got 
part two

Part three
The final chapter mother fuckers
Armageddon, lets go
[Hook]
I got a riddle what's little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white fillin' in the middle
That will do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walkin' the whole Mediterranean
Isn't it Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tasmanian no
His name's Raymond
 
and oh, oh sorry yo so sorry wow
But that was a long time ago when I was just Joe Shmoe
Rappin' in Joe Blows basement I apologized for it befo', so
Either except it or you don't and lets move on
If I've shown that I've grown
 
and get the bone
Keep lickin' these nuts you industry mutts
Keep walkin' around sniffin' each others butts
Or should I say asses
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses
[
]
Hold up hold up hold up
New york city man
It's the kid Lloyd Banks
And if you hearin' what I'm hearin' right now
You know this ain't no regular shit homy
This something special and we gotta bring this back
Green come on
Countdown to
[Eminem]
Armageddon
Lets go
[Hook]
[Verse 1:]
The question I ask is
How can I explain this
How can I swing this in English language
If I switch to slang and turn man to man
Do I do it in vain or simply to entertain
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this 
 wody on my daughter
I told ya I love this culture don't let em' insult ya
I'm tell ya one me (a)gain this is the environment that I was brought up in
But every now and then I use my pen to get rid of some frustration
Or should I say or should I say shun
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism
Your face is numb your stunned your look is cold
Like that of a man of seventy some years old
And it only gets colder which Is why I understand
And can't be mad at a
 
forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder who only owns a half of a magazine
And the only way to have it seen is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin is to see me frown
Papa can't stand me papa needs to take his medication and sit the fuck down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell Apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buyin' two white guys disguised as pro black
There is no slack
Far heart for college grad. In a fitted hat and a hunch back
Standin' by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and tomorrows old throw backs
Yeah
[Outro:]
Shady in the place to be c
And it takes what I got to rock the mic 
right
Still not gonna cater these punks
Fuckin' cocksuckin' pussy lips haters dicks cunts

[Verse 1]
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfilling
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speaking to children
Everything was happening so fast,
 
it was like I blinked – sold three million
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin' ridiculous cause I was getting sick of this feelin'
Like I am always under attack, man, I could have stacked my shit list to the ceiling
Women dishin'
 
but really thinking if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite
 
when I'm rippin' shit
But since when did this many
People ever give a shit what I had to say,
 
it's just my opinion
If it contradicts how I'm living,
 
put a dick in your rear end
That's why every time you mentioned a lyric, I thanked you for it
For drawing more attention toward it
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect
 
and battle for it
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed
 
atta-boy
They told me to slow down, and I just zone out
Good luck trying to convince a blonde,
 
it's like telling Gwen Stefani that she sold out
Cause I was trying to leave, No Doubt
In anyone's mind one day I'd go down in history think they know now
Cause everybody knows
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Everybody knows that you're just an asshole
Everywhere that you go, people wanna go home, everyone knows
Everybody knows, so don't pretend to be nice
There's no place you can hide
You are just an asshole
Everyone knows, everyone knows
[Bridge]
Thanks for the support, asshole *scratch*
Thanks for the support, asshole
[Verse 2]
Quit actin' salty,
 
I was countin' on you to count me out
Ask Asher Roth when he round about dissed me to shout me out
Thought I was history,
 
but goddamn honky, that compliment's like backhanding a donkey, good way to get your ass socked in the mouth
Nah, I'm off him, but what the fuck is all this trash talking about?
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me,
 
you knocked me down
I went down for the count,
 
I fell, but the fans caught me and now
You're gonna have to beat the fucking pants off me to take my belt
Word to Pacquiao,
 
momma said there ain't nothing else to talk about
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out,
 
or you better not come out
It's poetry in motion,
 
like Freddie Roach when he's quoting
Shakespeare,
 
so what if the insults are revolting
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet riddled,
 
but you should give little shit what I think
This whole world is a mess, gotta have a goddamn
Vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman
Who needs to test a testicles? Not that man
Half of you don't got the guts and intestinal blockage,
 
rest of you got lap bands
Stuck to this motto
 
before they put bath salts and all those water bottles in Colorado
So get lost, Waldo,
 
my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping
A black hole and I'm swallowing this track whole
 
better pack toilet paper
But I'm taking no crap, ho, here I go down the Bat Pole
And I'm changing back into that old maniac in fact there they go
Trying to dip out the back door retreating
Cause everybody knows
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Holy mackerel, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth,
 
I smacked a girl
Off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull
For thinking we had some magnetic pull
Then screamed "ICP in this bitch! How do fucking magnets work?"
Cause you're attractive, but we ain't attractable
Hate to be dramatical, but I'm not romantical
I'm making up words you can understandable
It's tragical
Thinking some magical shit's gonna happen?
 
That ain't practical
You cracking a joke, it's laughable
Cause me and love's like a bad combination,
 
I keep them feelings locked in a vault so it's safe to say I'm uncrackable
My heart is truly guarded
Full body armor,
 
bitch, you just need a helmet cause if you think you're special, you're retarded
Thinking you're one of a kind, like you got some platinum vagina
You're a train wreck, I got a one-track mind;
 
shorty, you're fine but you sort of remind me of a 49er
Cause you been a gold digger since you was a miner
Been tryna hunt me down like a dog, cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent
Cause all of my spare time is spent
On my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin'
Only women that I love are my daughters,
 
but sometimes I rhyme
And it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther,
 
so Father forgive me if I forget to draw the line
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent,
 
I'll never grow up, so to hell with your parents And 'mother' fucking 'father' time
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who transformed to an optimist in his prime
So even if I'm half dead, I'm half alive
Poured my half empty glass in a cup, so now my cup has runneth over
And I'm bout to set it on you like a muthafucking coaster
I’m going back to what got me here, yeah cocky
And can’t knock being rude off, so fear not my dear
And dry up your teardrops I'm here
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird
If you stare at me and see yourself, because you're one too
Shouldn't be a shock, because everybody knows–

[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an ass like that
The way you move it,
 
you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
I don't believe it, it's almost too good to be true
I ain't never seen a ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing doing doing
[Verse 1]
The way she moves, she's like a belly-dancer
She's shaking that ass to the new Nelly jams
I think someone's at the door but I don't think I'mma answer
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'?
 
Please, I'm a human being!
I have needs! I'm NOT done, not 'til I'm finished peeing
I am not resisting arrest, I am agreeing
Mr. Officer! I'm already on my knees
I can't get on the ground any further, it's impossible for me
And do not treat me like a murderer
, 
I just like to pee
Pee, pee, yes, I make R&B, I sing song
It go Ring-a-Chong, a-Ching-Chong-Chong-Chong-Ching
Psych! I joke, I joke! I keed, I keed!
If I offend, I'm sorry! Please, please, forgive!
For I am Triumph the Puppet Dog, I am a mere puppet
I can get away with anything I say and you will love it!
[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing doing doing
Jessica Simpson looks oh so tempting
Nick, I ain't never seen a ass like that
Everytime I see that show on MTV
, 
my pee-pee goes
Doing doing doing
[Verse 2]
Mary-Kate and Ashley used to be so wholesome
Now they getting older, they're starting to grow bum-bums
I go to the movies and sit down with my popcorn
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'?
 
Geez, I just got my seat!
I have ticket, look
, 
I put it away, my zipper's zipped!
Please do not remove me from this movie theatre, please
I did not even get to see Mary Kate's shower scene
I didn't mean to be obscene or make a great big scene
And don't treat me like I'm Pee Wee Herman, this movie's PG
Mr. Officer, I demand to see my attorney
I will simple plead innocent, cop a plea, and be free
Free, yes free, right back on the streets
What you mean my lawyer's with Michael, he's too busy?
I am Triumph, Britney Spears has shoulders like a man
And I can say that and you'll laugh
Cause there's a puppet on my hand
[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
Hilary Duff is not quite old enough
, so
I ain't never seen her butt like that
Maybe next year, I'll say ass and she'll make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
[Verse 3]
The way she moves, she dances like a go-go
In that video, she sings, "Get out, you bozo
I need a new boyfriend!" Hi, my name is JoJo
Police saying 'freeze!': doing, doing, doing
What do you mean, 'freeze'?
 
My computers will be seized
And my keys, to my ranch
, 
I just bake cookies
Mr. Officer, lookie, take a whiff of this
Here, I make Jesus juice, take a sip of this
Nobody is safe from me! No, not even me
I don't even know if I can say the word 'pee-pee'
Pee, on the radio but I think I did
Janet, is that a breast? I think I just saw a tit!
Psych! I joke, I joke, 
I keed, I keed
I don't think my joke is working, I must flee quick!
Get to the chopper, everybody get out
I am not Triumph, I am Ah-nuld, get dowwwn!
[Hook]
The way you shake it, I can't believe it
I ain't never seen an - ass like that
The way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
So Gwen Stefani, will you pee-pee on me please
I ain't never seen a - ass like that
Cause the way you move it, you make my pee-pee go
Doing, doing, doing
[Dr. Dre] 
THE FUCK IS WRONG WITCHU?
[Eminem] 
HA!!

[Hook]
I don't know why this world keep turning round and round
But I wish it would stop and let me off right now
[Interlude]
Yes man, as the world turns, we all experience things in life
Trials and tribulations that we all must go through
When someone wants to test us, when someone tries our patience
[Verse 1]
I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in 
They never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
'til they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman,
 
dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this bitch in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, bitch you so big
You walked into Vic Tanny's
 
and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Grabbed that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down
Sorry coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop
[Hook]
[Interlude]
As the world turns, these are the days of our lives
These are the things that we must go through, day by day
[Verse 2]
We drive around in million dollar sports cars
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards
Outsidaz, and we suing the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in 
Hypochondriac, hanging out at the laundromat
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at
Dressed like a sailor, standin' by a pail of garbage
It's almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch
I met a slut and said "What up? It's nice to meet ya
I'd like to treat you to a Faygo and a slice of pizza
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid 'til the first of next month
But if you would care to join me, I was about to roll this next blunt
But I ain't got no weed, no Phillies, or no papers
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist
So give me all your money and don't try nothing funny
Cause you know your stinking ass is too fat to try to outrun me"
I went to grab my gun, that's when her ass put it on me
With an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry
I fell through the glass doors, started causing a scene
Slid across the floor and flew right into a washing machine
Jumped up with a broken back
Thank God I was smokin' crack all day and doped up on coke and smack
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse
Now I wanna kill her but yo, I gotta catch her first
Ran through Rally's parkin' lot and took a shortcut
Saw the house she ran up in and shot her fuckin' porch up
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut
Looked around the room that's when I seen her bedroom door shut
I know you're in there bitch, I got my gun cocked
You might as well come out now, 
she said "Come in, it's unlocked"
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin' gay porn
She said "Come here big boy, let's get acquainted"
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it
She came at me at full speed, nothing could stop her
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her
I started to beg "No, please let go"
But she swallowed my fuckin' leg whole like an egg roll
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple
Just tryna buy me some time then I remembered this magic trick
Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget dick!
Whipped that shit out, and ain't no doubt about it
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage
I shouted, now bitch, let's see who gets the best
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death
(Come here bitch, come here, take this mothafuckin' dick bitch, come here)
[Hook]
[Interlude]
And as we go along, throughout the days of our lives
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday
That we must go through, these are the things
That surround us through our atmosphere, every day
Every single day the world keeps turning

[Hook: Eminem]
The lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum
I said the lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum
[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
I walk around with OJ's glove knowing it fit
Fif to the toilet we taking over this shit
The Yaowa waited, salivated like man I know I can spit
I was knocking for quite some time but you wouldn't open this bitch
You turn green when I enter,
 
probably can't breathe
Now ya'll trees in the winter, nobody can't leave
For all those that was doubtful I got a scalpel
And a mouthful of vowels to make a party stampede
You brag about swag and your feminine trends
I belittle your riddle you Skittles with Eminem's friends
So I ain't trying to play with you, this chainsaw crack jokes
On Cain's brother brah, disable you
I'm an untamable animal with aim from a moving train
I could graze your decaying tooth
And my straight jacket just came unloose
I'm reporting live this is (BREAKING NEWS!)
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Psycho, like no, bitch made, nigga so
This grave, digga go, insane
I got the switchblade to your throat, move it's not smart
I'll slice and watch you bleed all over the pop charts
Me and the Slaughters run the asylum,
 
I'm feeling
Like DiCaprio rapping on Shutter Island
This industry is pussy
, 
guess who's gonna hit it the meanest
Give her the penis, hit the bitch in her Venus
To this game I'm addicted and fiendish,
 I'm predicted to bring this
G shit to it's pinnacle zenith, lyrical genius
So sick with ridiculous English, niggas get squeamish
When they hear this criminal linguist
Fall back it's the take over, ya'll wack and ya cake over
I escape from the padded room
, 
grab a broom and rape a male rapper's womb
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9]
I've witnessed the worst happening
The hurt moment when I'm purse snatching
I'm perp going
 
berserk boning Miss nurse Ratchet
When we spit you get the pug face
Your bitch swallowed my five dollar foot long on the subway
If sane people are rich why should I sit around?
Play me and end up like the back of this hospital gown, ass out
Drink drink drink drink, pass out
Ya'll feel me right?
When I was young I was loud, I used to be like "I'LL KILL YA!"
Now I be like "You know I'll kill ya right?"
If ya'll don't like it ya'll can lick my dick
Cause we built this house we live in brick by brick
[Hook]

[Hook: Stat Quo]
I'm the next one next one
Motherfuckers can't fuck with me with me
Got a problem shorty come get me
Nah, I ain't Dr. Dre, nah, I ain't Eminem or 50, dog I’m Stat
[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
As I think back, retract, from the classroom to the trap
Freida's only son had to hustle for scraps
It's hard to relax when your wage minimum, bein' broke
Fuck, with my adrenaline before Dre and Eminem
I was trying to get on demo tapes state to state
Performing at clubs and doing whatever it takes
Relying on faith hopin' my dreams take shape
And my fate meeting (?)
I would wait for these A&R’s
 
say I ain’t grind bitch
Spendin' my last dime on this studio time shit
A lot of folk told me I was stupid for trying this
Situation crucial feds off in my climate
Home environment taking pictures of me it was ugly
The spot got hot, scene felt like curry
Had my vision blurry to underground Atlanta
Hit the streets me and Zeke put a plan together
Shorty it's now or never down to do whatever
You see the rainfall came but I had to bear that weather
Look your boy need cheddar like a mill or better
I was fed up but the benefit was worth the effort
[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I'm patiently waitin'
, used to get love
Now the same niggas hatin', wanna give me slugs
Partner don't get it separated or twisted, you can't fade it
Stat's the wrong motherfucker to play with, understand me
[Bridge: Eminem]
If you opened up your ears long enough to listen
You may hear what you've been missin' out all of this time
I've been put in a position to put all this in position
So quit your bitchin', learn how to rhyme
Get signed and get your shine
[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like this and like that and, uh, welcome to Statlanta
Shady Aftermath and, uh, a brand new rapper from Atlanta
Who goes by the name of Stat Quo
Introducing our new excuse to keep producin'
Continue to do music, use it and expand it and make rap grow
The hottest new shit on the planet, on a new plateau
But don't confuse it, you don't understand it
Let me break it down for you to show you how we do shit
So that you cats know, this is Statlanta 101
Cause we don't want no one walking out this motherfucker with tunnel vision
So anyone with questions you want answered
Just ask and we'll try to unmask them and maybe explain why so few cats blow
Just spit the truth when you get in this booth
 and do that though
That there boy hot to death
, you already knew that though
Is he the greatest from the ATL,
 
we got haters all day to debate us
So we'll just say this: he's one of them not to tackle
[Bridge: Stat Quo]
I got caviar wishes, box Chevy dreams
CD covers, TV screens
The booth or the block, might go to triple beam
I'mma make it right, hear me, huh huh huh
Fuck what your saying, God put me here to shine
Going on tour or white collar crime
The rhyme or the grind, MPC or the nine
I'mma make it, I need mine, huh huh huh
[Verse 3: Stat Quo]
I can care less, fuck yall, you don't make or break me
Real niggas love me, pussy niggas hate me
Down bitches ride for Stat Quo, they know
The A-Town D Young County be trill folk
Didn't no other label offer me no deal
Till they found out Shady/Aftermath was interested
Then they started to beg, want the truth, there it is
This ain't a gimmick, this the south and I be that kid
Just ride through watching lines of his rhymes
In time you're going to find you're on a great trip
Ain't a word I could life be some extraordinary shit
The piece of the puzzle that fit, it's Stat Quo, you son of a bitch
[Refrain]

[Verse 1]
Ayo I'm focused, it's the locust
O. Trice is holding the soldiers, the prognosis
Probably why I rose from zero to hope
Cause I was wide eyed and open nosed on my approach
Nigga, hold the toast you provoke
44 Snub hugs my scrotum when I roll
Yes I hold my own, Swifty think you Deebo's clone
I'm aimin, watch I'm switchin to Damon
And Next Friday I can bet you's a changed man
When them thangs in hand, it's not a game man
I ghost ya, I bring ya much closer to Jehovah
Definition of a soldier, I told ya
I, 
hold the toast
 when I approach
It's close at all times by my side in the holster
O-ster roast ya
, 
make me blow my composure
Pop, it's all over, when the 44 blows and goes a..
[Hook]
When I'm up in the club and these niggas, they wanna act tough
'til they get plugged, watch them bullets go...
Now you touched from a slug, huggin the streets like you in love
Your heart rate's like...
The ambulance arrive
They rush you to the 'spital, flyin by my ride, engine like...
Homie you just died, your family through crying
I pulled off a crime, just as quick as...
[Verse 2]
You could lose your face, in a fool's race
I pulled my tool first nigga, you was in second place
And second place just means you didn't react with haste
And this differentiates life where murder being the case
And since murder was the case
, it just means niggas erase
Another black mother can't eat the food on her plate
Cause she ain't got the taste as if raising you was a waste
"Such a short span young man" said at your wake
First I'm a man, second I'm five eight
But size and weight won't give a nigga the upper hand
Cause when I pop, I give this up like Barry Sand
Sit in the can, 
he never ran like Barry Sand
Obie ain't playin, Obie got a plan
And the plan is not to be layin in earth's land
I will pop before the can and earth's land
You get shot for playin me less than a man, mothafucka
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Niggas get it twisted, liquor make 'em envision
That gangsterism is disrespecting a niggas wishes
Which is all that tough talk in front of bitches
Yeah you fifteen deep, the Desert E'll give ya stitches
And I can be all the bitches and hoes you wanna
But I warn ya the Glock could make it hot as California
You be popped on the corner, flesh meeting the coroner
O's in quarantine, cause no holes in me
An' since no holes in me, niggas take advantage
'til I manage to pull that hammer out,
 
they start scattering
I'm no gangster, I'm a average man
But be damned if I let 'em do me savage man
Before that I'm strapped and will challenge him
Cock back and that gat will damage them
It's not a act, this is fact, this is how I'm programmed
This is me, what I'm about, this who I am, motherfucker
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
One thousand different houses and Münchausen
Will make you wanna punch out some fucking one, ouch
What the fuck'd you hit me for,
 
scream life as I punch counter
And bunches out of anger,
 
I once encountered a stranger in a dumb gown
Black hood with a scythe, shit I laughed in his face spit
Bitch gave me an extra life, like take this
Now get your ass back in that game, bitch
Don't take shit for granted and don't take shit, give it
Only bull you should take is by the horns,
 
a mixture of Whitey Ford
And Mighty Thor, I everlast, pen is mightier than sword
Finish writing then record, replenish keep writing more
Nothing's riding on it,
 
but your pride, that's all you're fighting for
So you fight, scratch, you claw, backs to wall, no one was there
To catch you fall, you pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off
You grab your balls, like they're gargantuan
And ask yourself how fucking bad you want it
Pull out your badge for whooping ass
And flash it on 'em,
 
nobody's gonna back you in the corner,
 
you're a hornet
No one's more ignorant than you fucking four in the morning
You're at the la-bor-atory,
 
storming like there's nothing that's more important
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it
Girl, what would you do if I said your body was "off the chain"
And I told you I smile "every single time I saw your face"
I ain't finished bitch, I meant "in half", oil the blades
Nobody wants to play,
 
they say I'm "a spoiled little baby", but
[Hook]
Nobody puts a baby in the corner
I'm only tryna warn ya
Cause that baby gets mad
And gets to throwing a tantrum, he'll fucking flip on ya, cause (2x)
[Verse 2]
What goes through an addict's brain?
 
Besides static pain
And Big Daddy Kane,
 
great beats and words,
 
an erratic train
Of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain yeah
Maybe that explains why you're back but you don't rap the same
And you're looking way thinner cause your hunger got you lookin'
Like they took away dinner,
 
Sugar Ray Leonard
Wouldn't sugar coat a fucking booger though
Just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat
When you say you're a
 
*Jugga, what? Jugga*
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips
Hope it lands on another rap singers lips who can't think of shit
Anything of wit that's interesting to spit
Show who's king of this fucking English lit?
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand, while extending this shit
How low can you go,
 
lower then Chuck D ho
Hear the bass of this in my voice,
 
Rocky's back, where's my Adrian
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots to rap
Not a man, I'm a weapon
Who just happened to be a rapper, who just happen to be on the crapper
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom
I'd never be the same after,
 
now I'm back with an appe-
-tite for destruction and the fuckin' recipe for disaster
So let's eat cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastardly one
Evilest bastard, even you asking for me to be po-
-lite to people is like me having my teeth pulled
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
So step inside of dementia, the demented side of a mind
That's like the inside of an engine,
 
while I multiply your undivided attention
But be reminded that if I didn't mention, I lose my mind and my temper
You'll be the first one who finds him offensive
Got him climbing the fences,
 
lost some time to addiction
But look up rhyme in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture
Eminem is the synonym for it,
 
I'm an enigma
Fuck it, let's get to the meat balls, I'm gonna skip the
Veg and potatoes,
 
edumacator
They are shit legends are made of,
 
spit treachreous data
Shit that you would say to your worst enemy
This wretched is what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman
 
with metham-
-phetamines in his left hand, in his right is a sledgehammer
In pajamas, standing in front of a webcam
Beating himself in the head, 'til Russell lets him off Def Jam
Maybe I need my head examined,
 
Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb
Hanging from his ceiling dripping with a bed pan
I need meds,
 
swear to God, cause if I go off the edge
T.I. ain't talking me off a ledge man
Heart throb that'll fart, ah, nah,
 
more like a smart slob
Part blob, that'll stab you with a sharp ob-
-ject to the heart
And leave claw marks all over the Wal-Mart walls
Little baby with large balls
Fuck mud-slinging,
 
I'm blood-flinging
There's nothing on this fucking earth better than being the king of the playground
I hate the swings, but I love being an underdog
Cause when I'm pushed, I end up swinging (ah!)
[Hook]

[Police voice]
Attention all units, attention all units
We have an 
all-points bulletin
 out on 
a man with green hair
I repeat, we have an APB on a man with green hair
He's armed with a knife, I repeat, he's armed with a knife
Proceed with caution, watch your back fellas
He could be coming at your girlfriend next
[Verse 1]
There's a joker on the loose from the psychiatric ward
His face is up on the bulletin board with a reward
He'll stab you with a sword don't be fooled by his charm
He's probably armed with intent to do bodily harm
Ring the alarm,
 
look for a man with green hair
Check at your girl's house, he was last seen there
He's has a mean stare but usually cracks jokes
Good luck on your mission and guard your backs, folks
[Hook]
[I make]? you fuckin' backstabber
(Why I oughta) beat a bitch snake from the hood, haha
[I make]? you fuckin' backstabber
(Why I oughta)
Stay away from him, he ain’t no good!
[Verse 2]
We got the walkie-talkies to keep us all informed
Suited up head to toe in detective uniforms
Our unit storms in, we split the ghetto in sectors
Locking down every block and put up metal detectors
Protect yours and be sure that you stand close
Watch each other's backs and guard your command post
And most of all be advised that he's wise
He could be disguised as one of your very own guys
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I'm on a solo mission to find him personally
To settle the score and beat then him unmercifully
For what he first did to me
It's sure to be the last
Following footprints with a magnifying glass
To drag his lying ass back to his padded cell
I'm mad as hell, on the trail of this tattle tail
I heard a yell the voice sounded familiar
"Give me your girlfriend or I'm gonna kill ya"
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
I followed the voice that led down a flight of steps
Sneezing at dust, and swinging at the spider webs
Inside the depths of his basement
I taste lint in my mouth, then the lights in the place went!
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes
I felt a butcher knife slash at one of my thighs
None of my guys knew where I'm at I was doomed
Then I remembered the flashlight in my costume
[Hook]
[Verse 5]
Dealing with backstabbers there was one thing I learned
They're only powerful when you got your back turned
I yearned for the day that we finally met again
So I can give him a taste of his own medicine
He shed his skin,
 
then he promised to come clean
I took his butcher knife
 
and jabbed it into his spleen
Cuffed him at the scene then dragged the fella home
Beating him over the head with the telephone
[Police voice]
Attention all cars, attention all cars
Unit 313 has apprehended the suspect
He's going back to the crazy home, I repeat
He's going back to the crazy home, job well done!
[Hook] x3

[Part 1: Produced by S1 and M-Phazes]
[Verse 1]
It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio
You're right back on it
 
reminding me all over again
How you fucking just brushed me off
 
and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time trying to soul search
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt
But I'm coming for closure
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
Oh, you thought it was over?
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life, like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine
Well, I've never recovered, but tonight I bet ya that what
You're 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Can I hold grudges, mind saying, "Let it go, fuck this"
Heart's saying: "I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"
[Hook: Sarah Jaffe]
I flee the scene like it was my last ride
You see right through, oh you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth but it's easier to justify
What's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
I just hate to be the bad guy
(Follow me I ruh-uh-un, follow me I ruh-uh-un)
[Verse 2]
And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit
Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sew,
 
nitwit
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it?
 
Forget it
You left our family in shambles
And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone, but he's not forgotten
And don't think cause he's been out the pictures
So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to getcha
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him, same shit you did to me; cold
Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee who better to talk to than you,
 
the cause of my problems
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
And...
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I've been driving around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Finally I found your new address, park in your drive
Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva
My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
See, it's sad it came to this point
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya
But I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology, or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential, I peeked
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch,
 
man
Door handles unlocked
Shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag
Gag, almost hack-up a lung
, 
like you picked an axe up and swung,
 
stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk
And here's your Bronco hat; you can have that shit back cause they suck
It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now,
 
wait, here comes my favorite lyric
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for publicity stunt, this should be fun
Last album now, cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much
I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear
That sirens I hear
Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
(Oh, God, police aaaghh)
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan Stan,
 
Slim "chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"
Well gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
[Part 2: Produced by StreetRunner]
[Verse 4]
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over
Here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds
Toilets clogged, yeah cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up
But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollers after the track is demolished
"I am your lack of a conscience"
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eatin' your vocal chords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water but I'm that
 
pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate
That you became with every faggot you slaughtered
Coming back on you, every woman you insult,
 
batter but the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters
I represent everything, you take for granted
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade
And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off
Sad, but it happens to all of 'em
I'm the hindsight to say, “I told you so”
Foreshadows of all the, things that are to follow
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow
If you don't stop after they call ya
Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have but, as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact, then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case
Better make sure you're packing a wallop
So one last time
I'm back,
 
before it fades into black and it's all over
 
Behold the, final chapter in a saga
Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Twice, the magic that started
It all,
 
tragic portrait of an artist tortured trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker
Than anything imaginable,
 
here goes a wild stab in the dark, uh
As we (I) pick up where the last Mathers left off

Hi!
Original 
Bad Boy
 
on the case
, cover your face
Came in the place blowed
, 
and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smellin'
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
With a capital,
 
somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple (hurry up!)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I'm for sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!)
Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it
[Hook]
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fuckin crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand, a bottle of pain pills and a minithin
Is fuckin crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fuckin crazy
[Verse 2]
I'm ice grillin you
, 
starin you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head
, spazmatic
Strapped to a Craftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, 
IV full of Thai weed
Lookin Chinese
, 
with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins
, 
joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins --
 it probably all depends
On if I keep on killin my girlfriends
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Last night 
I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in at work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3 and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
,
Give me eleven Excedrin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" "Forget it then"
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
And 
pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
"Somethin somethin somethin, somethin, I get weeded"
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn!

Bust it
The final problem is solved by throwin' sulfuric acid all over your back to see your spinal column dissolve
Droppin' bodies like it was domino season
My phenomenal legion
 will shoot out your fuckin' abdominal region
Slim Shady, responsible for your permanent stillness
Just escaped from the hospital with terminal illness
Itchin' to rip your fuckin' frame out
Cuz I ain't got nothing to lose like that movie that just came out
Callin' your name out, first, last and your middle initial
Your mom, your dad, and your pregnant widow will miss you
And anybody else poppin' some shit'll go witchu
Cuz I ain't tryna hear it like a political issue
So until I can leave with enough funds
I'mma shove guns up in the mouths of your loved ones
Drown 'em face down in the bath while the tub runs
Got a rap sheet that's longer than Tubby's sub buns
And I'mma kill it, so y'all think that I can come of the top
And I be forced to rock unorthodox styles from off the top of the dome
With a popular poem, Forget a damn team I can stop you alone
Rapper's thinking they putting out they records cause they sell
But that can't fuck with what me, we doing here with AL
Y'all don't wanna do it, when we kick it, when we kick the fluid
Rappers don't wanna get into it, Y'all knew it
Cause the feds want me, they headhunt me, I'm Ted Bundy
I ain't dead, I just fled country
Said bluntly, a cannibal animal, fed monthly
Eating bread crunchy, cement bed's comfy
Head's lumpy, funky like a dead skunk be
Med flunkie, jump off cliffs with thread bungee
Wearing red undees and a black cape
Rollin' through the hood cracked out bumping' your wack tape
I'm coming through dumpin'
Change your rap name to Richard Jewell, cause you ain't blowing up nothing
I'm showing up puffin', throwing up drinkin'
Killing brain cells till I'm slowing up thinking
Growing up stinkin', born with bad odor
Gimme Hennessey but please don't add soda
Now who's doper? You couldn't beat me when I'm sober
I'm off my fuckin' rocker like your Grandma tipping over, Slim Shady
"Son, where you from son?"
"Yo, I'm from Detroit city"
"Uh huh"
"I'm bout to do a little something like this. A little something like this."
"Ok, drop that shit."
"Bust it, bust it"
Yo, I hang with a bunch of hippies and wacky tobacco planters
Who swallow lit roaches and light up like jack-o-lanterns
Outsidaz baby, and we suin' the courts
Cause we dope as fuck and only get a two in the Source
Yo, they never shoulda booted me outta reform school
Deformed fool, taking a shit in a warm pool
Till they threw me out the Ramada Inn
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin (Oh my God, it's you! Not again!)
It all started when my mother took my bike away
Cause I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave
After that, it was straight to the forty ouncers
Slappin' teachers and jackin' off in front of my counselors
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman
Fuck the next lesson, I'll pass the test guessin'
And all the other kids said "Eminem is a thizz head
He'll never last, the only class he'll ever pass is phys-ed"
Maybe true, 'til I told this girl in gym class
That she was too fat to swim laps she need a Slim Fast
(Who? Me?) Yeah, girl you so big
You stepped, walked into Vic Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig
Put me in a headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig
I felt the evilness and started transformin'
It began stormin', I heard a bunch of cheerin' fans swarmin'
Picked that bitch by her hair, drug her across the ground
And threw her up to the highest diving board to toss her down
Sorry Coach, it's too late to tell me stop
While I drop this girl face down and watch her belly flop,
 cause it's like that
And I come in and I start wildin' and shit
Then I be busting a lyric and rappers don't believe I'm freestyling it
Well here it goes when I'm kicking lyrical flows
From your head to your toes, so that every rapper in this place knows
Cause when it comes to the freestyle coming off of the top of the dome
I'm knocking your mouth and ya off, so who you copying off?
Stop being soft, I'm standing on top of your loft
Killing you off slowly, like Roberta Flack
 I've never heard of wack
MCs that try to step to me, I'll break your verta-back
Or vertebrae, increase the murder rates
In 79 states... Yo, check it
I'm bout to pass the mic to the next
MC who wanna step up and flex
With the techs, but make sure your shit is fresh
Come on, wreck it, who wanna be next?
It goes like this:
Broke the rubber, busted a nut up in your mother
So how do you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherfucker, talking trash like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out your track, I'll smack her up and fucked her
Always talk shit high, smoking chocolate Thai
So y'all can die, just for walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfucking marbles
Smelling like a brewery, droolin' at the way your jewelery sparkles
Head full of charcoal, smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read, disregarded rules
Skip the classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes from smashing up cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms, chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous, liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off, aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits
Set it off
Rappers get beheaded if they soft
Yo they get they wires crossed
Rappers try to step to me but I'm so ill I'll fire your boss
And this is all freestyle, killing it
While I'm filling it with adrenaline, rappers be feeling it
Like it was braille, so y'all can touch me anywhere
Cause I want you to feel me, Rappers wanna kill me, but they don't thrill me
So check it, I'm bout to wreck when I make the record
Cause I'm, skinny like an anorexic girl headed for the exit
Running butt naked away from just being date raped
Rappers? I twist 'em into a great shape
And throw 'em in the Great Lakes, cause I'm from the Michigan state
For fishermans' sake, I throw and toss 'em in
Rappers try to step to me but this is the Holocaust and you'll never win
Cause I've forever been bent, forever demented
Rappers try to step to me but their shit is sweet-scented
And I'm demented, and if I said it I meant it
Killin' any MC cause I'm Infinite, and when it
Comes to the way that I'm spittin' lyrical infinite ammunition
And putting a clip in this lyrical track that I just be rippin'
Crushing it, killing it, taking your best line and hushing it
Taking your shit and flushing it down the toilet
Taking your biggest plot and foil it
Rappers can't uncoil it, I'll take my shit and aluminum foil it
Then throw it in the microwave and watch burn up, cause I'mma blow up
Rappers? I make 'em ill enough to throw up
Don't show up if you come to the battle
"Can I speed it up? Just a little bit?
Alright that's cool. Alright
Bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it, bust it
This one for Quest."
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit changed
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Came late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last O' that I sniffed of 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turning to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screaming to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 bursting
You getting spun backwards like every word of obscene cursing
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stopping your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in the hospital and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma no a head-butt so hard, I knock us both out
No doubt[Hook]
(
Just pull the plug!
)
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol (c'mon!)
C'mon do as I do, go ahead get mad and do it
(Just pull the plug!
)
People say that I'm a bad influence
I say the world's already fucked, I'm just addin' to it
They say I'm suicidal, teenagers' newest idol
C'mon, do as I do, go ahead, get mad and do it
(Just let it go!)
[Verse 1]
Hand me an eighth
, 
beam me up and land me in space
Imma sit on top of the world (I'm here) and shit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people'll feel me
Cause I'mma still be the Mad Rapper, whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddling, makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissing me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flipping me off
No shit I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrolling corners
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beating James Todd Sr
Across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth
With a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it
I laugh at the sight of death
As I fall down a cement flight of steps
And land inside a bed of spider webs
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin' mine out
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My laser disc'll make you take a razor to your wrist
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face
And place the clip and cock it back
And let it go until your brains are rippin' out
Your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches
I'm not a role model, I don't wanna babysit kids
I got one little girl, and Hailie Jade is Shady's business
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off
Where the fuck were you when Gilbert's paid to make me dishwash?
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got
You made me get a bigger attitude than 80 Kim Scotts
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us
And our personal life, it's just words on a mic
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!
[Hook]

[Intro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts
You know, there's a story behind that there saloon
Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over
Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em
Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen
Got murdered in cold-blood
That old saloon there was their little "home away from home"
They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern
And on a quiet night
You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9"
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat
I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head
Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead
Told him each one of his boys is dead
I asked him to come to the dark side
He made a choice and said...
[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Who hard? Yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the Devil
Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man
Disgraced the race of an atheist
Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords
I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nations
Collaborating attempting to take over the Earth
[Hook 1: Eminem]
Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Above the law cause I don't agree with police either
(Shit, me neither) We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane)
No I'm not
, 
I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cause I can't find a decent vein
[Verse 4: Royce]
The disaster with dreads
I'm bad enough to commit suicide
And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cause I serve any stranger with money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches
Piss on a flag and burn it
, 
murder you then come to your funeral
Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it
Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws
With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass
I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs
Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me
From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough
To cast a avalanche
 and bust till volcanoes erupt
[Verse 5: Eminem]
I used to be a loudmouth
, remember me?
I'm the one who burned your house down, well I'm out now
And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up
And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms
And when I go to hell and I'm getting ready to leave
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe
[Hook 2: Royce]
Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil
And we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Against peaceful
, 
see you in hell for the sequel
(We'll be waiting) See you in hell
Wall Street
, Royce Da 5'9", Slim Shady
See you in hell for the sequel (bye-bye)
Bad Meets Evil, what ('til next time)
[Outro: Cowboy (Jeff Bass)]
And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil
Two of the most wanted individuals in the county
Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens
It's too bad they had to go out the way they did
Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon
But their spirits still live on till this day
Shhh...[spits] wait, did y'all hear that?

[Produced by Dr. Seuss]
[Eminem]
Arsonist, blocking a fire hose where the nozzle is
Go to hospitals, steal the blood that tests positive
Take it home, pour it in a cup and drink lots of it
Trying on your mother's clothes, trying to get these bras to fit
When she comes home, I'm waiting in the closet, with
A﻿ knife, hiding so quiet she'll probably hear the faucet drip
All my life I've been a foster kid
So if I die an early death suicide's gon' be the cause of it
[Royce Da 5'9]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse
We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other
To see which one'll swerve first
Two blind bandits panic, whose mental capacity holds
That of a globe on top of nine other planets
Kissed the cheek of the devil
Intelligence level is hell-ier than treble peakin on speakers in the ghetto
Dismissal, I'm not a fair man, disgraced the race of a atheist
Intercepting missles wit my bare hands like a patriot
One track sliced without swords, I buried the Christ corpse
In my past life when the Black Knight mounted the white horse
Then one get at you, dash you in the back of a Chevrolet
Spittin shit at you faster than your eardrum could ever play
[Eminem]
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either (shit, me neither)
[Eminem]
We ain't eager to be legal
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle
I breathe ether in three lethal amounts
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain
(He's insane) No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off
Cuz I can't find a decent vain
[Royce Da 5'9]
The disaster wit dreds
I'm bad enough to commit suicide and survive long enough
To kill my soul after I'm dead
When in danger it's funny actually my flavor's similar to a waiter
Cuz I serve any stranger wit money
I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains
While slippin bullets at point blank range like they was punches
I got a lot of evil; I got knowledge peeking out of my cerebral now that I got people locked and rock evil
While still on the beat, I hit you in your ribs so hard to think its just a touch to the floor, while your still on your feet
I'm blazin MC's, at the same time amazin MC's Somehow MC's ain't that eye-brow raisin to me
Destroying the track, un-employing the whack, exploring the facts while my man Eminem is withdrawing from crack
[Girl voice crying]
I just love him..
I just love him..
[Royce Da 5'9]
Who hard? yo I done heard worse

Oh, man

Fucking great, man
Ok, let me see
How can I begin?

Locked in Mariah's wine cellar all I had for lunch
Was bread, wine
, 
more bread, wine and
 
Captain Crunch
Red wine for breakfast and for brunch
And to soak it up an in-between snack crackers to munch
Mariah whatever happened to us? Why did we have to break up?
All I asked for was a glass of punch!
You see I never really asked for much
I can't imagine what's going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk
Luis Miguel
 
Nick Cannon better back the fuck
Up, I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk
This is Hello Kitty bedspread satin funk
Mixed with Egyptian
 with a little rap and punk
Zapp
 and 
Eric Clapton
, 
Shaft
, 
Frank Zappa
, crunk
And yeah baby I want another crack at ya
You can beat me with any spatula that you want
I mean I really want you bad, you cunt
Nick you had your fun
, 
I've come to kick you in your sack of junk
Man I could use a fresh batch of blood
So prepare your vernacular for Dracula acupuncture

Bagpipes from Baghdad
When will it ever cease
For Pete's sakes he's crazy to say the least
Bagpipes from Baghdad
What's goin through my mind
Half the time when I rhyme we're blowin up like
Bagpipes from Baghdad
Somebody turn the vacancy sign on
Cause I'm gone,
 blowing up my
Bagpipes from Baghdad
I run the streets and act
Like a madman holdin a 
Glad bag
[Verse 2]
You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
I'm the miracle whip... trickster
My signature sound when a tube of lipstick's around
I'm bound to put it on in an instant,
 
wow man
What an ensemble, what an assortment of pharma-
-ceuticals this beautiful pill dust in my palm, my
Cuticles get residue just from touchin the bottle
Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer, pull the butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword boy I'm like the fuckin Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowin ya, Norman
You're so fuckin' annoyin', drop the shovel boy
You don't know what the fuck you're doin
I ain't playin' no fuckin' more
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born
, snuck up on
Malachi made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck of, shuck of corn, Chaka Khan
Hit Jason in the face with a hockey puck and told him it's fucking on
Man what the fuck are ya doin'
You're runnin over the snowblower with the lawnmower
Blowin' your bagpipes from Baghdad
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
In the bed with two brain dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you til' your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Is what they said to the two conjoined twins
How's it going girlfriends, you need a boyfriend
You need some ointment, just set up an appointment
Who's gonna see the doctor first, we'll do a coin flip
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get goin, how bad does the going get
Baby you shouldn't have any trouble rubbin groins wit
Each other especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
An attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loins, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy! chip-
Cookie lookie even took me a Polaroid flick

[1st verse]
I came from nothing solo, straight outta the dumpster hobo
Made him a monster
, 
I was cultivatingly slanging that cocoa
Hated the po po
, 
locally known as abominable snow-o
Later the big 4' rated the home where I made the dough grow
So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros
Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you
We as a people heated in evenings doing these evils
Gotta eat to, be cool
, 
got a kid to feed did it reach you
Or did it seep thru?
 
Or do I just speak thru the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel?
When niggas on the block gotta eat, gotta cop, gotta cop when they caught by the cops
Young 2Pac's, laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks
, 
fade away
Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free
, that's why I'm

Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it
Slept it, lived it, now I spit it

[2nd verse]
Working that house off an no-doze, got an ounce to roll on
Trying to get rid of the pounds
, I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on
Same old song, young nigga thats trying to get some where I come from
Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch, only way a city boy function
In conjunction with selling this substance
Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven
I'mma be hugging these corners till these corners corner me
But currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency
Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing
It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be
Such a thirst for me
, 
life almost took a turn for the worst for me
 took to see
I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me
[Obie] Gotta do a little soul searching and [Obie] myself personally
And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me
To confirm and unblur my dreams
Best believe since burst on the scene, I'mma be here certainly
With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'mma get this cheese and that's why he's
[Hook fades out]
[Obie talking over Hook]
That's why I'm
That's what made me
Haha
That's why I'm

Ballin' Uncontrollably
[Verse 1]
Man, I got everything candy-painted, candy-painted tint, it's so dark
I'd be lying if I said I ain't hit at least nine of my friends
Plus, I got so much candy paint in my rims
Paint be flyin' off my car be candy paintin' the neighborhood kids
I got that whole block lookin' like it's Candyland
Ask about me, man, they be like, there go the candy man
I park the car in the garage and go in and
Come back the next mornin', the rims are still spinnin'
Hit the doors on that Phantom, man, that shit looks like the Batmobile
Thirty-two inch rims, shit, I ain't even got no wheels
Custom-fitted, custom-kitted wood grain
Custom everything, what's that on the seat, custom mustard stain
Now let's go hit the mall, y'all know that we finna ball
Get out the car, they be like, ah, there go them superstars
Hit every single store, flash a fuckin' wad of cash
But I ain't buying shit, bitch, kiss my candy-painted ass, we
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Hit the corner liquor store to get Corona, tip the owners
Sipped it on the way out as I dipped, I wanna rip the road up
And I'mma hit the cinema and I'mma get the hoes
When I be at a theater shit, anything goes
I'm ballin' outta control, girls know I'm loaded with dough
But shit, I'm stingy as fuck, I'm fuckin' stingy as hoes
These bitches don't get a crumb, and it come but I'm like what up
Shut up, bitch, sit up, get up off them knees, my candy paint's enough
If you're lucky, I'll let you hug me, but that's all you get
Then I'mma split, disappear, a cloud of smoke is all you see
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Bitch, get the fuck out my car if we ain't finna fuck
I'm horny as fuck bitch, are you suckin' my dick or what
I'll fuck a chick in the butt, I really don't give a shit
Is pretty Marshall gonna have to go choke me a bitch
You fuckin' keyed up my Benz bitch, I beat up my friends
Don't think I won't beat a bitch, I'll kick a six-year-old in the ribs
You fuckin' retard, I'll have you suckin' farts out my seat
I'll teach you not to know how to control your bowels when you eat
What the fuck do you think that colostomy bag is for, looks?
I ain't waste nine bullets on you for you to not sing no hooks
I fuckin' take a Make a Wish Foundation patient with me
How 'bout some coke inside of your saline solution IV
Turn around and use it on me, you tryna snort all my keys
You fuckin' get in back, you're comin' to Florida with me
Tell your momma I'mma drop you off at the hospital later
We finna make this run, take this gun and cover me, Slater and quit your
[Hook]
[Outro]
Tracy, I joined this class cuz I thought I’d be cooking with a partner
But she’s never here, and I don’t get twice the credit for all the work
I didn't invent odd numbers Seth
I know, but I’m over here in my unit, everyday, cooking my terrible tasting food, and then I gotta look over at Evan, I mean look at him, it looks like the most fun I’ve ever seen in my entire life. And, I’m just saying, I wash and dry, I’m like a single mother. And, no offense but, everyone takes this class to get an A and it’s bullshit, but uh no offense, I’m just saying. And I’m not putting down your profession, but when am I gonna need to cook tiramisu? Am I gonna be a chef? No. There’s 3 weeks left in school, give me a freaking break, sorry for cursing.OH MY GOD that’s like the coolest fucking story I’ve ever heard in my life, it’s insane. Can you tell us again? Do you have time? Tracy, Tracy, can you hear me? I’m in the car right now. Listen, I am McLovin, yeah. McLovin in the house! McLovin in the house! Yeah



[Bridge]
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own
Everybody has a private world, where they can be alone
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?
Are you reaching out for me, and I'm reaching out for you
[Verse 1]
I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need something to pull me out this dump
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up
I don't know how or why or when I ended up in this position I'm in
I'm starting to feel distant again,
 
so I decided just to pick this pen
Up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit or
Come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow,
 
but I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow,
 
but I know one fact: I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow,
 
but you'd have to walk a thousand miles
[Hook]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes, just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find, look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you
[Verse 2]
I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom
I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as
I walk in,
 
it's like all eyes on me,
 
so I try to avoid any eye contact
Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation like I want that
I'm not looking for extra attention,
 
I just wanna be just like you
Blend in with the rest of the room,
 
maybe just point me to the closest restroom
I don't need no fuckin' man-servant,
 
tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like, "Ha!
Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, goddamn!"
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown
So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help
Now I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in,
 
and get up and get my own
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went
I dreamed of being that cool kid,
 
even if it meant acting stupid
Aunt Edna
 
always told me "Keep making that face it'll get stuck like that"
Meanwhile, I'm just standing there holding my tongue trying to talk *like this*
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen "Stop" sign pole at 8 years old
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't trying to impress my friends no mo'
But I already told you my whole life story not just based on my description
Cause where you see it from where you're sittin' is probably 110% different
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
What size you wear? I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet
[Hook] + [Bridge]
[Outro]
To my babies: stay strong, daddy'll be home soon
And to the rest of the world, God gave you them shoes that fit you
So put em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny, never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful

[chester]
I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So just give me
[eminem]
I'm just so fucking depressed, I just can't seem to get out this slump
If I could just get over this hump but I need something to pull me out this dump
[chester]
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
[eminem]
I don't know how or why or when
I ended up in this position I'm in
[chester]
Connect the space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide
[eminem]
Some shit's so hard to swallow
And I just can't sit back and wallow
In my own sorrow
But I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow
One tough act to follow
I'll be one tough act to follow
Here today, gone tomorrow
But you'd have to walk a thousand miles
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
[chester]
There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve
So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide
[chester & pimp knuckles]
Im back dividing someones hand
Im here with jamie were screwed up your ass
Let me one thing say im just starting in my own good fucking way
Let me hear what you done
Man im here alone
Im not your own son
I ask whats wrong
[chester & pimp knuckles]
In every loss in every lie
Is a moment the place you die
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret and each goodbye
[eminem]
Miles In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to
Feel your pain, you feel mine
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
So don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
Oh, they can all get fucked
Just stay true to you, so
Divide
[eminem]
Now I could have either just
Sat on my ass and pissed and moaned
[pimp knuckles]
Fuck the enemys who stole the money
And jacking all my beautiful songs
[eminem]
I was never the type of kid
To wait by the door and pack his bags
Who sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
For a dad to show up who never did
[pimp knuckles]
Fuck the tits better going further with my life
Jacking cars for my stupid job and living with this ignorant wife
But they told me twice the way you go the songs you wrote
Always be happy your not alone
Bitch pick up the stupid phone
The stupid women the stupid car
It is broken wtf were here lets start a war
Here today
In my own way
[eminem]
But I already told you my whole life story
Not just based on my description
[pimp knuckles]
Were driving crazy on the road
Driving on the wrong road killing citizen
Just take a nap im tired full of shit eating
The rest for it gets old
Here today
One thing
You didn't know your soul is solded
[eminem]
In my shoes, just to see
What it's like, to be me
Give me reason
To prove me wrong
Go inside each other's minds
Just to see
The distance in your eyes
[pimp knuckles]
Were spying everywhere you go one thing
I can kill you but your friend is there
[chester]
Give me reason
To prove me wrong
To fill this hole
Connect the space between
[eminem]
Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful, oh
They can all get fucked
Just stay true to you
[chester]
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
[pimp knuckles]
I can't see you
Your the only one
I can't beat you
But fuck that
I wanna hear my music
This is a serious situation
Now were the here in a good nation
[chester & pimp knuckles]
The distance in your eyes
I hope your the one that die
But fuck that i wanna kill everyone
That fucks with me or will see
[eminem]
Yeah... To my babies. Stay strong
Daddy will be home soon
And to the rest of the world, god gave you the shoes
That fit you, so put 'em on and wear 'em
And be yourself, man, be proud of who you are
Even if it sounds corny
Don't ever let anyone tell you, you ain't beautiful, so...
[chester & pimp knuckles]
Divide
I hope you die
Divide
I dont know why

[Intro]
I can feel the heat rising, everything is on fire
Today is a painful reminder of why
We can only get brighter
The further you put it behind ya
But right now I'm on the inside
(Lookin' out, cause)
[Hook: Sia]
I'm standin' in the flames
It’s a beautiful kind of pain
Settin' fire to yesterday
Find the light, find the light, find the light
[Verse 1]
Yesterday was the tornado warning
Today's like the morning after
Your world is torn in half
You wake in its wake to start the mourning process
And rebuilding, you're still a work in progress
Today's a whole new chapter
It's like an enormous asth-ma
Thunderstorm has passed ya
You weathered it and poked its eye out
With the thorn bush that you
Used to smell the roses
Stopped to inhale, can't even tell your nose is, stuffed
So focused on the bright side
Then you floor the gas pedal
And hit the corner fast the more asserted
Never looking back
May hit the curb
But every day is a new learning curve
 
as you
Steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve
But you have to
To avert a disaster
Lucky no permanent damage
Cause they hurt you so bad
It's like they murdered your ass
And threw dirt on your casket but you've returned from the ashes
And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline
And while you're burning the past, standing in the inferno and chant
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
You're so familiarized with what having to swallow this pill is like
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life
And it's as though you feel you've died
Cause you've been killed inside
But yet you're still alive
Which means you will survive
Although today you may weep cause you're weakened
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless
The light that you're seekin'
It begins to seep in
That's the only thing keepin'
You from leapin' off the mothafreakin' deep end
And I'm pullin' for you to push through this feeling
And with a little time that should do the healing
And by tomorrow
You may even feel so good that you're willing to forgive 'em even after
All the shit you been put through this feeling of resilience is building
And the flames are burning quick as fire would through this building
You're sealed in but you're fireproof, flame retardant,
 
you withstood it
And as you climb up to the roof, you're just chillin' you look down
Cause you're so over 'em
You could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling
[Bridge]
As time passes
Things change every day
But wounds, wounds heal, but scars still remain the same
But tomorrow today's going down in flames
Throw the match, set the past ablaze
[Verse 3]
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire
From the heat
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief
And as you say goodbye to the grief
It's like watching the walls melt in your prison cell
But you've extinguished this living hell
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream
[Hook]
[Bridge: Sia]
I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn
Rising, a phoenix from the flames
I have learned, from fighting fights, that weren't mine
Not with fists, but with wings that I will fly
[Hook]

((UNRELEASED))
[Eminem]
Yo, guys! Do you know what is this:
It is old and ugly as fuck
It looks like mutant froggy duck
He's a prick, he's a cunt
And he never smoked blunt!
[Kuniva]
Maybe Michael Jackson, hahahah...
[Eminem]
No...
[Proof]
I know, that dude is Nelson Mandela!
[Eminem]
No, guys! It is Benzino!
[Everybody]
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAA...

[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-ag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, wait that's my pigment
Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
[Bridge]
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) all night long
[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud,
 
cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berserk, grab your vial, yeah
[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced,
 
so I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's banging, jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yes siree 'Bob', I was thinking the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, baw with da baw, dang-dang
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid?
Hope so, now ho...
[Bridge]
[Hook 2]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
I say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, go berzerk, get your vinyls
[Scratch]
[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh, sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you a-loan (Car note)
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman,
 
unless you're a swallow
Word Rick, word man you heard,
 
but don't get discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
[Bridge] + [Hook]

Music.
I had met Paul, Em's manager, a few years ago and we always talked about the possibility of getting together to work on something at some point down the road.
 
We just worked out it was meant to be at this time. I think it's unlike any current hip hop songs. If you listen to what's going on in hip hop, this is not what this is.
 
Em wanted to do something kind of throwback to some of the early records that we were making in the old days. And it more reflects that energy of the early days of hip hop.
We were in the studio working on a bunch of different ideas and this was one of the later ones to come up.
 It started with a sample and the sample that we started with ended up not being in the record. 
The song sort of evolves. It started one way, it kind of got programmed and written to and then it changed into a whole different song.
And I felt the track was really strong and didn't really know what direction Em was gonna go in vocally. And then when I heard the vocals, that was pretty, exciting because it was not at all what I was expecting. And just the energy in it and the lyrics and the style of it.
 It's so well done and so smart and so funny. It's just great. In this song, we ended up using a wired guitar and hook and everything else pretty much is programmed.
It reminds me of old hip hop videos and I think it's really entertaining and I look forward to see it all put together and done. 
But in the shooting stages, the pieces I've seen look really entertaining.

[Estrofa 1]
Ésto está a punto de empezar, esta fiesta tiene pinta de coñazo
Vamos a volver al hip-hop puro y empezar desde cero
Voy a dejarle sangriento a este tema, echáos para atrás
Por eso mi boli necesita un cuaderno porque mi rap tiene la regla
Al igual que hice con la adicción, voy a rapear
Como un mago, a los críticos los convierto en grillos
Todavía no saben si protestarlo o comprarlo
Pero no tardan nada en ser ensartados cuando los mando a tomar por culo
Soy tan crack que se me ve pálido, pues bueno, así es mi pigmentación
Voy a darlo todo
, 
ya bish, qué pasa Kendrick
Vamos a volver al Slim original, puta
El arte del MC mezclado con da Vinci y MC Ren
Y no me refiero al amigo de Stimpy, puta
He sido enemigo público desde que pensabas que PE era la educación física
[Puente]
Quítate los zapatos, suéltate el pelo y vuélvete loco toda la noche
Déjate crecer la barba, sé un bicho raro y vuélvete loco toda la noche
[Estribillo]
Vamos a darlo todo hasta derrumbar la casa
Así que sube el volumen, porque va a ser un caos hasta la madrugada
Así que nena, haz como K-Fed y pierde control, pierde control
Di que te la pela todo, antes de que la diñemos
La vida es demasiado corta como para no echarle toda la carne al asador
Así que todo el mundo, todo el mundo, volvéos locos, bailad
[Scratch]
[Estrofa 2]
Será por cómo me visto, verdad?
Pantalón planchado, Nikes sin estrenar
Así que supongo que no ha sido
La colonia o la loción aftershave que les ha hecho desmayarse
Además, acabo de aparecer con un abrigo más guay que la pintura fresca
Así que, si el amor es una partida de ajedrez, jaque mate
Pero tu chica tiene cuerpazo, quiero unirme, gang - bang-bang
Si señor, estaba pensando lo mismo
Así que ven a subirte a la piedra de este chaval (Kid Rock), baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka-chicka wow-wow
Coger un taxi, quiero bajar b-b-bow, bow
Ir más despacio, tirar la toalla, t-t-towel toww
Bajar el nivel, no sé cómo (huh-huh) how-how
Por lo menos sé que no lo sé
La pregunta es si vosotros payasos son suficientemente listos como para sentiros estúpidos
Espero que sí, y ahora perra...
[Puente]
[Estribillo]
[Estrofa 3]
Se dice que el amor es tan fuerte como el jarabe de tos y el poliestireno
Pero lo que está claro es que me quedé dormido y me desperté en aquel Monte Carlo
Con la Kardashian fea
Lamar, ah, lo siento, hemos puesto el listón muy bajo los dos
Rimas duras, drogas duras, aunque eso es el pasado
Pero he tomado codeína suficiente como para lanzar Future al día siguiente
Nena, no tengo dinero que prestarte
Pero estoy buscando una manera de estar contigo sola, financiación!
Oh, Marshall Mathers, todos deberían saberlo ya
Haced espuma con el jabón de barra, Kangols y Carhartt-less Cargos
Nena vas a acabar con el corazón roto, no digas tonterías
Niña lerda, no le he dicho "baby" a nadie desde Birdman
A no ser que eres una golondrina
Eso es lo que hay, pero no te desanimes nena
Este es tu tema, a menos que tengas mugre entre los dedos del pie...
[Puente + Estribillo]

The Wild.. West
 {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide..
[Dr. Dre]
All you see is the sun, reflectin off of the gun
I'm ready for the showdown, that go down at one
Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now
I'mma show you how real cowboys get down
I'm polishin gold, waitin for this drama to unfold
I got a blunt rolled
Feelin bold, 
gangsters blood runs cold
It's time to reload this old .45 colt
The wind's gusty, it's hot, muggy and dusty
Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty
It's passed noon, he should be here soon
Sip a little moonshine inside a saloon
All of a sudden I can hear the sound of hoofs
Sounds like a thousand wolves
I cock back, put the toast in the holster and froze
I pose like a poster, he's closer than close
I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fights dirty
But I'mma put thirty inside him and leave early
And just when I went to fill him with hot lead
I put the gun to his head, and this is what he said
[Eminem]
You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again
But I know you
 - 
the name's Slim
 - 
you want revenge?
Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you
I'm tellin the truth, I got a price on my head too, cause when you..
[Hook]
You ride like a cowboy toward the sun
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run
Got your gold and you got your gun
But life as an outlaw just begun
Got your shotgun by your side
Got your horse and you got your pride
You ride til there ain't no place to hide
It's sad cause the bad guys always die
[Dr. Dre] + (Eminem)
He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face
He said take ten paces shit I took eight
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain
My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said
(You need bullets, hurry up run!) {*imitating Slick Rick*}
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned
(Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want)
I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot
So what we gon' do, it's on you
(Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?)
The Chronic!
(Well all we gotta do is find a map to part two)
(And plus I know who's got it)
Who?
(Some old dude, he's got 26 plaques and he already sold two)
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot
An old ghost town that everybody forgot
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot
Slim grabbed the shotgun (Dre here's the plot)
(Eminem)
This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us
[Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it comin]
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps
[Dr. Dre]
I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers
Kicked the swingin doors in, started gun slinging
I could hear somebody singin - it sounded like a "G Thang,"
And a verse from "Keep Their Heads Ringin"
I said "It's Dre's Day," and started to spray
Against 1800, he pulls a AK
Hollow tips started flyin every which way
(Eminem)
That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge
I fired the first shot, spun his body around
He hit the ground and landed upside down
Dre grabbed the map, the plaques and the gold
I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled
Chorus 2X
Always die..
The Wild.. Gotham
The Wild.. West {*BANG BANG, BANG*}
Ha ha, riiiiide..

[Intro: Eminem]
Welcome to Detroit
This is the BET, Shady 2.0 Cypher 2011
Myself, Slaughterhouse and Yelawolf
White Dawg
 
(thank you cracker) get 'em!
[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Put these mothafuckas in a box and I send em away
Put em in a gray 'llac and pop the trunk
And throw em in the back, jack; ha, dig em a grave
Put a brick inside that Xerox when I print up a page
Moving keys I can relate, cause I live in the cage
I throw up the A, I take em to school, I give them a grade
An Eazy-E for effort, that's WWA
White with an attitude,
 
alphabet soup is on my plate
All I got is Z's they sleeping on me, I can't get em awake
I spoon feed em a sound in a room full of deceivers and clowns
Who believe in making it rain cause all they see is the clouds
And I watch from the couch of the VIP like a potato
With a bunch of meatheads like fuck it, I'll just feed 'em a cow
Plenty of white boys to pick from this year
But before you pick a pepper, you better pick up your heater
Cause even Peter Piper could pick up a mic but what it's like
To pick a fight with me is like putting Nikes on a cheetah
Better speed up, or at least in my case Adidas
I'm out this bitch,
 
drinking Sprite by the two-liter
Holler
Shady Records
[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Say I'm from the new school, I'mma say check your tone and watch your mouth
If they teaching how to Dougie, I'm condoning dropping out
Forced to wild, y'all birthed me then gave me up
I just perfected being hip-hop's foster child,
 
now check it
Don't blame y'all for being trash, fans are copping it
The radio's the crime scene, the masses are the hostages
In my youth I'd throw shots, the fad was dodging it
I'm grown: I ain't watching the throne, I'm sabotaging it
You see that four-headed monster in the storm looms
Snipe 'em from a distance: the scope got a long zoom
You Super Mario thugs is in the wrong room
Gotta figure here, you won't get bigger if you on shrooms
If it was left to me, I'd revive what the game be 'bout
I'd 've took the wine outta Amy house
Enough raps from you scrub cats bout cockin' a snub back
Wayne couldn't teach me how to love that
But I got this chick from uptown, she my summer bunny
Both parents broke, but she come from money
Think my bread is her paper to burn
So I lock her out, and now she doubt David is Stern
She's so bad,
 
I make her hit the telly from a taxi
Then dead her in the Holiday Inn, learned that from Max B
That's why the haters envy, kinda wanna send me llamas
I made it right before their eyes like I was Benihanas
Is it me or is what I'm hearing just pitiful
Airwaves the same, now the stereo's typical
My skin's thick so the critics ignored
So unafraid to die, you'd think I did it before
The boy's Rodman with the trash talk
Magic or Walt
 
with the black ball
Way I bounce off the asphalt with cat paws
Glass jaw,
 
Hood of your mask will be the Blackfoot with no passport
Body be found in a mansion in one of my trapdoors
If punks had award you status whores categore
Probably be that of awards between
 
Michael Rappaport
 and 
Kenny Lattimore
I know hip-hop's alive and well
If it died, you other crews wouldn't survive the smell
[Verse 3: Crooked I]
I spot a victim, the plot'll thicken when the clock is ticking
I caught him slipping, I gotta give him a shot
I hit him with proper spitting, hottest writtens and compositions
So competition's a contradiction somebody mention they got a Crooked
Highly fiction we probably different,
 
got Gotti henchmen
Opposition, I'll body quick as Bugatti engines
I'm on a mission to get richer, the sickest lyric-kicker
Digging a ditch for different spitters
Weak lyricists get disfigured
Sip liquor,
 
spit like a sick mixture
Of Notorious, Pun and L, get the big picture
The poster,
 
I'll roast ya
My mind so deadly it's just like the beanie is close to a holster
It's over,
 
control my whole coastal region
Like I'm supposed to,
 
flow is going postal even
Open season, heart close to freezing
Ruthless as Eazy nigga,
 
approach, I'm squeezing believe me
Dopest Westcoaster breathing
 
so most ya hope I'm vegan
Nope I'm beefing
 
rappers need to keep it trill
Give me a beat to kill
Too many people still eating sleeping pills
People sleeping on my ether skills
And y'all ain't even real, you bout to die in this cypher
Before you die you should do the Jada and leave a Will
For real
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
I ain't a rap dude, I'm a dude who rap
Before this, I was moving crack
Killers y'all become when y'all rhyme, I salute and dap
And if I blink, they'll remove your snaps
You ain't cool, you wack with your foolish act
Skinny jeans don't mean your ass shoot, it means your booty claps
Don't play like Tyler Perry
This the Slaughterhouse of pain
Flow brown, tight and heavy
When it come to 16's, I'm a fiend
Seen in the studio near a needle with a mean lean
Probably writing bars to Nas' Thief's Theme
 
getting my Yaowa on
Man, all these Olajuwons, we the dream team
This is an all day slaughter
They fiending for us to break like
 
Beyonce's water
The four quarters doing all the eating
And y'all gotta know why I made the cut, I'm Puerto Rican
Ortiz keep the fire ready
And tryna put me out's like tryna
 
steal a transvestite from Eddie
[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm do or die dope,
 
and you can make the sticker sitting
On the door of that Phantom, your suicide note
Hi Rihanna...is Nicki living with you
Let me know so I can buy binoculars and telescopes
Hi Rihanna...I don't need to know you better
You tell me you love my music again, we go together
Bye Rihanna...
 
now back to y'all fools
We rock out like the outside of a guitar school
Thousand dollar frames I prefer to see the world through
Don't ask me nothing 'bout Budden, I beat my girl too
You ask me why do I keep her, I say it's cheaper to
That's why I ride around in a Rolls like Wiz Khalifa do
Rappers I'm your daddy, I tell you straight as this
You don't kill but your father will like Jayden Smith
I tell you like I tell my Spanish chick
You fly, but I ain't going down on no landing strip
So get your wax on like Daniel San
Or I'mma have to run like De la Hoya in drag when cameras come
Point out the greatest rapper alive I head shot 'em
Smack his girl on the butt and buy her some
 
red bottom
Bring every deceased rapper back to see his wife
While I'm cyber-sexing with Jessica Alba via Skype
I’m on my D-boy,
 
Deebo thing
Spiritual steelo swing like Cee-Lo Green
Get out the camera with yo B Roll bling
You know your flow is wack
We cornered the market like a Wal-Mart in a cul-de-sac
Yeah, this is what two million singles sold and an album that's gold
Look like without having to sell your soul
[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo, lyrical miracle, spiritual individual, criminal
Subliminal, in your swimming pool
You're about to see peace destroyed, it'll never be restored
When I unleash these beastly hordes on your CD stores
Wanna stop it: you gon' need a priest, at least three swords
A license to ill from the Beastie Boys,
 
three Ouija boards
A squeegee and please be warned, don't ask what the squeegee's for
Or the holy water,
 
acid raps
 
that'll eat these floors
Eat a hole in a rhyme book, you see these horns
And as for me you ask when I'm gone, will he be mourned
..is puke luke warm,
 
should Casey Anthony do porn
Can that chick fit a new born dead baby inside a fricking shoebox
With a shoehorn
Smothered in chloroform
 
so she can go get her groove on
Can she duct tape and Velcro a fetus
Joell, yo tell Joe I need his
Empty box from his old shell toed Adidas
So I can put these babies in the fetal position
They're getting elbows to the penis
Yeah big deal
I took some little kids Big Wheel
 
and spit in his frickin big kids meal
Quit tryna bite me and pinch you wench sit still
Did you just put your six inch heel through my Benz windshield
Is it dust we bout to kick up
Can Yelawolf fit a fifth of rum in a big cup
Between his stick shift in his frigging pickup
And drink like a hick redneck hillbilly will til he gets hicc-ups
Flipping the script up like Mike Vick
Getting bit in his junk by a Pit, yup I'm a sick pup
I'd be a horrible magician cause I'll fuck a trick up
Fix your lips up to say something fly, or zip up
A B, let's C, you said you were gonna do X-Y-Z
Til you fuck around and get dropped like an E when you add an I-N-G[Intro]
([Jay-Z]Best rapper alive) x4
[Jay-Z] Whoo!...Ladies and gentlemen...
[Eminem] You're now about to witness the power of...
[Jay-Z] H, to the Izzo... and...
[Eminem] Shady (ha-ha)... It's showtime
[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
Yo, gather round hustlers that's if you still livin'
And get on down, to that old Jig rhythm
Here's a couple of jewels to help you get through your bid in prison
A ribbon in the sky, keep your head high
I, Young 'Vito, voice of the young people
Mouthpiece for hustlers I'm back motherfuckers
Your reign on the top was shorter than leprechauns
Y'all can't fuck with Hov', what type of X y'all on?
I got great lawyers for cops so dress warm
Charges don't stick to dude he's teflon
I'm too sexy for jail like I'm Right Said Fred
I'm not guilty, now GIMME back my bread
Mr. District Attorney I'm not sure if they told you
I'm on TV every day, where the fuck could I go to
Plus - Hov' don't run, Hov' stand and fight
Hov's a soldier, Hov' been fightin all his life so
What could you do to me? It's not new to me
Sue me; fuck you - what's a couple dollars to me?
But you will respect me, simple as that
Or I got no problem goin back
I'm representin for the seat where Rosa Parks sat
Where Malcolm X was shot, where Martin Luther was popped
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The ruler's back
[Hook]
(Best Rapper Alive) x4
[Jay-Z]
Uhh, uh-huh uhh uhh
I, am, BACK, niggas -
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn the motherfuckin music up
[Jay-Z & Eminem] Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
[Eminem]"Give me the mic, show me where the fucking studio's at"
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass

"Can't leave rap alone the game needs me"

[Verse 1: Mos Def]
For sinners, saints
 and 
scramblers
 and gamblers
And 
dirty money handlers
, 
dignitaries
 and 
champions
, 
narcotic traffickers
Talented number runners and 
racketeers
Stars of stage, page and cameras,
 slang swingers and 
swaggerers
Double barrels and Derringers,
 
automatics and miracles
Europe Asia and Africa, all the time in America
Atlantic, Ashland, Alblemarle to Albany
Bridge into Baltic, Bedford Ave, Bergen Street
Clinton to Cadman, Church Ave to Clarendon
Road to Central Avenue, Cooper House, Cypress
And live from Bedford-Stuyvesant
The livest
 
high flyingest pilot bombardier from Pyrrhus
Stationed live and direct, 
Medina
 mastermind set
Ya can't lock my set now lock off, cool
Peace to the nation of the Gods and the Earths
And the Sun, Moon & Stars,
 
furthermore born knowledge go hard
[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Remix, 
rising up out of the flames like a phoenix
Strainin' to carry the weight of my brain like a genius
Knowin' I'm sowin' them seeds
Let's see whose thumb is the greenest
If I said it I mean it
And did it because I need it
Eat sleep it and bleed it
Write it down and then read it
Asphalt to the cement
Your trash talk is deleted
Blastoff, I lay them out like a 
Tempurpedic
Black Thought, I told you I'ma win eventually
This unsung, underrated, under appreciated
The one them underachievers had underestimated
Finally graduated from something that's so hated
To one of the most sacred, nobody gonna take it
Face it, I keep doing it well
Doin' it sans assistance
Is do it yourself, 
doin' it below the radar
We doin' it stealth,
 
doing it again
For Illadelph
 and who else? But check it out
Y'all see him on a job, 
see my eyes focused where the prize be
I'm like Martin Luther King you like Rodney
The difference is I give it everything inside me
Dear Diary, my fans still swear by me
Even though I'm late night now
 
like here's Johnny
Swimming with them great whites now
 is where you'll find me
Funny how it break right down but never mind me
I'm forever grimy, guess it's just Philly shining
Rock rolla 
bi-polar like Phyllis Hyman
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend opening up a bottle of dopamine
You're just hoping you don't get roped for your throat get choked anything
Oh and just think how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates
 in the ribs with a 
switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big, if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller
 
but you can bet your fuckin' bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holler at you, mama
It's like I'm off the bombom when I bring the fuckin' drama
Used to bomb ya like Saddam
 
but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fuckin' cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
So Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer a picture
Of my genitalia with a note saying "bitch, I can't wait to nail ya"
Drug paraphernalia beware the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in the sheep's clothes; he just shaved his hair off Cecilia


Don't put a K in front of that though, when I MC
Cause I'm not the king of this microphone booth
It's more like a phone booth
Superman in this bitch,
 
Kryptonite won't do
It gives me more power,
 
I bump the Fat Boys and
Eat rat poison,
 
take meteor showers
Fresh outta the mental hospital
And me not flossing a middle finger while I hop in a mosh pit'll
Be like Nas doing gospel or R&B, you crazy
Me pushin' up daisies, that thought is impossible
As if flashin' across the news
Posdnuos was caught with a prostitute
With a huge johnson, boobs and a monstrous tube of lube
And a bra, some boots, some panties and an aqua blue Mazda
Swallowing a popsicle, playing tonsil pool
So kill the rumors it ain’t happening
I’ma rap 'til I'm fossil fuel

[Intro]
I don't understand! Why are you being so MEAN?
You're a MEAN, MEAN MAN!
[Hook]
You are just jealous of me cause you, you just can't do what I do
So instead of just admitting it, you walk around and say
All kinds of really mean things about me
Cause you're a meanie, a meanie
But it's only cause you're, just really jealous of me
Cause I'm what you want to be, so you just look like an idiot
When you say these mean things, cause it's too easy to see
You're really just a big weenie, big weenie
[Verse 1]
Alright listen, I need you to focus
I need you to go dig deep in your mind,
 
this is important
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment
Now I need you to open, your mind - your eyes close 'em
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis
For the next four and a half minutes,
 
we are going to explore
Into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous
Now why did they make 
Yoo-Hoo?
 
Pippity ga-ga poo-poo
Psych I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening
Okay, now I need your undivided attention
Sir I have a question - why do I always sense this
Undeniable tension, from the moment that I enter into the room
It gets all quiet and whispers
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?
I've been dying to ask, it's been itching at me, is it just because
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line
I was going to say something extremely important
But I forgot who or what it was - I fucked up
Psych I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I FUCKED up, ain't it?
But I can bust one take without looking at no paper
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day
For me to say the truth, okay?
 
You're drooling, you have tooth decay
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?
A bunch of sweets or something, what? You munch a bunch of
 
Crunch 'N Munch?
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, your breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?
Yes I do sir, what am I on? You sir, are on truth serum
"Marshall I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible
Evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurities!"
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Alright now we, we're going to conduct
That experiment that we were talking about earlier
Just to see what a frog, looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy
Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblance here?
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror
How about now? What do you have in common?
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies
Now take my weenie out of your mouth
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room
Somewhere crying, curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is torturous
My point is this - 
that if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink
Now I forgot what the chorus is,
 you're just a
[Hook]
Get the fuck off my dick!

Spoken: A Rapper Imitating Eminem as Bin Laden]
Oh Dr Dre. Or should I say Dr Gay
You are very bad man, you diss the wrong motherfucker. You think Osama won't diss you back biaaatch
[Verse 1:]
Things just ain't the same for Osama
So much drama since the World Trade Bombings
And the Pentagon got the whole world calling
Me to kill all of congress, like...
[blurred]
The Strangest things can happen to an Afghan
When people get wrapped up in Islam and Allah
Then some shiteaters fly planes and wreak havoc
Then go drop the blame on Bin Laden
Now I got a faggot-ass rapper attacking me
With this gangsta rap, like I'm not gonna battle
Dr Dre? The man wasn't done shit since NWA
And gave Eazy-E AIDS
Don't make me go Suge Knight on your fat ass
You homofuck, 
you ain't the only one goin' platinum
Osama Bin Laden, keeping it gangsta
Fuck Dr Dre, I'm the Aftermath
[Hook:]
Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
And everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who've got people they know, so I suggest you lay low
[Verse 2:]
Oh Dr Dre look at you, you fool
I use your own rap against you, and I'm better
Lick my balls, until they are dry
Sorry... 
come again
 *gunshot*
Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden
This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson
Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive
Threatening to find 
my little cave
 and blast it
Now I've got to worry about this wannabe gansta
Who pays other rappers to write his wack shit
Everyone knows that your beats are helped man
And you'll never blow by yourself man
Sorry, you'd blow... blow cocks
Use the hole as a straw and blow sperm out your nostrils
I don't give a hurried fuck, call Slim Shady
Snoop Dogg, D.O.C, Wren and Jay-Z
To write a verse, fuck I'll do it for ya
You still lick dick, this is 
Booshu Babara
Do you know who, do you know what, do you know who?
Let's keep this between me and you
[Hook]
Osama...
Osama...
Oooosama...
O-o-o-osama...
Biatch

[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to pick it
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham,
 
ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
[Bridge]
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk) all night long
[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berserk) shake your body
[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made them just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, gang – bang-bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this Kid’s rock, baw-wit-da-baw dang-dang
P-p-p pow-pow chicka bow chicka wow-wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down b-b-bow, bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel toww
Dumb it down, I don’t know how (huh-huh) how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho...
[Bridge]
[Hook]
[Scratch]
[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard, though that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn’t everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, Kangols and Carhartt-less Cargos
Girl you’re fixing to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you’re a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam
[Bridge + Hook]

[Bizarre]
We got something for the bitches
[Intro: Eminem]
These bitches always be all, giggling and shit
But they get mad when their favorite song don't come on in the club
Catch an attitude and shit
So we got one for them, it goes like this
[Verse 1: Eminem]
We wrote a song for the hoes
You like to hear it, here it goes
A little something you probably won't hear on your radios
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows
And if I'm talking too fast it just means you're listening too slow
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, bitch
Ju jah jah jah dah du ju jah, you just made me mess up, bitch
Blibiri babiler blabber, it don't matter, I'm just blabbering
Like you understand what I'm saying anyway
I'm just traveling in one ear and I'm out the other
You're so fucking drunk all you hear is the beat b-b-beat
I could be saying anything, just get your ass on the floor
Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before
Baby and shake that ass like a whore
[Hook: Eminem and Kon Artis]
Yeah, I'm talking to you, bitch
Get up and dance, bitch
Wiggle that ass, bitch
Yeah that's it, bitch
Yeah, I called you a bitch, bitch
What you going to do about it bitch
Sit there and cry like a little bitch, bitch
Get up and dance bitch
Wiggle that ass bitch
You little trash, bitch
Yeah, that's it
Yeah, I called you a trash, bitch
Not trailer trash, switch
Take the person you with and exchange partner, bitch
[Verse 2: Swifty]
Tell me that it ain't no hanging and fuck calling home
Until you look at me, before you answer the phone
When I flee, your ass can get naked and be as free
As you wanna be freak, but I'm taking the key with me
You ain't gonna get shit, so don't even ask
Disrespect my wishes bitch I'll beat your ass
Watch me coming home full, eating half of your doggy bag
And I leave laughing, while you calling me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
And before she cut them on, Kuniva already switched
Your ass ain't even riding with Swift unless you're hoeing
When I'm done, I'll throw you out and ask you where you going
[Verse 3: Bizarre]
Ho ain't the only thing you call a girl
Slut, Tramp
(Oh, how you doing, Sheryl)
Ever since I was eight I been starting to hate
I said fuck the hoes and started eating cheesecake
Scrambled eggs and steak, strawberries and grapes
Damn that sounds great, hold on wait 
(Bizzy!)
Okay back to the bitches, wash the dishes after that
Give me stitches, a fucking half Indian chick, sucked my dick
This time tomorrow, I won't remember shit
Got respect for a player, got on 
snoop gators
And they ain't now and laters, bitch
[Hook]
[skit]
[Kon Artis] Hey, baby, what's up with you

[Kuniva] Shh, shit, shut up nigga, no, shut up
[Dina Rae] Man, fuck both of y'all niggas
[Kuniva] See I was trying to be polite, stank ass trick
[Kon Artis] Oh, somebody is jacking off tonight
[Verse 4: Proof]
Oh you a bitch but don't choke
I say the same to my Momma
I got Christina, Britney with me
Shit, we banging Madonna
Watch her strip you on that ten bitch ain't got change for a dollar
Blow your tongue and give this one the mouth you came with a condom
Quick cum is the motto, so just swallow and breathe
Swallow and breathe, now swallow these seeds
I know you mocha lotti Mommies won't get down on your knees
You want some money honey damn you must be outta your weave
Hit the telly fuck her belly you ain't gotta go weak
Plus you wanna be a model you need a lot of more sleep
I'm a pimp bitch don't be shy, show me them big tits
Your lipstick, I want it smeared all on my limp dick
For instance, busting nuts is only my interest
So princess, don't get your feelings hurt cause men just
Party and bullshit
 till she gargle and swallow the dick
I'm taking the train to spain, don't bother calling me, bitch
[Hook]
[Outro: Kon Artis]
Yeah you heard me bitch, did I stu-stu-stutter stupid
You ain't listein to the words of this song anyway
All you do is listen to the beats with your dumbass, bitch
Dancing, trying to get a nigga money in the club with your stupid manipular self
We was talking bout you DODO
You, you dumb bitch you
The one that want a drink and dont want to pay for it
Spend all your money you make all week on that dress
And I spill a drink on it, acting like I'm drunk when I'm not
I'm just trying to fuck
I'm just trying to fuck, bitch

[Intro Snoop Dogg & (Dr. Dre)]
(Yeah what up Detroit)
Nu-uh, nu-uh nuh no he didn't
They didn't do it again, you shitted on these niggas two times, Dr. Dre?
(Oh fo' sho')
Uh-uh, naw ya smell that,
 
this is special right here
Yeah, it's a toast to the boogie baby,
 
to the boogie-oogie-oogie
Yeah, y'know, what's crackin' Dre
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Just let me lay back and
 
kick some ol' simplistic pimp shit
On Slim's shit
 
and start riots like Limp Bizkit
Throw on Guilty Conscience at concerts
And watch mosh pits til motherfuckers knock each other unconscious (Watch out nigga!)
Some of these crowds that Slim draws is rowdy as Crenshaw Boulevard
When it's packed and fulla cars
Some of these crowds me and Snoop draw is niggas from Crenshaw
From Long Beach to South Central
Whoa, not these niggas again
These grown-ass ignorant men with hair-triggers again
You and what army could harm me
D-R-E and Shady,
 
with Doggy from Long Beach?
Came a long way, to making these songs play
It'll be a wrong move, to stare at me the wrong way
I got a long uz' and I carry it all day
Sometimes it's like a nightmare, just being Andre but I
[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Somehow, some way
Holla nigga, you know about Dogg-ay (Snoop Dogg)
Now let me cut these niggas up and show em where the fuck I'm coming from
I get the party cracking from the shit that I be spitting, son
Hit-and-run, get it done; get the funds, split and run
Got about fifty guns and I love all of 'em the same, bang bang
Damn baby girl what's your name
I forgot, what'd you say it was, damn a nigga buzzed
Hanging in the club with my nephew Eminem
What up cuz
The Great White American Hope
Done hooked up with the King of the motherfucking West Coast, baby
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
And you don't really wanna fuck, with me
Only nigga that I trust, is me
Fuck around and make me bust, this heat
(That's the devil, they always wanna dance)
[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I'm the Head Nigga In Charge, I'm watching you move
You're found dead in your garage with ten o'clock news coverage
Gotta love it cause I expose the facade
Your little lungs is too small to hotbox with Gods
All jokes aside, come bounce with us
Standing over you with a twelve gauge, about to bust
It's like ashes to ashes and dust to dust
I might leave in the bodybag, but never in cuffs
So who do you trust, they just not rugged enough
When things get rough I'm in the club shooting with Puff
Bitch please, you must have a mental disease
Assume the position and get back down on your knees, come on
[Hook x2]
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Aww naww, big Slim Dogg
Eighty pound balls, dick six inch long
Back up in the heezy, baby
He's Shady
 
(he's so crazy)
Gimme the mic, let me recite til Timothy White
Pickets outside the Interscope offices every night
What if he's right
I'm just a criminal
 
making a living off of the world's misery
What in the world gives me the right
To say what I like,
 
and walk around flipping the bird
Livin' the urban life, like a White kid from the burbs
Dreaming at night of screaming at mom, scheming to leave
Run away from home and grow to be as evil as me
I just want you all to notice me and people to see
That somewhere deep down there's a decent human being in me
It just can't be found, so the reason you've been seeing this me
Is cause this is me now, the recent dude who's being this mean
So when you see me, dressin' up like a nerd on TV
Or heard the CD using the fag word so freely
It's just me being me, here want me to tone it down
Suck my fucking dick, you faggot, you happy now?
Look here, I start some trouble everywhere that I go
Ask the bouncers in the club cause they know
I start some shit they throw me out the back door
Come back and shoot the club up with a 44
[Hook]
[Outro: Xzibit]
2001 and forever
Slim Shady
Dr. Dre
Snoop Dogg
X to the Z
Nate Dogg
Come on, yeah

[Zoe on telephone]
Justin?
It's Zoe um
Kelly did not have me call however I just listened to Eminem in her car and
It is the most DISGUSTING thing I have ever heard in my entire life
And I seriously wanna call his fucking agent
And tell him how FUCKING disgusting he is
It like makes me upset
I'm now nauseous and I can't eat lunch
Goodbye

[Verse 1]
Sneaking in through the back door
, 
fruity MCs get ambushed
Rammed and squooshed, slammed and pushed, crammed and mushed
Then I'm moving on down from the right to left
So bite the meth or prepare to fight to death
To get jacked, attacked and cracked in two
Smacking through 'til youre black and blue, for acting true
I'm dreaded like a man whose hair is all strands
Crews battle me sniffin' on aerosol cans
I'm stomping, I'm kicking, I'm choking, I'm stamping 'em
Clomping 'em, sticking, and poking and clamping 'em
To electric chairs and tightening bolts
Hit 'em with frightening jolts of lightning bolts
I'm zapping rappers, singers and dancers
Faster than you can snap your figures for answers
Cancer is in the flesh, alive and breathing
Surviving by conniving and thieving
[Verse 2]
I had a dream I was getting jacked by biters
It felt like I was being attacked by spiders
Developing a fear of biterphobia
I'm holding a gas can and lighter over ya
If I detect ya, I'mma pulverize
Dissect your brain, digging in your skull for lies
And I'mma torture, with material iller
Than a stark raving mad serial killer
I'm more dangerous than a loaded chamber is
A major risk to a plagiarist
So beware of the aura,
 
a terror for the horrible
Will scare ya tomorrow,
 is the airborne assault
Of the rappers, 
hit the source to better my skills
I head for the border,
 
and run the
 
Galloping Hills
The choice is yours
 
cause now buddy's noises force me
To scream 'til my voice is hoarse
Cause I'm sick of these jabber jaws and crap
That grab at yours and savage yours to bite like labradors
In the range of my double-barrel
And your life is in danger, trouble and peril
[Verse 3]
I trample and stamp liars, like they were campfires
Cuz vampires bite on my balls, and clamp pliers
And swing on my big thingamajig
So I'm bringing my nig' Proof for backup when I sing at my gig
Cause biters are falling head over heels
In love with every rhyme that I've said over reels
That's how I became paranoid
Chewing my fingernails, pulling my hair annoyed
Cause every time you bit it was deliberate
So I'm forced to hit a little quicker with
An ultimatum
 
I assault and
 
slayed 'em
With rhymes and
 
it's ultimatum just to cultivate 'em
Energetic and imaginative
Pronouns and verbs, predicates and adjectives
Will reach out and grab ya, 9 times outta 10
That's why I'm spilling one of a kind rhymes out a pen

[Eminem]
Yo yo yo yo
Schizophrenia, how many of ya got it?
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
How many motherfuckers can say they brain dry-rotted from pot?
You got it like I got it or not?
If you did, you would know just what I'm talking bout
When your tongue's rotting out from cotton-mouth
When you end up becoming so dependent on weed
That you end up spending a G in the vending machine
You got the munchies
, 
look at you, junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat
, 
up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
That's it gotcha thinking the whole world is watching ya
Or maybe you don't smoke
, 
maybe you just roll
But whatever your drug's yo, go for the
 
gusto
Just don't, come fuck with me when I'm doing my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fucking my high up

[Eminem]
Bizarre sit yo' nasty ass down!
[Bizarre]
I spot this fat bitch from across the room
Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom
 (yea yea!)
My face is pink, looking for a sink
And don't worry bout what I put in your drink
It's called a date-rape drug,
 
ten minutes you'll be fucked up
Open your nasty-ass legs up (yeah you whore)
Bitches I'm catching, blunts I'm matching
Don't call me Bizarre, I'm the Reverend 
Jesse Jackson
[Swift]
Who the fuck is this guy, why the hell you in my presence?
It'd be cool if you was asking me some reasonable questions
But you on some bullshit nigga, this yo' last beer
 (
f'real
)
Get the fuck off my dick
 
and tell yo' bitch to bring here ass here
I kick a ho out without giving her cabfare
And leave her barefooted just for nagging in my damn ear
When I'm out eating, you fags'll interfere
They don't go until I let 'em know a mag' is sitting here
I get drunk and I smoke weed, whatcho' ass wanna hear?
I didn't answer you clear, 
I met Manson this year

You want some yay?

But other than that, get the hell out my face

[Kuniva] 
Aww, man you probably lead her on
[Kon Artis] I just bought her a beer!
[Kuniva] I saw her rubbing on your head while she was wiping your tears
[Kon Artis] 
I admit, I was high, but you ain't seen me crying
[Kuniva] Nigga,

[Kon Artis] 
Well at least somebody in this bar is, this big bitch did
The ultimate by saying she wanted to have my kids
[Kuniva] 
Look man you grown, just leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Call it a night, get stoned, and take that fat slut home
Just drink the drink,
 
hit the dank,

Go kill yourself
[Kon Artis] 
Fuck you!
[Kuniva] Well, stop blowing my buzz

I'm at the front of the bar by the lounge in the back
With a slut on my arm while I'm downing the

Got the pills in my system

Every time I start

[Outro: Kon Artis]
We'll be cool
We'll be cool if you don't talk while I'm just trying to smoke my weed
Smoke my weed

While I'm just trying to get blowed
Spitting to me some mo'.. (hehehe)

[Confusion]
Yo, B-Rabbit? Ha

[B-Rabbit]
Alright look

Battling this chick…
With no breast
And why I gotta battle a chick
Especially one that’s wack…
With a dick
So you a dope MC?
Don’t get mad and start taking your period out on me
Cause I ain’t done shit to you
What’s your name confusion
Well then I guess I gotta confuse you
This ain’t something I’m used to
Why the fuck did Future even introduce you
I really don’t understand
Why this chick is up her right now who wants to be a man
On this mic is rat-a-tat-tat
Why the fuck am I up here battling Da Brat
You don’t even really wanna see this
On this microphone I will eat your fuckin fetus. Yo!

[Lotto]
I'll spit a racial slur, honky sue me
The shit is a horror flick
But a black guy doesn't die in this movie
You messin' with Lotto, dawg you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gon' feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joinin' the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck "Lotto", call me "Your Leader"
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from Leave It To Beaver
I used to like that show
Now, you got me in fight back mode
But, oh well, if you gotta go, then you gotta go
I hate to do this, I would love for this shit to last
So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And all's well, that ends OK
So I'll end this shit with a fuck you and have a nice day
[B-Rabbit]
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the beaver
So was Eddie Haskell, Wally, and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin', he's paranoid
Quick! Someone get his ass another steroid
Blah Badi Boo Blah Bah Badi Blo Blah
I ain't hear a word you said: hipidi hoo blah!
Is that a tank top or a new bra?
Look! Snoop Dogg just got a fuckin' boob job
Didn't you listen to the last round, meathead?
Pay attention! You're sayin' the same shit that he said
Matter of fact, dawg, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
And don't come back until somethin' dope hits you
Fuck it, you can take the mic home with you
Lookin' like a cyclone hit you
Tank top screamin
', 
"Lotto! I don't fit you!"
You see how far the white jokes get you
Boys like, "How vanilla ice gon' diss you?"
My motto: Fuck Lotto
I'll get the seven digits from your mother for a dollar tomorrow

(Verse 1: Lotto)
I'll spit a racial slur
, 
honky sue me
This shit is a horror flick, but the black guy doesn't die in this movie
Fucking with Lotto? Dawg, you gotta be kiddin'
That makes me believe you really don't have an interest in livin'
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?
I've got a better chance joining the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck "Lotto," call me your leader
I feel bad that I gotta murder that dude from "Leave it to Beaver"

So I'll end this shit with a "Fuck you" and "Have a nice day!"
(Verse 2: B-Rabbit)
Ward, I think you were a little hard on the Beaver

This guy keeps screaming, he's paranoid
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid

Pay attention, you're sayin the same shit that he said
Matter of fact dawg, here's a pencil

[Lyckety Splyt]
This guy's a choke artist
, 
ya catch a bad one
You're better off shooting yourself with Papa Doc's handgun
Climbing up this mountain you're weak
I'll leave you lost without a paddle, floating shit's creek
You ain't Detroit, I'm the D
You're the new kid on the block
Bout to get smacked back to the boondocks
Fucking Nazi, this crowd ain't your type
Take some real advice and
 
form a group with Vanilla Ice
And what I tell you, you better use it
This guy's a hillbilly, this ain't Willie Nelson music
Trailer trash, I'll choke you to your last breath
And have you looking foolish
Like Cheddar Bob when he shot himself
Silly Rabbit, I know why they call you that
Cause you follow Future like you got carrots up his ass crack
And when you acting up that's when you got jacked up
And left stupid like Tina Turner when she got smacked up
I'll crack your shoulder blade
You'll get dropped so hard Elvis will start turning in his grave
I don't know why they let you out in the dark
You need to take your white ass back across 8 Mile
To the trailer park
[B-Rabbit]
This guy raps like his parents jerked him
He sounds like Erick Sermon, the generic version
This whole crowd looks suspicious
It's all dudes in here, except for these bitches
So I'm a German, eh?
That's ok, you look like a fuckin' worm with braids
These Leaders of the Free World rookies
Lookie, how can 6 dicks be pussies
Talking bout shits creek
Bitch, you could be up piss creek with paddles this deep
You're still gonna sink
, 
you're a disgrace
Yeah, they call me Rabbit this is a turtle race
He can't get with me spitting this shit
Wickedly lickety shot
Suspicious spickety split lickety
So I'm gonna turn around with a great smile
And walk my white ass back across 8 Mile

[Marv One]
Yo yo, y'all ready for death?
Y'all ready for death?
Marv One the fat killer
The game done got ugly
Let's go
Yo, yo
I seen your type before, you think you're tough
Battle you?
Bitch, you lucky I don't beat you up
In a game of fisticuffs, I'll push your face back
You can't fuck with me, man
Really, just face facts
It's him verses me, in a battle of ten rounds
It's like Muggsy Bogues tryin' to fuck with Jim Brown
Dumb fuck, I'm the type to run amok
Come in the club drunk as fuck
Slap your bitch so we can buck
One hook...
Type of a man the size of Dan Dierdorf
Tryin' to take his ear off like Mike Tyse
I'm quite nice on fight nights
And why he poppin' shit?
I thought he liked life?
Apparently not
I'm incoherently hot
And if I miss you
Then your parents'll be shot
Yo I'm a bad boy, bitch it's on
I'll put 44's in your chest like you Rick Mahorn
[B-Rabbit]
Hold on faggot, let me turn this mic on
Don't think for a minute I'm gon' let you get away with that song
That shit was wack, you ain't spittin'
As a matter of fact, all of that shit was written
And I know it wasn't for me, surely, you really must adore me
,
Now look it
Yo, you might as well move  to Italy
Look, this guy's ripped...*skkkrr* Literally
You don't wanna really fuck wit this
On this microphone, I'm not Snuffleupagus
But I don't give a fuck,
 
you can keep that dull rap
And turn your ass back around
 
with your fuckin skullcap
And your bandana or your motherfuckin sweatband
Fuckin' with this style, you're a dead man
I ain't Redman, but on this mic, yo, I pick it up
Just like your face when I had to rip it up
You don't wanna see me
Yo, uh

[Unknown]
The Shelter
Let me get up in this nigga like smashin'
With a red beam Johny blastin'
Evil is the rhyme assassin
Get a guy runnin', like haulin' ass
Bury you pink rabbits for askin'
Closed caption nigga don't say a word
When these flames get to burnin' up
Burnin' you down
Leavin' you ground tore up
From the pressure
Wanna frown
Don't want the nigga known pullin' triggers
Hoist this fool on my neck back-break this nigga
[B-Rabbit]
Check it out
Look, look
I gotta flow, I'm from the Mo
You ain't Detroit, ho
Talkin' about seven mile
Change your style
I read your bio
You're really from Ohio
I'm vile
This guy's so fuckin' fat
I can't even see his eyes when he smiles
Yo, listen to this motherfuckin' rhyme
Yo chicken, we can do this
As a matter of fact have another beer
I'll be right back, dawg
I'ma set the mic right here

[Intro]
[Doctor] Scalpel
[Nurse] Here
[Doctor] Sponge
[Nurse] Here
[Doctor] Wait...he's convulsing, he's convulsing
[Nurse] Ah
[Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him
[Nurse] Oh my! Oh my God
[Doctor] We're gonna have to shock him
[Nurse] Oh my God
[Verse 1]
These are the results
 
of a thousand electric volts
A neck with bolts
(Nurse we're losing him, check the pulse)
A kid who refused to respect adults
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose
A corny looking White boy
Scrawny and always ornery
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies picking on me
And I might snap, one day just like that
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack
My first day in junior high
 
this kid said
It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die
I looked at my watch it was 1:20
I already gave you my lunch money
What more do you want from me
He said, don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse
My palms were sweaty
And I started to shake at first
Something told me, try to fake a stomach ache, it works
I screamed, oww, my appendix feels like they could burst
Teacher, teacher,
 
quick I need a naked nurse
"What's the matter"
I don't know, my leg, it hurts
"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"
Oh I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"
But don't you wanna give me after school detention
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'mma let him"
[Hook x2]
Brain damage
Ever since the day I was born
Drugs is what they used to say I was on
They say I never knew which way I was going
But everywhere I go they keep playing my song
[Verse 2]
Way before my baby daughter Hailie
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey
An eighth grader
 
who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes
So every day he'd shove me in the lockers
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissing
And had me in the position to beat me into submission
He banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose
Soaked my clothes in blood
Grabbed me and choked my throat
I tried to plead and tell him
We shouldn't beef
But he just wouldn't leave
He kept choking me and I couldn't breathe
He looked at me and said, "you gonna die, honky"
The principal walked in, and started helping him stomp me
I made them think they beat me to death
Holding my breath for like five minutes before they finally left
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools
This is for every time you took my
 
orange juice
Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt
I'm gettin you back bully
Now once and for good
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could
And beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood
Knocked him down
Stood on his chest with one foot
Made it home, later that same day
Started reading a comic
 
and suddenly everything became gray
I couldn't even see what I was trying to read
I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed
My mother started screaming, "what are you on, drugs"
Look at you, you're getting blood all over my rug
 (
sorry
)
She beat me over the head with the remote control
Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull
I picked it up and screamed
Look bitch, what have you done
Oh my God, I'm sorry son
Shut up you cunt
I said fuck it
Took it and stuck it back up in my head
Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck
[Hook]

[Intro]
Eminem has a full line of chainsaws
Eminem, Eminem, Eminem, Eminem
Marshall Mathers, Eminem... the rapper Eminem
"Who can say for sure?
 
Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society would reap a great benefit."
[Verse 1]
I walk around like a space cadet,
 
place your bets
Who's likely to become a serial killer,
 
case of Tourettes
Fuck, fuck-fuck,
 
can't take the stress
I make a mess as the day progresses
Angry and take it out on the neighbors hedges
Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches
With these hedge trimming scissors with razor edges
Imagination's dangerous, it's
The only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation I guess
Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's
Despicable, I'm sick of just gettin' pushed, it's ridiculous
I look like a freakin' wuss, a pussy, this kid just took
My stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush
I wanna kick his tush, but I was six and shook
This fucker was twelve and was six foot, with a vicious hook
He hit me, I fell; I got back up, all I did was book
Now there's using your head
Momma always said
[Hook]
If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous - a brain, you'd be dangerous
I'ma prove you wrong
Momma, I'mma grow one day to be famous, and I'mma be a pain in the anus
I'ma be the bomb
I'ma use my head as a weapon,
 
find a way to escape this insaneness
Momma always said,
 
"Son, if you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"
Guess it pays to be brainless
[Verse 2]
Fast forward some years later, a teenager; this is fun, sweet
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete
It's usually once a month, this is some feat
I've accomplished,
 
they've stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason, you stumped me
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down and be upbeat
 
when you don't have nothing?
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed
Cause you're doomed from the start,
 
it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street
But if I could just get my head out my ass
I could accomplish any task
Practicing trash talkin'
In a trance
 
locked in my room, yeah, but I got some plans, Momma
These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it
And I'm starting to blend in more
In school this shit helps for sure
I'm getting more self-assured than I've ever been before
Plus no one picks on me anymore,
 
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch - end of story
Still in my skull is a vacant empty void, been using it more as a bin for storage
Take some inventory
In this gourd there's a Ford engine,
 
door hinge, syringe,
 
an orange,
 
an extension cord, and a Ninja sword, not to mention four linchpins an astringent stored
Ironing board, a bench, a wrench an oru winch,
 
an attention whore
Everything but a brain,
 
but dome's off the fucking chain like an independent store
Something's wrong with my head
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't, cause I'd probably be Dahmer,
 cause Momma always said
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Now my Mom goes wahm-wahm-wahm
Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb
I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped
But somehow, I came out on top
[Verse 3]
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo
I'm nice, yo, fuck it, I'm out cold
Now everywhere I go they scream out go,
 
I'm 'bout to clean house, yo
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household
Outsold the sell-outs,
 
freak the hell out Middle America, hear 'em yell out in terror they were so scared
 
and those kids
Just about,
 
belted out
 
whatever spouted or fell out of my smart aleck mouth, it was so weird
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as
Mothafucking difficult, ch-yeah, 'til then,
 
hopefully ya
Little homos get over your fears and phobias
It's okay to be scared straight,
 
they said I provoke queers
'Til emotions evoke tears,
 
my whole career's
A stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah
You mothafuckin' (insert insult here)
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little ole MC'd
Be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?
And boy, they did flock; can't believe this little hick locked
This hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got
That white trash traffic in gridlock,
 
shit hopping like six blocks
From a Kid Rock, Insane Clown Posse Concert in mid Oc-
-Tober,
 
and God forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all, cause
I'll turn into the Unabomber,
 Momma always said
[Hook]
[Outro]
Insaneness ain't even a word, you stupid fuck
Neither is ain't

Briefcase Joe
]
Yeah this is going out
To those two yerks
From Junior High School
Who called me Briefcase Joe
Guess what?
Now It's come to past that
It's turned out to be a good thing for me
[Verse 1: Briefcase Joe]
(
Yeah, tell 'em
)
Yo here I go
They call me Briefcase Joe
I write my lyrics down
For a keepsake, yo
On the microphone
Here's the beats they go
You could be the rapper
I'm the DJ, yo
My lyrics just erupt like a volcano
Everywhere I walk
When I talk they know
I flippin' it, dippin' it
Trippin' it, rippin' it
Hit 'em with venom in 'em
I gave them an enema
Then hit 'em up
Right in front of the cinema
Skin them alive
{Rocking the party}
As soon as the women arrive
Then Imma drive a stake in their heart (yeah)
And squirt (yeah)
Lemon in their eyes
You know what I'm sayin'?
[Hook: Eminem]
Chicka, Chicka, Chicka, Chicka
Briefcase Joe
They called him, they called him
They called him  Briefcase Joe
Chicka, Chicka
His name is
His name is Briefcase Joe
He don't carry that briefcase to the school no more
Chicka
[Verse 2: Briefcase Joe]
My testicles
Are vegetables
They're going to Mexico
They're on a jet-jetroll, yo
[Hook: Eminem]

Broke the rubber
Busted a nut up in your mother
So how do you feel about having another little brother
Nasty motherupper
Talking trash like a trucker
Snatch your bitch up out of your track
Smacked her up and fucked her
Always talking shit high
Smoking chocolate Thai
You all can die
Just by walking by giving an awkward eye
I've lost my motherfreaking marbles
Smelling like a brewery
Jewelling at the way your jewellery sparkles
Head full of charcoals
Smoked out brain particles
Burning holes in clothes articles
A retarded fool since I started school
Burned the weed before I learned to read
Disregarded rules
Skipping classes to blaze the blunt ashes
Kissing front dashes and smashing up cars like stunt crashes
Hall passes for restrooms
Chewing mushrooms
Doing rush fumes in the lunch room
Looking nervous
Liquor in my thermos
Hung with hermits that carry guns without permits
Staring at the bitch with firm tits
Jacking off
Aiming straight for both lips when my sperm spits

[20 seconds of background noise]
"It fits, perfect"
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Better watch out,
 
sucka, now I got ya where I want ya
Onslaught, coming and I'm packing in my lunch up
Bunch of, missile launchers and a bunch of contra-
-band,
 
van full of ganja,
 
now come on jump
Man stop, moshing Marshall, oh my god ya
Doing the cha-cha and the cucaracha with a quadra-
-plegic,
 
boogieing down to Frank Sinatra
Lindsay to the Lohan naked while you let me watch ya
Who'da knew the Buddha do to me what it's done
Such cynicism when this isn't in my system
Blunt hypnotism,
 
lift the spliff up to my lips son
So much on my hands I got to give my kids a fist bump
Christo-pher Reeves swimming in my swim trunks
"Mister, help me" is what he said to me and then sunk
Women skinning and then cutting them up in chunks
In comes the woman with cocoa butter skin once
[Hook: Eminem]
Once again they call me Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
Skin 'em up, hem 'em, sew 'em up
 
in those kilts
Up in those kilts, uppa-up in those kilts
Man you don't want to go up in those hills
Up in those hills, uppa-up in those hills
You better beware, stay clear of Buffalo Bill
Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Always, you can see him lurking in the hallways
Carcasses of Caucasian females in his crawl space
How the hell did he fit 'em all into such a small place
Hide 'em in the wall, well how long will the drywall take?
Well fuck it then, I got nothing but time, I'll wait
Until it dries for the moment I guess you're all safe
After I sand it and buff it, I guess that I'll paint
My chainsaw's out of gas, my regular saw ain't
Now here I come again, damn stomach rumbling
You can even hear the evil spirits coming from within
Someone's in, the back of my damn house rummaging
It's a girl, she looks pretty thin, but I want to skin
Been, on the hunt again; when, will it ever end?
Evelyn, why you tryna fight? You will never win
Severing, legs, arms, damn there goes another limb
Pull the lever then, trapdoor, death is evident
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now what you know about Buffalo Bill? Nothing, so chill
Fucking whore, you better fucking hold still
Make sure none of that lotion in the bucket don't spill
Cut 'em, gut 'em and just keep to stuffing those girls
Man I think she had enough of those pills
Sedate her then I'll wait,
 
I'll come back later just to clutch on those steel
Blades, baby when I cut ya don't squeal
I hate the loud noises, I fucking told you!
I keep hearing voices like wouldn't ya like to go and get your butcher knife
And push it right through her while you put ya shish-kabob skewers
Into her, barbecue her or would you do to her
What you usually do to a girl who's skin's newer?
"In a world of sin you are, this is turning into a
Torment tournament of sorts, Christmas ornament you are!"
I'll be sure to Ginsu ya,
 
'til there's no more skin to ya, boo-yah
Who ya think you're fucking with, duck because here he comes again
[Hook]

[Bugz]
Fuck that!
Who run shit once these drums hit?
You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip, for you to come get
Your clique made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas, is who you run wit
Making half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate your damn sound, don't like it one bit!
You could make a double album, won't have one hit!
Your entire outfit is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad-mit, that my style is unfit
For momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
This egotistic hip-hop fundamentalistic
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bend shit
Smoke the blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Your bitch pay my bill, that's where the hell your rent went
Fuck that!

[Intro]
Yo, check it out, it's fucked up, and I don't see either one of us budging
[Verse 1]
"I'm withholding my anger
Though I'd like to be the strangler
Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck
It's my right to insist
That he acknowledge my existence
But he just displays complete lack of respect"
That's what he says to himself
As he use his magazines to trash me
As he sits with both his feet up at his desk
Smokes a bag of his weed
And starts imagining things
And he just can't see that he's manically depressed
And in his jealousy and envy
It just whirls him in a frenzy
As he turns on MTV and sees my face
He don't exist in this world
So he just twists and he twirls
Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage
And it's destroying him slowly
Cause he does not even know me
Even though he sees me everywhere he goes
So he just tortures himself
He has no fortune and wealth
So he extorts someone else to get his dough
And now he's acting like a bully
So he tries to push and pull me
But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad
He has no choice but to scream
And raise his voice up at me
Cause it annoys him to see that I ain't scared
[Hook]
You ain't no motherfucking (bully)
And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully)
I won't allow it, ain't gonna cower to no (bully)
I'll be damned if I don't stand up to a (bully)
Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully...)
And I know it must be fucking with you emotionall(y...)
[Verse 2]
Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies
No more unfortunately
There's so many other motherfuckers that just are
They just keep hounding at me
Now that I'm down with 50
Suddenly now I got beef with this faggot Ja [laughter]
But his ass is such a puppet
Irv could shove his whole hand up it
And just make him say what he wants him to say
But Suge has Irv's on a string
And Irv's so nervous that he
Says anything to this man to keep him at bay
So now Ja thinks that he's so tough
And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf
And they go huff and puff and blow our label down
But our building's made out of bricks
So you ain't taking out shit
And dog you just did a song with Bobby Brown
So now you try to pull a race card
And it backfires in your face hard
Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit
Plus this stylist that you fucked
When you was ecstasied up
Was just a man who's dressed up as a white bitch
[Hook]
You must be taking to much (E...)
[Verse 3]
Now what bothers me the most
About hip-hop is we so close
To picking up where we left off with Big and Pac
We just lost
 
Jam Master J
Big L got blasted away
Plus we lost 
Bugs
, 
Slang Ton
, and 
Freaky Ta
It's like a never-ending cycle
That just seems to come full circle
Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard
I'm not excluding myself
Cause I been stupid as well
I been known to lose it when someone says something smart
But as we grow as men
We learn to let shit go, but then again
There's only so much bullshit we can really stand
We all got reps to uphold
When someone steps on our toes
It's no exception, it goes for every man
But if Irv really gave a fuck
About Ja like he claims he does
He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs
But he just keeps feeding him pills
So if that E doesn't kill him
Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed
Dawg, I'm talking to you straight
If the situation escalates
Any worse, we're gonna lose another soldier to this game
And if I get killed for this rap
I got a million in cash
That says I will get you back in Halie's name
[Hook]
Irvine, get your boy off that (E...)
[Spoken]
Get at me, dog
Holla

Black Cotton
Black Cotton
Black Cotton
 - 
A symbol for unrewarded struggle
Time for a little gospel tale
Ghetto gospel that is- listen
Rotten Black Cotton in God's eyes
Speak
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Black Cotton
Steady stressin' 
Smith and Wessons
 count my blessin's
Class is in session: the worst question is the first question
Why do we work like slaves sweatin' blades to an early grave
Never got paid but still we slave
 
(In the nine tre')
Answer that then answer this too-
Love's gonna get ya you know it's true life's a bitch true
You best to backtrack and try to act black and live
Not to be phony and positive but why be negative?
What's the matter G? Black cat got your tongue
Fat track gotcha sprung now your hung (Do ya feel me?)
Dum dum diddy is it me?
Attempt to reach each and every brother on the streets
If not peace then at least let's get a piece
I'm tired of seeing bodies on the streets
- 
deceased
Lookin' through my highschool yearbook
Reminiscin' of the tears as the years took
One homie, two homie, three homies - POOF
We used to have troops but now there's no more youth to shoot
God come save the misbegotten
Lost ghetto souls of Black Cotton (In God's eyes)
[Hook: Eminem]
Nobody don't care
(No matter how hard I try, look to the sky, and I ask God why)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my dreams, drowned in by screams, no answer to my questions)
Nobody don't care
(Feels like I'm pressed, why do I stress? It's like I'm being tested)
Nobody don't care
(Seems like my prayers vanish to thin air, please answer my questions)
Nobody don't care
[Verse 2: Kastro]
In the belly of the beast I'm bubbling up
Running out of luck, about to self destruct
Old heads say live your life like such
You're sure to catch her witcha one day boy
I wouldn't listen to 'em
Your power movement was cool
But it ain't fix nothin'
So I just go with what I know
I don't trust none
Look what the 80's did
To us baby kids
And now we grown up
Nobody ain't own us yet
[Verse 3: Young Noble]
Black cotton, I'm plottin' on what they owe me
I'm workin' without a profit
They shacklin' all my homies
I'm hurtin' but keep the mind
And we ain't stop, it's curtains, you try to rise and
Certainly we survive with Outlaw Ridas
What's the reward for a struggler
If the lord loving us then why they hate to see us comin' up
Running up, gun cocked, black mask and gloves
If you ain't got a penny, mind the glove
No love
Waitin' for my 
40 acres and a blunt
 to blaze
Biblical times good hearts with milita minds
Black Cotton - 
I'm hoppin' over enemy lines
Black Cotton - 
I ain't stoppin' till they givin me mine
Black Cotton

[Intro: Missy Elliott]
Slim Shady
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Well I do pop pills
I keep my tube socks filled
And pop the same shit that got 2Pac killed
Spit game to these hoes
Like a soap opera episode
And punch a bitch in the nose til her whole face explodes
There's three things I hate
Girls, women and bitches
I'm that vicious to walk up and drop-kick midgets
They call me Boogie Night
The stalker that walks awkward
Stick figure with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg
Coming through the airport
Sluggish, walking on crutches
Hit a fucking {pregnant bitch} in her {stomach} with luggage
It's like a dream I can't snap out
I black out, I'm back out
I'm lookin for someone "of" to beat the crap out
I'm bringing you rap singers two middle fingers
I flip you off in French
Then translate in English
Then I'mma vanish off the face of the planet and come back
Speaking so much Spanish, 
Pun can't even understand it
[Hook: Missy Elliott]
Won't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim Shady
Won't you busa rhyme for me boy, Slim motherfucking Shady
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I had a huge attitude, started off staticky
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity
Who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world
Full of url, head twirls every time the toilet swirls
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up
I made this rap game suspenseful,
 cause now I got a impulse
To give you insults wrote with a pencil
And waste the paper on you
Chopping down the oakwood
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cutting
You motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nothing
[Hook]
[Bridge: Missy Elliott]
Turn the music up, we gone wake the neighbors
We gone get high, we gone roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady on some shit daily
What you want, what you got
Is it hot, is it hot
Turn the music up, we gone wake the neighbors
We gon' get high, we gone roll to Vegas
Me and Slim Shady, on some shit daily
What you want, what you want
A person from another planet might disagree with you
Well if you want my opinion, it comes from right here on Earth
[Interlude]
Slim Shady, Misdemeanor
Timbaland
Slim Shady, Misdemeanor
[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm homicidal and suicidal with no friends
Holding a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends
Spraying
 
tecs at you
 
until you see your fucking legs
With the bullet holes and the exit wounds laying next to you
Fucking mad dog, foaming at the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foaming at the couch
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building
And shot every window out on the way down to the ground, keep filming
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped 'em in half
Suffocated the oxygen mask
Shit, if I get any higher
I'mma get the East and West beefing again
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire
[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
Y'all better call the police 'fore I kill this track
Don't shoot Missy, get back
I'mma put you all in the line and I'mma watch you MC's die
Yo Mommy, Mommy, Missy done lost her mind
I think somebody done pissed her off this time
I'mma have to bust you through your chest and
You gone have to clean up the mess
It's raining, raining and it's pouring loud
Never fear, cause pissy Missy's through the crowd
I hear the gats go cha-pow
Who shot me dammit, bitch get down
Don't walk when I talk, I never talk when I smile
Lay em on down, like they lived underground
For the sound that me and Timbaland, we found
Get your ass kicked later or get your ass kicked now
[Outro]
Uhh, one-two Misdemeanor, Slim Shady, Timbaland, motherfucker
Uhh uhh uhh, two, two, two, triple zero

Bitches and gentlemen!

Hurry hurry, step right up!
Introducin the star of our show.. his name is

You wouldn't want to be anywhere else in the world right now
So without further ado,
 I bring to you

[Verse 1: Eminem]
You bout to witness, hip-hop in its most purest
Most rawest form,
 
flow almost flawless
Most hardest,
 
most honest known artist
Chip off the old block, but old Doc is back
Looks like Batman brought his own Robin
Oh God, Saddam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm rooms doors 
off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pears, plums, syringes
{*chainsaw sound*} VRINN VRINN
 
Yeah, here I come
I'm inches, away from you, dear fear none
Hip-hop is in a state of 9-1-1 so
[Hook: Eminem]
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around, what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the shit down
On these clowns;
 can I get a witness? 
(HELL YEAH!)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Quick gotta move fast, 
gotta perform miracles
Gee wilikers Dre,
 
"Holy bat syllables!"
Look at all the bullshit that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone,
 time to get rid of these 
rap criminals
So 
skip to your lou while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more; you're used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it but still everybody knows the shit
The most hated on out of all those who say they get hated on
In eighty songs and exaggerate it all so much
They make it all up, there's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you're rappin and you know what for
The show must go on;
 
so I'd like to welcome y'all
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
C'mon! Now..
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's just like old times,
 
the Dynamic Duo
Two old friends, why panic? You already know
Who's fully capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center, eight-zero-zero
You can even call collect,
 
the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, played career Russian Roulette
And never even see me blink or get to bustin a sweat
People steppin over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see an MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats and be so breezy
Jesus how can shit be so easy?
How can one Chandra be so Levy?
Turn on these beats, MC's don't see me
Believe me; 
BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave dog, fo' sheezy
Can't leave rap alone, the game needs me
'til we grow beards, get weird and disappear
Into the mountains
 - 
nothin but clowns down here
But we, ain't fuckin around round here
Yo Dre (whattup?) Can I get a "hell yeah"? (HELL YEAH!) Now
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
So there you have it folks (Marshall!) has come to save the day
Back with his friend 
Andre
, 
here to remind you that bullshit does not pay
Because (Marshall!) and Andre are here to stay
And never go away, until our dying day
Until we're old and grey
 (Marshall!)
So until next time friends, same blonde hair, same rap channel
Good night everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening (Marshall!)
Oh! Heh

[Intro: Eminem]
OHH! Stat Quo! Here we go!
C'mon, c'mon! You ready? (heh)
Let's do it man (uh uh uh uh-uhh)
Shady Aftermath
Sound, without focus, is just noise
[
Stat Quo
] + (Eminem)
Yeah (where you get that thang man)
 {By my side}
When you do somethin to somebody umm {By my side}
It ain't just you it's somebody next to you {By my side}

(Okay) So being that that's the case {By my side}
Let me tell you about {By my side}
That place, heh, take you by my side {By my side}
[Stat Quo]
The way I growed up, sho' nuff, chips on my shoulder
Knew about that cola when I was in a stroller
But came ahold of choppin them boulders gettin older
Wantin a Rover
, ducked in them rows meetin quotas
Shorty bipolar, load her by cock I tried to told ya
When movin the wrong direction ain't no flesh and then it's over
You on that doja, G.I. Joe shit but you ain't a soldier
Chopper or fold ya, you not cobra commander, you bozo
I'm the composer, writer of murder,
 
the odor
Leakin out of your body, temperature is gettin colder
But you sweatin and dizzy like a person who ain't sober
Realizin your life is comin quickly to a closure
Losin composure, out of breath like you underwater
Twenty seconds in the game, and it's the fourth quarter
Primetime, "
Dateline
" are the best exposure
Now you're still, on the news and everybody knows ya
Yeahhhh, YEA!
[Hook]
By, my, side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they won't forget me it's - by my side
To all the niggas tryin to get me it's - by my side
I'm takin some of y'all with me it's - by my side
I'm makin sure they don't forget me it's - by my side
Ye-yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh; by my side (ooh)
[Stat Quo]
Go now boy, get your vest, protect yo' neck, kill for fun
Watch how they run and scatter when I go and pull out my gun (gun)
Call me ignorant and young, psycho sicko negro
They know that I just fuck and be gone (gone)
Drivin crazy halfway dumb
Don't stop even when the law come, believe every word out my lungs
I'm losin it, snappin huh, this ain't just no rappin uh
Back all the way back when you see that strap cause it go ra-tata-ta
Are you ready to die tell me why you choose to tell me in my
Face, have your body dry, pack that fire, look in my eye
Have your spirit below me or floatin in the fuckin sky
All black is my attire, lookin like a umpire
Toss you in the trash like a bullshit album flop
Yeah yeah ye-yeah ye-yeahhhh, YEA!
[Hook]
[Stat Quo]
The murder capital mo' mayhem, yes it's thriller
Put four in your head, have you floatin off in a river
It's cold, you shook, we crooks, your body'll quiver
These rappers so tough but really they softer than pillows
Or chinchilla or Twinkie filler, hone of a realer
They turn to serial assassins for some scrilla
Now me could see I mean him, yes this nigga
Stays true to what I do cause I keeps it realer
Be for real, have you ever ever pulled a trigger?
It's serious business shorty, nothin is more iller
No discrimination, you could be chocolate or vanilla
And find yourself in the presence of a fuckin killer
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeahhhh, YEA!
[Hook]
By my side, by my side {*blam*}
[Eminem]
It's "The Re-Up"

Turn my mic up
Turn my mic up
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the right) Ayo, calm down nigga
(Steady on the left) Fuck it, blackout niggas!
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh my lord
, 
lower the casket down
Sprinkle the ash,
 
or get your 
 kicked, pow!
Frown while I shit on your crown,
 
skip town
Ground zero, shapiro the king cash cow
Do I make 'em say 'Wow!',
 
strip, ow, bow
I sit with the pound,
 
click, pow
Blow, click, click, pow, click, pow
Stop traffic dropping them classics, flip now
Bitches I’m making them skip with thou
Art, you don’t really want start when I growl
(rawr, rawr, rawr)
 
let me come and mop up the knock offs
When I pop off and never stop, cause
When we do come through, you better lock doors (PAUSE)
The wolves wanna eat, peep how they lockjaws
No need to cook up the coke, you see we cop raw
And if you ain’t had enough
What in the fat fishes of a phenomenal Fahrvergnügen fuck is going on?
Back with the B.A Baracus callous
, 
bang on another song I’mma have these niggas nervous
And clipping they nails and dribbling and witness them
Nibble them like sunflower seed shells
Set these scales got my weight up heavy like three whales
And I shit on these males ‘til it's stinkin' fouler than a weed smell
Nigga your tree fell
See how they Twitter, Facebook and Instagramming a email
Talking,
 
I’m sick, I got them shook and I bang em at retail
Until they cripple
,
 
see I cook like I’m slanging a weed sale
Until I triple bread and whoop ‘em and drag 'em like females (gasp)
Oh see well, these niggas already know
The way that I fuck shit up, minus the details
The case is shut
Your bitch remind me of replacement butt kind of an ancient slut
It's going down like she was a basement fuck
Swell up this shit like I’m sticking steaks in they gut
So gracefully and graciously, I painfully wake niggas up
Ragdolling these niggas and attacking like apes in the cut
I’m waiting for the taking while I break niggas neck like a bracelet, fuck
It’s kinda like me having a case in the truck
And drinking ‘til I’m blasted harassing and erase a nigga (what)
Keeping 'em open and blacking until I’m leaving ‘em stuck
And got ‘em happier than a child in a park chasing a duck
While I’m chasing a buck these funny
 
niggas be chasing they luck
I be lacing them up like boots when I’m pushing they face in the mud (ahh)
Missiles I fling while I spit live wire
‘Til this shit circling back around
With more fire for me to melt a brick surfacing back a sound
While I light up shit that'll cause a quick
Worship and gather
around, it's
Certain this shit'll splatter cliques painful and make ‘em scatter
Shameful the way I shatter, split shit apart, it doesn't matter (rip)
Your head up off your shoulders (with) bullets bigger than a boulder
And they break ‘em and they know us, classic
And the way it’s going you could easily get your ass kicked
See, me and Shady together we’re crazy
Like baking a vomit and rabies cake like a pastry bitch
(We that sick)
Like I'm from Haiti, I’m suggesting you pay me
Don’t make me wanna spazz (Alalala)
Like I’m a crazy Israeli, bastards
While I bite the beat up and I'm starting to heat up, yack
I’m chopping your foot off, now it’s mine
And I’m putting my feet up, black
Back to the hood and off to the wild
And I’m hoping you protect your child
And I been blacking out so long niggas is asking if the hook had died
Naw, but the beat is fried!
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Apparently there's a light contagiousness to this tirade
It just might make you sick
So irate with this my brain is just like a fucking fried egg
Is my mind scrambled? Cause I'm lit, narrow minded
But go through such a wide range of this emotion
That my rage has gotta squeeze through it sideways
I just pulled up in Clive Davis' driveway
With his personal memoir saying he's bi
Waving a nine, a picket sign, egging his ride
Making him cry "rape"
 
then arrive naked
And drive straight through the gay pride parade, yippee-Ki-Yay
Cause here I - wait, did the world just pee on my leg?
And should I take it as a sign? Maybe to take 'em back into time (Shady)
I stuck out like a sore thumb, so I gave em the finger
To take the attention away from my stinking face it was bringing
Changed the whole complexion of the game
But just in case you was thinking
An inkling of replacing the kingpin
Of crazy, you're wasting your ink then
So if this is any indication of what you may be facing
You better make a distinction cause you fake imitations
Are leaving a bad taste, fuck making a bad impression
That's the worst impersonation I've ever seen and
Who raps nasally, eyes hazelly, rhymes crazily
But sounds like he may need some Flonase when he's speaking?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Hey Mrs. Abraham Lincoln
Other than your husband's fucking brains that were leaking
How'd you think that play was this weekend?
You ain't the real Slim Shady, sit your ass down faggot
See me on a ballot? I'm running for class clown
Rich Democrat, bitch, so I'm just a candidate
To come fuck up the whole party
Me and Flipmode starting a campaign
To have every campus on a fucking rampage
Act my goddamn age? I am eight
So let's get smashed
 
and wake up the next day with the room trashed, covered in Band-Aids
Glass ashtray smashed, champagne splashed on the lampshades
But this ain't up for debate, this is undebatable
Shady for president, ho
Don't make me go take it back to the days of old
Where Sway & Tech radio when I was taking so much NoDoz and LSD
I almost fell asleep on the wake up show
Fuck you telling me, fools?
I was rippin' shop raisin' hell up in Drew's
When Penelope Cruz was still developing boobs
Me and Bus put it down like a sick pet
You're fucking with vets dawg,
 
fucking internet bloggers
"I sit in front of my computer all day and comment on
Everything, I'm an expert on everything, everything sucks, play the next song"
Guess if I hopped out your freaking laptop, you idiot prick
With Biggie and kicked the living shit out you, I'd be dead wrong
Son of God
 
I'm the S.O.G. like a wet log, pores never get clogged
I'm so full of self-esteem that I sweat fog
Yes, yes y’all, steady on the left, y’all
Step off 'forr you get stepped on, soft?
Bout as commercial as my fucking Lear jet
Jealously’ll get you as green as a Chia Pet
I can see that you’re visibly upset, dawg
Alert, alert, girl, alert
Once you enter in my house of pain, you're in a world of hurt, so
Jump around, jump, jump, get that ass shaking
Jump around, jump,
 
came to hit you with a fan favorite
But if you too fly for coach better get them arms and freaking hands flailing
And jump like Van Halen, and pray for a damn tailwind
More afraid of success than I am of failure
So what does that tell ya?
That on a grand scale I don’t give a fuck about nothing
Like Stan mailing his last piece of fan mail
Before he ran straight into the damn railing
[Outro]
Chill, man, chill

     

     
     
     
     
     
     

[Intro]
(I, I wanna grow up too)
"Uncle Marshall, will you tell us a bedtime story?"
Here we go:
[Verse 1]
Now, once upon a time not long ago
There was a little rapper about to blow
But his album came, and it was not good
I think it went lead or double copper-wood
So these silly little fans, they were misled
By a nerdy internet computer hip-hop head
"Me and you, Clef, we're gonna make some cash
Grab this silver paint and just paint my ass"
Hey mister, would you care to bear witness to
The ass-whippin I'm about to administer
To this ass-kissin little vaginal blister?
Stanibus: little Marshall Mathers' sister
And in this corner, we have the "Mr
Not-Havin'-It," it's the Mad, sinister
Dr. Evil, with his bag of tricks for
This little antagonistic faggot
Dick-sucking ex-LL Cool J fan from Windsor
I'm 'bout to murder little Kenny-Fag-Kaniff-sta
You bastard, I ain't wanna have to diss ya
Canibus, where the fuck you at? I miss ya!
[Hook]
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Wherefore art thou, Canibitch?
Please tell me what happened with
That style that you were rappin' with
Canibitch, oh, Canibitch
Are you from Los Angeles
New York, or just a janitor
From Canada?
 
Oh, Canibitch
[Verse 2]
Now, at first, I ain't really understand this shit
Picture me, for a second, and imagine it:
Chillin' in the Bat Mansion relaxin'
When all a sudden some bullshit comes across the scanners, it's
Canibitch, on some 'Stan Lives' shit
It creeped me out at first; man, this is sick
But me, bein' just as sick, this conflict
Gets my dick harder than arithmetic
And I know how you jealous ones envy
I shoulda knew better from the first few letters you sent me
The first two letters, you were tellin' me shit like
You respect me, like any other regular MC
The third letter, you asked how come I ain't return
None of the messages at Shady Records you left me?
The fourth letter: "Slim you're really startin' to upset me"
The fifth letter told me you were comin' to get me
The sixth letter, there's a bomb threat on our building
This crazy motherfucker's really tryin' to kill me
So I went back and read the first few letters that said
Some shit about a message you left
Oh shit! That's not a E, that's an A!
This dude wants to leave me a 'massage,' he's gay!
Right away, 
I'm on the phone with Dr. Dre:
"We got a bogey," "Marshall, I'm on the way"
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
So, in two seconds flat, Dre's at my crib
Only thing is
, 
we both know where this kid lives
And neither one of us have Canadian citizenship
"Shit. Oh Dre, wait a minute, that's it!
All we gotta do is use a bit of turbo-boost
We can fly over the border!" "Let's Go!" [whoosh]
[So we're off to Toronto and we're gainin' speed impact, grunt]
"What was that? Oh, Jermaine Dupri
Fuck it," Keep goin', no time to waste
"Wait, back up. Hit him one more time, in case
"Okay," Fuck, now he's draggin' under the car
Oh well, Only thirty more thousand miles!"
Meanwhile, me and Dre are tryin' to conversate
Just tryin' to find a reason for the constant hate
And tryin' to figure out what happened to 'Germaine Propane'
"He couldn't have fell off that hard."
 
Ain't no way!
What happened to the way you was rappin' when you was scandalous?
That Canibus turned into a television evangelist!
Plus, he raps with his regular voice
 
[four impacts]
"What was that?" "Pet Shop Boys."
So, we pull up to the bridge where he last was spotted
His corpse was still movin', but his ass was rotted
And he kinda smelled a little like Courtney Love
I figured if I stick him with a fork, he's done
So I stabbed him twice. Kept jabbin', Christ!
He won't die!
 
This guy's like a battered wife!
He's like Kim: he keeps comin' back for more
But he won't fight back. I cracked his jaw
Hold up! 'Bis, quit foldin' up!
Punch me in the chest, make my shoulders touch
Do something! At least one punchline!
Come on! Till the meter reads Nine! Nine! Nine-
Ty nine percent of my fans are blond!
'Bis, come on, answer me, man, respond!
Tell me 'bout the sun, rain, moon and stars!
Intergalactical metaphors from Mars!
Raw to the floor, raw like 
!
Bite another line from Redman's song!
Suddenly, the stub of a dead man's arm
From a midget reaches out from under the car
It's J.D.! This motherfucker won't die, neither!
Dre starts sprayin' him with cans of ether
We swamped the bitch in it; stomped the bitch again
"Compton!" "Detroit, bitch, talk some shit again!
Stomp him!" "Switch feet!" "Stomp him!" "Switch again!"
"Dre, all right, he's dead, dog, quit kickin' him!
I think Stanibus jumped off the bridge again!" ("Ahh!")
"Damn," "He disappeared, yo, he's gone, he did it again!"
[Hook]

[Intro]
"
Breaking news, Detroit rapper Eminem cancels his sold-out European tour
To check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction to sleep medication
We'll have more on this story as it develops
"
"Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently
Survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be a random drive-by shooting
Meanwhile, Eminem is rumored to be alienated...
 
on again/off again relationship with..."
"This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's bus..."
"Updating a story we brought you earlier about gunfire at an after-hours
Club we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot."
"Shady/Aftermath recording artist..."
"Long-time best friend of Eminem, and a member of the rap group D12."
"D12 back in the news again today..."
"
Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation
Continue to swirl around Eminem. He insists he's just taking a break
But doubters believe he's retiring
, 
leaving us all to ask
'Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?'"
[Verse 1]
So this is it, this is what I wished for
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment
I just thought the shit'd be different
But something changed the minute that I got a whiff of it
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffing it
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit
I just wanted a little bit
 
then it turned me to a monster
I became a hypocrite, concert after concert
I was raking in the dough, rolling in green
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine
But I was losing my freedom, there was nowhere for me
To not go and be seen, and just go and be me
And there was no in-between, you either loved it or hate it
Every CD critics gave it a 3 then three
Years later they go back and re-rate it
Then called the Slim Shady LP the greatest
The Marshall Mathers was a classic, the Eminem Show was fantastic
But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet
A couple more years that shit'll be Illmatic
And eight years later I'm still at it
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleeping pill addict
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk
My back has been broke and I can still walk
[Hook]
So be careful what you wish for,
 
cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
I said be careful what you wish for, cause you just might get it
And if you get it then you just might not know what to do with it
Cause it might just come back on you ten-fold
[Verse 2]
I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been praying for me
Every day and for some reason it's been weighing on my mind heavy
Cause I don't read every, letter I get
But something told me to go ahead and open it
But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?
You didn't pray for me when I was local
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through
Just to get to
 
where I'm at
, 
I've already told you
At least, a thousand times in these rhymes
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got, God on my side
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?
Just watching it from a opposite standpoint, man boy's got to look
Nuts, and that's the only word I can think of
Right now on how, to describe the shit
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, yo, I'll start it off, yo, 
my name is Shady
, 
his name is Proof
Yo, we used to have a roof upon my house, 
and now we had a mouse that ate the cheese out of the fridge
Didn't want to admit that I was on welfare when I was three
Plus, when I was four, my mother used to leave
She used to always slam the door and say, "Goodbye, 
goodbye
Marshall, I'm leaving, I'm single and right now I'm going to mingle at bingo
Yeah, see you later alligator" is what she said,
 
and I would always stay
At house freezing till I'm dead, cause it was cold inside the house
We never had no heat
, yo Proof used to come walking up the street and be like
"Yo, what up Em? How you doing?", I used to be like
"Yeah, man, it's good to see you dawg!
 But my life's ruined cause my mom
Just left, 
she left my brother Nate
, and I hate the fact we never
Had no food on our plate,"
 so then Proof said
"What up Em?" Yo, so I said, "Proof, won't you come in?"
[Verse 2: Proof]
Yeah, yeah, come in, what’s up with dat?
Tango and cash cash, came to mingle and blast
Together tougher than Alcatraz prison bars
, driving foreign cars
Yes it's me, and my man compadre, 
black and white
White and ivory and black ebony,
 they can't step to me
Rubbery and heavenly, they can't see us in the 
313 vicinity
Ay, yo, Em, ha, ha, ha, ha
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Ha, ha, I come in like ha, ha, I'm ill like, nah nah
And y'all don't wanna see me because I'm ill with the skill
And I can grill and I always keep it real
When I built my garage back after it just got burnt down
Sorry that my parents weren't always around
But it was really hectic growing up
But now I'm blowing up so it don't matter
Every show I do I'm always showing up
To the club drunk as, drunk as fuck, drunk as what?
Can't say that on MTV, but remember it?
Little, old, wimpy me, who used to always dream he'd be on MTV
Now you can't see me, I know you remember that rhyme
Ay, wait a minute, yo check it out, I'm 'bout to flat-line
Pass the mic back to Proof, cause we get loose
We drink 
gin and juice
, sip it cause we always raise the roof
[Verse 4: Proof]
Ay yo, ay yo, we all up in your sights like cataracts
Me and Em tag team, beat any of y'all on some battle rap
See us next time we stripping on your Cadillacs
How you like that? Swing you down like a battleaxe
[Verse 5: Eminem]
I'm down like a battle axe, I got a fatter axe to smash
And I smash your cataracts, cause it's a Cadillac that I be driving
When I be high off fucking vivarin, now you can't see me cause I'm reviving
And surviving in the D, every single day in Detroit
If rappers wanna step to me they better get to the point
Cause they don't understand the way that I do it
The fluid that I be spitting is never written
Cause I'm always, always spitting, cause it
[Verse 6: Proof]
Ay, yo, we make your neck crack like a snare pop
We're fresh and they're not, so give it up
Don't even do this, you're whack
In fact, you get flat-lined, you need practice
We stick you like a cactus, nah, you're not a guy
You're an actress, the fact is
[Verse 7: Eminem]
Here's my address, this is my old address
And called: a street called Dresden
Yo, dead presidents is what I'm resurrecting
Gotta say, "What's up" to Desmond and J.O.B.,
But, yo, they don't don't help me do a thing
They never did, when I was a clever kid rhyming
I always used to go to school and climb in the back baseball diamond
[Verse 8: Proof]
Hold up, hurt shoulder, peace for Kurt Loder
Yeah, we're doing an interview, in a minute or two
We're gonna enter in you
[Verse 9: Eminem]
In the nude when in intrude, don't mean to be rude
But, yo, what's up dude, How you doing MTV?
How you doing Kurt? How you doing everybody else in the world?
You getting hurt by this freestyle that I be coming up with
Erupting and kicking your mother in the tummy and in the stomach
[Verse 10: Proof]
Ay, yo, ay, yo, and all of this we just done is freestyle
Ah, ah, ah, touch don't touch that dial
[Verse 11: Eminem]
Hold it right there, I'm your worse nightmare
Wiping diapers on my high chair, when I was this big
Now I'm still bigger, but I'm skinny like a twig
Skinny little white boy growing up, I liked noise
I spike punch and light joints
[Verse 12: Proof]
Ay, yo, everybody looks for us to follow
We thrust the bottle, thrust the bottle
Bust a bottle over your head
Train your thoughts just like custom model
Your guts is hollow, back up, Proof and Em
[Verse 13: Eminem]
And all them whack MCs step it to me and say
"Nine deuce," just remember that I hate you and yo
I can't stand you, yeah, bye bye!
Goodbye, good night, bye bye, good night
Bye bye, good night, bye, bye

[Verse 1 - Lloyd Banks]
I just touched down - Ferrari-to-concrete
I ain’t even home when they’re talking about me
Fuck out my ear if you talking about "free"
Nigga, free don't pay the bills
I'm ballin all-out, B
These rappers don't know me
Nah, I ain’t your homey
If your name ain't 
Em, Ferrari or Tony
I like my wheel chromey
My Bentley
, 
my Rolly
My Magnum
, my phonie
South Jamaica shawty
These slugs I took in the gut
, 
yo
The work's still here, I'm just cooking it up slow
Clear my mind and whipping the truck low
You’re looking for trouble
I pop death
You’re looking to a sun dawg
If rap ain't work, I be pimpin' on some ho
Still eating lobster and shrimp in the Bungalow
I'm back like crack over the drum roll
You know - wherever I go the gun go
[Hook - Akon]
We on the grind
All the time
Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine
I keep a 
nine
To see the shine
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this paper
Cause I’m a celebrity
Ghetto-celebrity
Ain't nothing changed nigga
[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
The media will test ya, popularity is pressure
Porche Panamera platinum, hammer through the metal
Wreck a booth up, I'm too tough
That inner-city grammar, 
step your jewels up
They bruised up
, I'll sparkle for the camera
Harsh reality's what pulls them
And holding them back from opening
Verbal attack all over these niggas
Push the herd to the back
I'm the kind that they prey on
Spending half of they day on
Lay on niggas for days, the shots spray on
My sound system knock and it pound 2Pac
6 4 jumping like the ground too hot
They spot me, they chase a nigga down two blocks
Two shots in the air for niggas that ain't here
Two tone, two door, grey top, blue floor
Green guap galore
, in and out of new hall
That bright light you saw was a paparazzi flash
I’m tryna snap a picture through your 
Maserati
 glass
[Hook]
[Eminem]
There are enough insults in my head to fill up a swear jar
And have it overflowing
So don't get me going: don't dare start
You'll never see me again: Amelia Earhart
I'm popping a wheelie, off to a really unfair start
I'm past grinding, for me - guess I just be grounded up
Like Ground Round
 
or a pound of chuck
Tightly-wound as fuck
Till the Fire Marshalls come shut
Fire Marshall down and up
I suggest you better shut the fuck up
And stop fucking around and duck!
I ain't playing this time, I told you I'm out for blood
So to say I "keep it 100" would probably sound redundant
Like calling a bitch a ho or asking a gal to suck
And blow on your dick cock.
 
Is she up to screwing? Down to fuck?
It's a man's world and I'm trapped in a land of smut
With a thousand sluts strapped and muzzled
Running through a house of mutts
In other words, I'm shutting every one of you bitches' mouths up
And I'm watching my language if I tell you to kiss my fucking butt!
And ain't shit changed, 
my shit still don't stink
, player
My farts may have gotten staler
 ever since
I became a trailer park celebrity
Maybe my complexion became a little paler
Poster child for white trash
I'm a 
Garbage Pail Kid
 sailor, yeah
See me 
I'm all up on your bitch means I'mma rape her
All I got for these hoes is dick, duct tape and a stapler
So bitch, you better look for table scraps to scrape up
I don't subscribe to the News or the Free Press
But homie, I get the paper!
...fucking stupid

[Proof]
Pah pow
Straight off the coral
Now the Dirtiest street vet from the Mile
Incest without the Texas six-shooter
Body-bullet polluter
Perverted intruder
Now who the fuck wanna buck with the disease
That's diss eased
I got a bitch named trigger
My main squeeze will make your brain freeze
Dirty D. is dope like cane trees
[Eye Kyu]
Remain eased
Maintain chill status with no pause
Hug slugs hit your cabbage
And turn your dome to coleslaw
My only thought of survival before my arrival
I'm jumpin' out on niggas like I'm 5-0
Smack 'em up like a pack o' trifle and fly hoes
Any opportunity to mangle I never pass up
Fuckin' your clique with broomsticks
Face down ass up
Dirty Dozen packin' the shit
To turn your chest red
With that dick in your mouth
Fuckin' everything you just said
[Eminem]
Yeah yeah bitch
Comin' to a block near you is Dirty Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with 30 husbands
When I was five I was already fuckin'
And playin' X-Rated cassettes
With Teddy Ruxpin
I used to walk up and down the block cussin'
Locked in youth homes at 6 for Glock bustin'
I grew up with knot ballers
Who got dollars
Shot callers with guns and rottweilers
[Bizarre]
By any means necessary I'm on a killing spree
It's the devil in me
Intoxicated with wild Hennessy
Beware life ain't fair and I don't care
Cher braids my hair
While her kids are in day care
Two blunts and I'm out for lunch
You're worse than I'm a sugar pie honey bunch
Diss Bizarre Kid, that ain't the answer
You're more uncomfortable than an anorexic cat
With fuckin' cancer
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
[Bizarre]
Locked in the studio boy
I don't wanna mingle
Smokin' LSD workin' on Lou Roff's new single
Who's the big guy that's quick like Sugar Ray
Fuck Calgon bitch
Bizarre might take you away
Give up the pussy cuz I know you a freak
Replacin' your hamster in a week
Cuz my crew's gots to eat
Eight reppin' anorexic girls
Who might eat up cock
(Hold up Bizarre you're takin' that shit too far)
But I can't stop cuz my will ain't there
[Eminem]
Twist 'em up
And dump that bitch in Lake Sinclair
Your mistakes ain't rare
Your rap style annoys
You rhyme like a bitch
Plus I can't stand your voice
Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck
Eat a dick, you need a brick upside your dome
We be the clique runnin' you down in carloads
Leavin' you smashed on tar roads
Flat line like bar codes
[Eye-Kyu]
Put up your guard hoes
I'm blazing heat the way we speak
Not even Nike could cover these amazing feats
Burning rappers eternally
Internally and externally
For half steppin' like one-legged fraternities
Quick draw McGraw
B.K.A. Eye-kyu
Puttin' something inside you
Leavin' holes that I see right through
For anyone obstructing my view
My order of attack
These slugs to your chest
That'll blow your heart out your back
Makin' sure you get fed with a whole lotta led
Then throw you off of the Ambassador Bridge
And scream "DROP DEAD"
[Proof]
Largely I'm out to stack equations
Without a tax evasion
With mossy that's amazin'
All the same like black and asian
My pack evasion attack a stage and
Roll plush like a Cadillac
I wish your fleet would
Try to battle rap
Would make a man bleed
Like a cattle pack stampede
Frontin' cosign my hands bleed
Think they recognize like Sam Sneed
My drug ain't dispose ya
Fold ya couldn't (*BLAM*)
Another classic closure
The death master out to blast ya
My team run shit from the deep East Side
Down to Lasher
Past the - norm
My group swarm
Molest the children of the corn
Dirty D til infinity now bring it on
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants Bitch
Here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance
I shoot the holster off your cowboy pants
You motherfuckers can die
Aiiyo, I shake the world yes yes, yes yes

[Obie Trice - talking]
A lot of motherfuckers man
Lou Green, Shyne Stringer, Keith Stringer
Lawon, Goo Serve, Little Randy
That's what I'm doin this for (EW YEAH!)
Yeah, we ain't here to mourn
We here to celebrate
So this one is for all my dogs that didn't make it in the struggle man
(EW YEAH!)
[Verse 1]
I's remember when I was on the Ave. clutchin them dimes
Gut touchin my spine, bustin my rhymes
Feelin like I'm livin in them lost times
No sight of the future, damn right I shoot ya (ew yeah)
Palm tight on the Rooster
Old in the face, cause this hold on my case
Got my growth at a fast pace
Old folks like "O, oh he's a bad case"
He won't last, his track record'll do the math
Crack solicitation on the Avenue is not new to your listeners
But this is true, listen up
I gotta spew it and keep it all truth or else
I might as well give this up, feel me now
From rocks to pow pows, Glocks to pow-der
I done did it all, so I clutch my balls
And notice they still here, so Obie is still here
So Kobe here's to you and daddy's new career
[Hook] - w/ ad libs
So grab your cups of beer
Put 'em up let's cheer
Here's a toast to all my soldiers who ain't here
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (ew yeah)
Now grab your cups of gin
Put 'em up let's win
Here's a toast to never lookin back again
This is it my niggas this what we boast about
Get your bottles homie, pour some out (ew yeah)
[Verse 2]
Now I understand every man got a story to tell
But fuck it, I got a story as well
Growin up where us niggas either buried or jail
Popped by "Dirty Harry" or popped by the cops for they yayo, locked in a cell
Who's to blame when I was raised in this hood, where my crew was slain
Only a few remains, y'all talk about stuggle
With your bubblegum lifestyle (*scratching*) nigga fuck you
I'm here today for fam passed away
Bodies deep six nigga, flesh decay
Real cats who had techs to spray
Babies to raise, miss them cradles went straight to the grave
The hood life is in me
So I sip the Remy, while my pockets scream "give me"
Lend me your ear, I'm guaranteein y'all feelin me
Straight from the block to the industry (C'MON)
[Hook]
[Obie Trice - talking]
Yeah, all my homies that's deceased rest in peace
My nigga KF Ski, Little Green
P-Funk you'll be home in a minute nigga, haha, we get it poppin
We got a chance to speak to the world nigga, haha, and I ain't stoppin
Straight off the craft .. 313
(EW YEAH!)

[Intro]
You are now listening to the sounds
 
of Shady
And Alchemist, Alchemist, Alchemist
[Verse]
Got an axe in the duffel bag
, 
couple of fags
Stuffed in the backseat, 
muzzled and gagged
Wrapped in bubble wrap, two lesbians, a 
couple hustler mags
Now grab the Pez dispenser, fill it up to the max
With muscle relaxers,
 
the governor of Alaska
She lusts when I ask her
 
to shove my Polaski sausage up in her ass, huh
While we hover over Nebraska shootin' at the fuckin' buffalo pasture
In the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screamin' "Grab my titties, Shady suck on those bastards"
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a gigalo, bitch I look like the juggalo rapper?
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper
Shit, back down, man I'd rather lick on a scrotum
And eat the fuckin'
 
octo Mom's
 
pussy lips
 
with some okra
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissor with Oprah
While Rosey
 
pussy farts
 and takes a piss on the sofa
Get a boner 
and play dick swords with the Jonas
Brothers,
 
your motherfuckin' mothers are roamers
Like no other,
 
I keep thinkin' of her smothered in soma's
[Hook]
Its chemical warfare, drop bombs like Sadam
I'm bringing the drama, like Barrack Obama
Playing rock em' sock em' robots with the
 
Octo Mama
I'm vato loco,
 
homie I'll cock those
 
llamas
For chemical warfare
(Fuck did I just talk about the octomom twice in the same rap? Fucking whack)

[Eminem]
Here we go again
[50 Cent]
Does it make you mad when I switch my flow
You can't understand how I get my dough
50 Cent, I'm on fire cause Shady said so
I'm on Fire
[Eminem]
Everybody's in a rush try to get the throne
I just get on the track and try to set the tone
I ain't trying to use nobody as a steppin' stone
But don't compare me, I'm better off just left alone
And I ain't even trying to go there with record sales
I'm just trying to keep it humble and respect myself
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D12
Keep my nose clean, stay away from weapons, jail
And living reckless
But if you go check my belt
You may see something else I used to protect myself
A vest, to stop a Rueger and deflect the shells
And send 'em back at you faster than they left the barrel
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to
Got undercover cops that'll legally pop you
And I done seen a lot of people cross the line
But this motherfucker Ja must have lost his mind
That X,
 
got him thinkin' he was DMX
Then he switched to 'Pac now he's tryna be him next
So which one are you? X, Luther, Pac or Michael
Just keep singin' the same song, recycled
We'd all much rather get along than fight you
Me and Hailie danced to your songs, we liked you
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth
C'mon now, you know the white boy'll bite you
I hurt your pride dawg and you know I don't like to
But I will if I have to, with syllable after syllable I just slap you
Killin' you fasta than you poppin' pill after little pill of them tabs of that shit you on
But if you want it you got it you'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it
But if we lock horns we can charge harder than Busta
We bump heads wit any motherfucker that wants to
So whats the, deal where was all the tough talk?
When I walked up to you like, Ja what up dawg?
How come you didn't say you had a problem then?
When you was standin' there wit all your men, we coulda solved this then
I'mma grown man dawg come holla
All you did was slap hands, smile and swallow
Another one of them little X pills in front of me
And tell me 50 Cent was everything you wanna be
 come on
[Refrain: 50 Cent]
I know you don't want it with me, you know you don't want it with me
You, talk an' you soon will see, you don't wanna bump heads with me
I know you don't want it with me, tou, talk an' you soon you will see
You know you don't want it with me
[Tony Yayo]
You couldn't son me if my father helped you
My punchlines is hot, my bars will melt you
Ja you Stuart Little, shells'll lift you
Every other week 
I'm buyin' a new pistol
I clap at your ass with this chrome 38
And put six thru your h
at a seven and 3/8's
Irv you ain't Suge Knight, you should shook night
I put my knife in ya wind pipe and breeze through the turnpike
You know and I know who took ya chain
You got robbed two times so ya ass is lame
I'm down to die for this shit all I need is bail
You better stick to the movies with Steven Seigal, bitch
[Refrain]
[Lloyd Banks]
Fuck that, I'm miles away
And these industry niggas startin' to get outta hand
Like I won't find your whereabouts by stompin' 'em out ya man
We killin' New York, even in Compton they understand
I'm on the block where you was raised doin' chocolate out the van and
They see me pop a boy for icey cause I could
But you been gone so long you probably forgot your way around the hood
Cause when you paranoid it's hard to make a song
How you want it wit' us, half of your artists got make-up on
Every magazine I own your on your knees takin' prayer pictures
And you ain't even got shot yet, you scared bitches
You don't know nothin' about what pain is sucka
I'll put your ass underground like a train conductor, muh'fucker

[Intro]
You know, technically, I'm not even really supposed to be here right now.
 
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it...
 
Feels good.
 
Guess I'm lucky.
 
Some of us don't get a second chance.
 
But I ain't blowing this one. Nah, man. Shit, I feel like I can do anything now
[Bridge]
Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water?
Coming out the nozzle on the fire hose,
 
flyer than swatters
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Smash an hourglass, grab the sand, take his hands and cup 'em
Spit a rhyme and freeze the clock, take the hands of time and cuff 'em
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man
Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
[Verse 1]
There's a storm coming that the weatherman couldn't predict
I start the bug, prick
 
you better, flee cause I get ticked
It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down, I was kicked, I got up
I'm back to punch you to the ground,
 
you trick, it's a trap
Fuck my last CD, the shit's in my trash
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last
You can die in the blink of an eye
So bat your eyelashes, and keep winking and blowing kisses
Cause you're flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood, I ain't just hurting your rep
I catch a flow and get going, no remorse I'm showing
Ain't slowing for no one
Knowing there is nothing you can do about it
Zero in on the target like a marksman, the target is you
I shut your lane down,
 
took your spot, parked in it too
Arsenic flow, lighter fluid saliva: what can you do?
Go get your crew to hype you up stand behind you like "whoooo!"
That boy's hot enough to melt Hell, burn Satan too
Fry his ass and put his ashes back together with glue
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too
This game could ill afford to lose him, how 'bout you?
 
Now guess who?
[Hook]
Here's a clue
He came to a ball in a wife beater lost his Nike shoe
It's in your ass,
 
he's in your ass, he's all up in your psyche too
Now what's his name? Cinderella man, Cinderella man
If I had a time machine, I'd be Cinderella man
Music is my time machine so call me (Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
[Bridge]
Fuck catching lightning, he struck it, screamed "Shut up" at thunder
Flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
Rewound the future to the present, paused it – don't ask how
Fuck the past, mothafucka, he's the shit right now
(Cinderella man, Cinderella man)
[Verse 2]
Cinderella man, Cinder Fellow, Shady dane
Came to wrap the game up in cellophane,
 
raise hell, from Hell he came
But didn't come to bore you with the Cinderella story
Nor did he come to do the same,
 
can't afford to be a lame-o
In this day and age and at this stage of the game
Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly
So say "bye" to the old, "H-I" to the new
 
que sera
Consider it his last hurrah,
 
the coup de grâce
Raise 'em high in the sky, keep 'em up, time to bring the place alive
Thanks for being patient, I will make no more mistakes
Shit, my potato's baked, homie, the veggies on my plate can fly
My filet is smoking weed, yeah, faggot, the steaks are high
Shit I ain't even suppose to be here
By the grace of god, the skin on my teeth
And the hair on my nuts, I skated by
Now y'all are on thin ice with ankle weights
 
I hate to lie
How fucking irritated are you? How much in your face am I?
It ain't shit you could do but fear it
Proof is here in spirit
, 
I'm the spitting image
I'll mirror it when I stand near it, 
your pussy lyric: I "cunt" hear it
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists, who?
[Hook]

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah! Come on! Come on!
ATL! Yeah! Haha! WOO!
If you feel like you've been touched
By our music that is
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Nowadays everybody just wanna poke their nose in our business
What is this some kinda joke?
Man, everywhere I go all I’m hearing is more talk
"What’s up with Jada and Fat Joe?
Doing a song with ol’ boy on a song “New York”
Man, I thought you just did a song with them both?”
Man, the streets wanna know how you gonna go and diss Michael
You should get your ghetto pass revoked
I never had no ghetto pass,
 
you asshole
You really wanna know, when I did live in the ghetto
I kept a trespassing charge up at the railroad tracks
So I suggest you get your facts straight before you go
This assuming to know
I ain't grow up in no trailer park just cause I was poor
Man, this is my testimo...ny to those that don’t know
Me, and feel like they do
If not to feel compelled to go and speak on me too
So this dick goes to YOU and this dick goes to YOU
And if you feel like you want it then you can get it too
And when your through pass it to the person next to you
Ayo, Stat get on the mic and come and spit a few
[Verse 2: Stat Quo]
Motherfucker's so quick, to spit bullshit
Stat Quo, who’s this, Em gave me the assist
Shorty got a full clip, standing in the pulpit
A–Town misfit, repping that south shit
Back four or some years ago, foe was hating, I hear them
My flow is skating across the track, rollerblading
Losing patience, want to get on chasing but this taking all my energy
Tired of waiting, people faking fronting like they kin to me
When they're really enemies, give a fuck what it is
Cuz, this what it gonna be, Shady/Aftermath lately
GMM, baby, young nigga out them projects Thomasville
Grady hospital, Freida’s only baby
Niggas biting my style get rabies
Fuck you, pay me, eat a cock, swallow shit
And plus you ain't fucking with this, so don’t trip, ha ha
???, what an incredible twist
I write incredible script
That fit in with the plot it’s endless
Now testify to this
Let it bang when you hear, this is classic shit

[Intro]
Where's my snare, I have no snare in my headphones
There you go
[Verse 1]
Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?
I have
; 
I've been protested and demonstrated against
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes
, 
look at the times
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin' kid that's behind
All this commotion
 
emotions run deep as oceans
 
explodin'
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin'
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give 'em hell long as I'm breathin'
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now
[Hook: Eminem]
I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
 
(one more time)
I said I'm sorry momma
I never meant to hurt you
I never meant to make you cry; but tonight
I'm cleanin' out my closet
[Verse 2]
Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet
And I don't know if no one knows it
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it
I'mma expose it
; 
I'll take you back to '73
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch
Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try
To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake
I maybe made some mistakes
But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun
Cause I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and them both
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition
Take a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision
Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen
Bitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'
Goin' through public housing systems,
 
victim of Münchausen’s Syndrome
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't
'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach
Doesn't it?
 
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?
But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when you're lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony
And Hailie's gettin' so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful
But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong
Bitch do your song - keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get
You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me
Well guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be!
[Hook]

Or your brother's the one that you're running from?

B-I-G
Who fucking with me?
Oh God!
[Hook: Big Sean]
Ain't nobody fucking with my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
Ain't nobody fresher than my muthafuckin
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
As I look around, they don't do it like my
Clique, clique, clique, clique, clique
And all these bad bitches, man, they want the
They want the, they want the
[Verse One: The Notorious B.I.G]
I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese
When I release, you lose teeth like Lil' Cease
Nigga please, blood floods your dungarees
And that's just the half of my warpath
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater
Than the average playa hater, and spectators
Buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low though"
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes
Short-change niggas, snort 'caine niggas
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be
Til Lil' Cease crippled me
Now I play hard, like my girl's nipples be
The game sour like a pickle be, y'all know da rules
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin 'bout
All the planes we flew, bitches, we ran through
Now the year's new, I lay my game flat
I want my spot back, take two
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggas envious
Too many niggas on my dick, shit strenuous
When my men bust, you just move with such stamina
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha (we ain't mad at cha)
Blood rushin', concussions, ain't nothin
Catch cases, come out fronting, smokin somethin
Sippin' White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin'
I laced it with the basic, six TVs a system
Knockin' Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up
Wipe the pee up, lick shots, woke your seed up
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up
Long kiss
[Hook]
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
I'll probably be punished for hard living, blind to the facts:
Thugs is convicts in God's prison, hands on the strap
Praying so Father please forgive me! Police be rushing when they see me
I flaunt it: America's Most Wanted, live on T.V
Life: pleasure and pain, stuck in this game, holler my name!
We all gon' die, we bleed through similar veins
Please explain to me, now. Don't panic when my guns burst
Heard the last jam, nigga? This one's worse!
My nigga Bone held the chrome 'til I came home
Thug Luv players tell these bitch niggas "bring it on"
I caught a plane out to Cleveland late last evening
To help my niggas clean up some niggas no longer breathin'
Now, who do you believe in? Hit the weed and breathe
It's a cold-ass world; niggas kill you in your sleep
Watch me until they stop me, bury, murder me or drop me
I got Thug Luv for my nationwide posse. Feel me!
[Hook:]
[Interlude: 50 Cent]
Haha...Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
[Verse Three: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em 50
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this doc
Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
You now about to witness the power of...
[Interlude: Kanye West]
Of my clique...
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Skylar Grey]
If you got a sweet tooth, you can taste my watermelons
If the swingset bores you, I can show you all my talents
I can wear a tan, like other bitches can't
You can have all this, boy
And there's only one thing that I want from you
[Hook: Skylar Grey]
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle
We can get a little more physical
Baby, after all, it's only natural
I feel it comin', comin', comin'
Ohh
I feel it runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ohh
Come on, let me ride your bicycle
It's so fantastical, on your bicycle
[Hook 2: Eminem]
You want to ride my bicycle
You want to ride my bike
Haha
[Verse 2: Skylar Grey]
If the world starts freezing, I can make it hot and humid
If you get a bee sting, I can suck out all the poison
I can make you last, like other bitches can't
Have I made it clear, boy?
There's only one thing that I want from you
[Hook]
[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
I'm only fucking with you
Fuck you for thinking it's true
I'm not like the sluts in this town
They make me blehh in my mouth
I wanna ride on your bike
Cause you're the boy that I like
It's like I'm a sell out for you
But your bike's so shiny and new
[Verse 3: Eminem]
She's distracted
By my reflectors, man, I can tell the chick's attracted
My wheels spoke to her
, 
my Schwinn is a chick magnet
Bagging up chicks like a bag of chips
With a bag of prophylactics
 
as big as Mick Jagger lips
Shagging is something I'm a pro at, but I ain't practicing shit
Allen Iverson of safe sex, condoms are for practice, man, I skip practice
Flip backwards while I flip this bike on its banana seat
My fantasy is to have you land where the kickstand is
Got this bitch gagging, they call me the broad killer
I'm the cousin of Godzilla, cause I spit fire and my dick is draggin'
Zig zaggin' up the avenue,
 
pulling these chicks in my antagonist wagon
Screamin'
[Hook]
[Hook 2]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
It starts off something like, "Shady's an insane maniac
Yeah, Slim Shady, that's a zany name, ain't it?"
Now all you need's an image to go with the name, baby
Wifebeaters and white t-shirts
, 
Hanes mainly
It's a long shot, but is it possible? There's a lane, maybe
If not he's gon' have to come and change the whole game, ain't he?
He wants the fame so bad he can taste it, he can see his name up in lights
Women screaming his fucking name, fainting
Shady did it, he sold out the whole dang stadium
Joe Shmoe
 
made it
, 
he took his Plain Jane lady
And his baby Hailie out the trailer
 
but he ain't trailing anymore
He's ahead of the race, while maintaining his innocence
Little does he know his train is derailing
And he's about to be raped by this game anally, now
[Hook: Jazmine Sullivan]
What would you do for a little bit?
What would you give for a little bit of that C-O-C-A-I-N-E?
I got to have it, yeah I made it, I'm addicted, 
yeah I'm fading
(Cause once you cave in, you don't want to leave)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
You’re operating on all cylinders
, 
syllables spit like dillingers
Spilling your guts
, 
people are feeling your mic skills
But these haters are 
ice grilling
 ya
Willing to sacrifice anything for the life that they might steal from ya
Fake friends will kill for ya, die for ya
 
but you can’t decipher
Why for the life of ya,
 
it wasn’t like this when you were cyphering
Argue with your wife again
, she found 
Vicodin
In your pants last night again, 
your dispute's public
Nothing is private anymore,
 
oh, and your best friend?
Say bye-bye to him,
 
what kind of apple you take a bite of Slim?
(But this is what you wanted Marshall, ain't it?)
 
Fuck no!
The way that it turned out
 
was nothin' like the picture that I painted
In my head,
 
sometimes a dream and making it's more fun
Than it's to actually make it,
 
the game stripped me naked
It robbed me of ever having another real relationship
With another girl, this world is a
 
fucking trip
As I slip in another world, proceed, take another hit
Sniff 'til I fucking hurl,
 
tell 'em all to fucking sit
And spin 'til they fucking twirl,
 
middle finger up
 again
Relapsing back in this game
, oh well, fuck it then, now
[Hook]
[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
You start off bright, just to see your name in lights
Just so you can live the life
You take a bite and lose your sight, they call this (fame)
You think you're good, just cause you got out the hood
Concerned only with getting dough, no longer poor
But you lost your soul, they call it (fame)
I hear it callin', my name is callin'
Why you struggling when you could be ballin'?
My head is saying yes but my feet is stallin'
So many walkin' by the end they fallin'
But I gots to have it, like 
Eve and the apple
She had to grab it, I got to take it, I got to make it
That's the plan and I can't forsake it, yeah
[Hook]

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Slaughterhouse!
 
Bus-a-Bus!
Somebody better hurry up and find the nearest fucking exit!
Joe Budden, come on!
[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
Barge our way through, they wouldn't open the door
First time high, they couldn't know it was raw
You would die if you smoked it, too potent to snort
If you think by the bar, you probably choke on the thought
What up, what up, what up? Speed dial a coroner
Done with subliminals, now I'm talking to all of ya
Try my patience, wearing it thin
I put my prints in your heart without piercing the skin
What up, what up, what up? I only need knuckles
Tell him to travel safe, then make his knees buckle
Before they love you, they gotta hate you
They say that real recognize real dog, you can spot fake too
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Y'all know what it is, cause we do it often
Caught another body, buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin
We burn shit down, blow torch scorching
Slaughterhouse bitch, buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin
What up, what up, what up? Buy another coffin
[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Knick-knack, paddy whack, Yaowa wanna bone
Click-clack, acrobatic coward with the chrome
Purchase another casket, I'm murdering ya bastards
My Desert Eagle's a bird, dirty little rachet
Lose a part of ya when the hollow one touch ya
Screaming "Oh ahh," when I Bus-a-Bus ya
I dress my baby up, she got a custom muffler
She be like "pew-pew" you be like "uh, uh, uh"
Can you lean with it? Can you drop with it?
Next time I tell you shoo, put a sock in it
What up, what up, what up? Act calm chief
We Sasquatch beef, big foot up your butt, shut up
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Crooked I]
The most beautifulest thing in this world
Are the funerals I bring to this world
What up, what up, what up? Give me the beat, I'mma body it
John Gotti it,
 Crooked probably bodied the audience
What up, what up, what up? Then I'm tryna find a whore
Dig in that vagina like I'm mining for diamonds or
I'm tryna find China or some kind of dinosaur
Try to score like Kentucky in the final four
Yeah, you niggas still wussies
My gun is my other dick, cause it kill pussies
I'm hood, you good? I'm just checking homie
Still hammer dancing, two stepping with my weapon on...me
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
I said if I ain't fucking with you, you can suck a short for Richard
Until you hiccup, hiccup, need I say...more?
Listening to a free beat by Dre in some free Beats by Dre...or
Tell my attorney to cook it and eat it,
 
I play catch with the body
Of Bernie from Weekend at Bernie's with Crooked this evening
I'm up in y'all spot with Jersey Joe Walcott
And Brooklyn Ortiz, just please give us a reason
What up, what up, what up? Fuck all the singing
I'm about to be a rich nigga and waste the whole last bar screaming
You ready? AAAAHHHH
[Hook]
[Outro: Royce da 5'9"]
Yeah, what's up world?
Ha-ha, we here
You ready? AAAAHHHH

(Verse 1: Eminem)
Your style is generic, mine's authentic made
I roll like a 
renegade
, you need clinic aid
My techniques bizzare and ill
, 
I scar and kill
You were a star until I served you like a bar and grill
Now I proceed to cook and grill ya, that's all it took to kill ya
You better recognize me like I look familiar
You wanna battle?
You beat around the bush like you scared to lick pussy, so you eat around the tush
I need a clown to push, someone that I can bully
Wait a minute - I don't think you understand fully
See, me without a style is like mustard without the Heinz
I lead the new school, you're a Busta without the Rhymes
I'll crush the shit out your lines
[
Verse 1: Omar Benson Miller)
Now I'm the Rashiki 
smoking the lick licky
Ten freaky girls inside 
The Chin Tiki
Girl, when you see me you better believe me
This ain't a game and 
pimping ain't easy
Anything goes when it comes to hoes
I'm the kingpin when it comes to flows
You better ask someone if you don't know
When you see me girl, say what's up dogg
Ten freaky girls, ten, ten, ten freaky girls

[Intro]
Cause some things just, don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world, knows your name
So on a, bigger stage
They came to see you spit your game
So it shouldn't be difficult, to explain
Just why you came back again
You hate the fame, love the game
Cold as ice, you remain
Fuck them all, tell them all eat shit, here we go again
[Spoken]
Goddamn
Is it that time again already?
Haha, you don’t look too happy to see me
Fuck man, don’t everybody welcome me back at once
All right, just fuck ya’ll then
[Verse 1]
You can get the dick, just call me the ball sack, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, dog, fall back you mutts
Fuck your worms, you've never seen such a sick puppy
Fuck it a sick duck,
 
I want my duck sicked
 
mommy
And my nuts licked, gobble them up trick, yummy
Bitch you don't fuckin' think I know that you suck dick, dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey
Yeah, I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny
Shorty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve, sucker
Motherfucka', might as well let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cocksucker
The shit is on cause you went and pissed me off, now I'm shittin' and pissin' on everybody give a fuck if it's right or wrong
So puff the buddha light a bong
But take a look at Mariah, next time I inspire you to write a song,
 come on
[Hook]
I'm as cold as the cold wind, blows when it snows and it's 20 below
Ask me why man, I just don't know I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
[Verse 2]
Fuck it I'm a loose cannon,
 
Bruce Banner's back in the booth,
       
y'all are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standin'
I'll set the world on fire, piss on it put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fuckin' around
Mothafucka
 
I'll show you pussyfootin'
I'll kick a bitch in the cunt, 'til it makes a queef and sounds like a fuckin' whoopee cushion
Who the fuck is you pushing?
 
You musta mistook me for some
Sissy soft punk lookin' for some nookie or bosom
Go ahead fuckin' hater, push me
I'll told you ain't no fucking way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the fuck up, sissy, G's up all you gardeners freeze up
Put your hoes down
 
“Shady ease up
Man chill” Naw, I can't goddamn it
 
rap is a landfill
Drop the anvil, these are shoes that you can't fill
Shit the day that happens the world will stop spinnin' and Michael J. Fox'll come to a standstill
During a earthquake
, 
urine in your face
 cause you're fake
"Ah! What the fuck? That hurt! Wait
Ah what the fuck! I just got struck
By lightning"
all right then I quit, God, I give up
Call it "Evil That Men Do"
Lord forgive me for what my pen do
“This is for your sins, I cleanse you, you can repent
But I warn you, if you continue to hell I send you”
And just then the wind blew and I said
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
How long will I be this way?
Shady until my dying day,
 
'til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long
 
'til then I'll drop the fuckin' bombs
Like I missed the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong,
 
now sing along
Slut this slut that,
 
learn the words to the song!
"Oh, bitches don't like that"
 
Homie, I'll be nicer to women
When Aquaman drowns and the Human Torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo
 
So don't compare
Me to the other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges
, 
peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy,
 
cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear you try to diss me I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with Auto-tune
The last thing you want to do
Is have me spit out a rhyme, and say "I was writing this and I thought of you", so
[Hook]
[Outro]
I don't know, I don't know, what caused
I don't know what caused me to be this way
I don't know, I don't know but I'll, probably be this way 'til my dying day
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold, mean things I don't mean to say
I guess this is how you made me

Good mornin'!
Haha, wake your mother fuckin' asses up!
Yo what is the what?
Well come on then, you know what time it is!
Stop sleepin' on my roof bitch!
[Verse 1: Eminem]
For whatever it's worth it's worth me havin my ass whipped
Cause I'mma have the last lift that ever gets ass squished
I just can't get past these little pissants
That wanna be rauny bad asses so bad
And they so mad they can't stand it
Cause we can and they can't spit (Haawk)
And they can't handle it like a man
And that's when it just happens
And I snap and it's a wrap
, 
and it's a scrap an then it isn't rap is it?
Hip-Hop isn't a sport anymore when you got to go and resort back into that shit
Maybe I'm old fashioned but my passion
Is to smash anyone rappin without havin a slappin
Believe me I'd much rather pick up a pencil than a pistol but I'm pissed now
But it all depends on just how far it get's took on the mic
Cause I'm tellin you right now your not gonna like it
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me
You poke a stick at a pit bull you get bit B
These words stick to you like crazy glue
When you diss me cause they just bounce off me like bullets through fifty!
I'm the beatiful-est thing and your gonna miss me when I'm gone
Like Kieth Murray when he threw a stool and hit a girl acci-dently (argghhh!!)
I do this for Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy & Proof are you with me?
[Hook: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn and
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin'
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin'
So up an sing along with the words to the song and
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in
[Verse 2: Swifty]
They consider me the epitome of a beef starter
In a party with heat it's hard to keep me without one
Fuck snubs I walk in clubs with a shotgun
Constantly popin slugs they hot son, better not run
The bosses of all bosses a haluocaust to whoever ain't concious
In a house full of dog shit
I'mma gothic death project, you stop breathin
You die quicker than mach speed without bleedin
It ain't about what you readin
When you meet me better speak like a season's greetins
Either that or we'll be beefin free when
You niggas need a 'E' just to speak shit!
Your leader is a botique bitch
Keep the heater where you can reach quick
I snipe you with it and we won't even keep it a secret
Nigga I did it from a mind of a mental patient
When Glocks wave you can save that conversation for satan
You brave?
[Hook: Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn and
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin'
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin'
So up an sing along with the words to the song and
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in
[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
Yo yo I heard you niggas don't like us
But so what this beef is like
'What tha fuck did he say in his rap Em?'
I can see that he's just a punk
I mean these niggas squeeze on me
Please I'm seeing guts
I don't need no enemies, as my family a couple trucks
Am I empty seein them ?? I emtpy out them ?? to fight you
In front of every reporter that I don't like
No need for metaphors I get points across when I write
So emotions enough to say "fuck you bitch, and I don't like you, WHAT!"
I might as well give this up like heavy sales
And just fuck an leave D12 and this blunt
We can't self destruct
I've never felt it this much
Come on fellas, get up
We got to fight like Bugz last night of his life
[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I walk with a limp, pistol hangin off'a tha hip
I'm awkward and quick enough an sick when sparkin a fith
Your carcus is split even the beef is partially thick
We can't take you serious, you a comedy skit
You probaly wish that you could be out shootin them G's
But the only thing you shoot is the breeze
I can't believe you speaking on movin key's
But every time we hear you kick it
The only thing you sellin is wolf tickets
I look wicked cause niggas will test your nut sack
So when they bust you better bust back
And get your guts clapped outa your stomach
And when they want it (yeah)
I bring a hundred niggas from Runyan
So get to gunnin and if you comin
[Hook:Eminem]
Come on an everybody come on in
Kick your shoes off mother fuckers come on in
Cause we get it on an till the brick of dawn and
Wake your ass up mother fuckers quit yawnin'
Cause we ain't leavin till 6 in tha mornin'
So up an sing along with the words to the song and
If you don't know the words an you can't sing along an
Fake like you know em mother fuckers an join in
Everybody come on in

I wasn't born mean I was pushed to treachery
I walked the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I like a veggie brain, turn to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the MC
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg, made outta wood? I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dike on the mic, I'm kinda like
Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes
Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash, bumping Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn near﻿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash, hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge, into on coming traffic
Caused a massive 42 car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard, you can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdraw
Dick's so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man, with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic Sport

We Back (Invasion) Part II
The Conspiracy
[Eminem]
Cause we ain't gonna never stop, you just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find something to do with your time
 (time)
And quit fuckin' with us cause we ain't fuckin' with you
And E must be fuckin' with you so much you must be gone out your mind
They say I'm a day away from my entire empire crumbling
Speak up you're mumbling, 
what the fuck-a you's a
Bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby
This is Shady I know you was bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would just go away
But weeble mable 
weeble wobble but we don't fall down
 like
Jam Master Jay
's two turntables, our label is just too stable
Your magazine's so motherfucking thin you using staples
To hold it together it's turning back into a newspaper
And ya'll got somethin' for my ass every issue
Thank you, cause I keep runnin' out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but God I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when Nike's got a new tennis shoe
But-but I guess no good news is always good good news
Moving on to bigger and better things (chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up
, 
this year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on?
 
Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady, wait a minute, baby, leave the whore alone
Just go up there and be humble and take them awards home
Bush has just declared the world a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war going on of our own at home
My fuckin' mind's blown
, trying to figure out how to fight 
my own clone
Rhinestones are so nice, they shine so bright especially at night
After a hit of ecstasy, ain't that right Ro'oh?
Wait a minute I'm rambling
, back to the matter at hand
It's Green Lantern with Elvis Presley the selfish MC
Back to the ruin rap and destroy the industry
Single handedly and oh man did we, 
yeah me and 50
Obie, me and Twizzy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
 god damn it's all a plan devised by the man
It's a conspiracy...against fake shit, and anybody who can't make hits
Or ain't dope lyrically, 
so fuck what you heard and what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby we're just trying to weed it out
Shady in the place to be see, and I got what it takes to rock the mic, aiight!
Still keep talking shit to me punk
Cause your magazine's over in less than 6 months!
Haha...Shady Records, still Aftermath!
And don't think we can hear you motherfuckers talking, cause we can't
We don't hear y'all
So we just gonna sit back for the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks

Hard headed and hot headed, bull headed and pig headed
Dick headed, a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick witted, for every lyric spitted there are 6 critics
Who wait for me to slip with it, so quick
This dynamite stick buried the wick, it's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it and it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling, when I stop selling I quit
So stop dwelling an I am not felling
You fuckers are not ready, cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is Destiny, yes money I'm of running
So get off of me, I'm not slowing or softening
[Hook - 2Pac]
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed
My firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed
And fuck the world til I'm gone, Constantly armed
They sendin armies out to bomb me, Constantly armed
The only DJ that can calm me is Constantly armed
My firepower keep me warm I'm Constantly armed
And fuck the world til I'm gone Bitches be warned
[Eminem 2x]
I will not fall
I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me
[2Pac]
Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin to kill me
Picturin pistols, spittin hollow points til they drill me
Keepin it real, and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts, preoccupied with keepin steel
See niggas is false, sittin in court, turned snitches
That used to be real, but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin to be strong
, 
my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm, and fuck the world til I'm gone, Bitches be warned
Word is bonb, you'll get torn
I'm bustin on Guiliani, he rubbin my niggas wrong
And then it's on, before I leave picture me
I'm spittin at punk bitches and hustlin to be free
Watch me set it, niggas don't want it, you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga, we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me, have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do', with fo

“Stronger Than I Was”[Intro: Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds
With a record of 17 rapes, 400 assaults and 4 murders
The undisputed, most diabolical villain in the world, Slim Shady
[Hook: Eminem]
So crack a bottle
, 
let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model, you just hit the lotto
O-oh, o-oh, 
bitches hopping in my
 
Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun
 and 
no not one of them got clothes
Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and 
my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Ok, let's go
Back with Andre
 
the giant
, 
mister elephant tusk
Fix your musk, you'll be just 
another one bit the dust
Just one of my mother's sons who got thrown under the bus
Kiss my butt, lick fromunda cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I lay in the cutt
Fisticuffs
, the lady give her eighty some paper cut
Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cause when I spit the verse the 
shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary
, 
the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with 
the center of attention
 it's true
Not to mention back with a vengeance so here's the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio's back on you hoes
[Hook]
[Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cause I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say, I love LA
Cause over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end, let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino, or the El Dorado
The hell if I know, do I want leather seats or vinyl
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maaco
 
beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though
[Hook]
[Eminem]
And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
It's what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm
, 
the bomb
, 
the don
I'm King Kong,
 
get rolled, on wrapped up
 
and reigned on
I'm so calm
, through 
Vietnam
, 
ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marijuana, do what you want
Nigga on and on, till the break of what
Get the 
paper
 man, I'm 
caking
, you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like it's supposed to be blown,
 
motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt, I style, I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want so what I trick
Fat ass Birkin bags, some classy shit
Jimmy Choo
 shoes, 
I say move a bitch move
[Hook]

[Intro]
"[?] man!"
I stand in by the way as I begin
Do you know who I am?
 and may reply with a grin
Yes, I'm tired of being ignored
Why should I be secluded? I got a brand new horn to be tooted
To sum it up in a nutshell, "Eminem will you kick it for me?"
So I find myself in a certain obligatory
A place where I dwell in, for some wonderful productions
To make up for lost time, ???? obstruction
Finally let loose, unloading the stockpile
A mental projectile, I aim like a reptile
I look to the one handed juggler and ask him this
"Why is it you insist upon stepping to an octopus?"
Is there a reason for this? The hatred is aggravating
How many times will it take you before you realize you're fading?
Fading from existence, cause simulations are dead
There's so much more to learn, it pages left to be read
So put up the front while you jam for the grammar that's poor
While I hold the scrapbook that's heavier
Than the hammer of the mighty Thor
Words can weigh a ton
Therefore it's never to fall
Into the hands of the wrong one
[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another
There are few have made an attempt to put a foot on the other side
But I see no borderline
, 
from under this colorblind
And some will probably never hold peices of the sacred
But then I'm finally about to put an end to the hatred
The world would never endure to arguing
Awaking to the abscence of unity is startling
"Oh foolish pride, what the hell is you trying to do?
You cannot beat someone that's better than you so quit trying to"
The outcome we want that mean nothing are despicable
So how do you think you can manage to kick the unkickable
You're graceless, bland, you're tasteless and you're
 
faceless
 and
You're dull it's time you faced this, here taste this
Straight from off of the pile, one of the numerous styles
The date of my birth on the Earth, the deliverance of a starchild
Rest with formidable talent and versatility
But with such a power, there comes a responsibilty
To infringe on the boundaries, so now the defiance is clear
To form an alliance is something even the giants fear
So instead of being oblivious to the color of skin
Refuser abusing it's accepted now it's a trend
[Scratched samples] - "Yeah", "It's another..."
[Eminem]
You know I don't understand why we all just can't get along
You hate me but you know me and what I stand for
No?
 
so then why do you speak for me
And every other white man when you that we're your enemy?
On the floor lies a broken door, cause 
I'm not to be spoken for
Stereotypes and superstitions and fictional folklore
Rarely do you see the lighter side of me
I try to be persuasive but also invasive and try to end the rivalry
But I've ???? apologies are exhausted
Feelings are turning glacial never to be defrosted
So who can I trust after repeatedly being shafted
Switch to the opposite, now see it being re-enacted
Pull up the ????????????? quick
These ????? we hate him, these ??? are past us, huh
Always fighting for the position of top dog
That spot's already occupied, and I don't play leapfrog
Cause I do not wish to fight over territory that's already mine
But I'm always having to prove myself, time after time
Oh how I never understand how a man could be outcast
Judged from the past and he's put last
And ??bluffing?? with nothing to say, stutterin and slurrin
And mutterin words with no meaning, attack me side I'm like 
Big Daddy Kane
Here I go again hammerin stammerin grammerin
And eat it like cheese, 
pass me the crackers please
I've got a craving

[Intro - Sample: Heart - Crazy on You]
Tell myself that I was doing alright
There's nothing left to do tonight
[Hook - Sample: Heart - Crazy on You]
But go crazy on you.. crazy on you!
Let me go crazy, crazy on youuuuuuuuuu-ohhhhhh
[Verse 1]
Can't you see what you do to me baby?
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick
You're truly the only one who can do this to me
You just make me get so crazy
I go
 
schizo
, 
I get so insane I just go schizophrenic
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanted sex
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit
Cause the next day we're right back at it
In the same exact pattern
What the fuck is the matter with us?
We can't figure out if
 
it's lust
Or it's love
 what's that that's attracting us to each other?
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin' bitch
But I stay and still stick it out with you
Even though I just hit you today
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you
Just cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am
Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises
Always pullin' devices out your purse little vibrators and dildoes
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore
You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma-ture
Than those other little hoes who just act like little girls
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'
You play your position you never step out of line
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept out of mine
I wonder what's on your mind,
 
sometimes they say love is blind
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign
Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved
Maybe cause we're crazy in loooove
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this
As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me
As much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire
You're my entire supply - gas, the match, and igniter
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table
If you were to break I'd fall on my face
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much
As I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage
But you're essential to me you're the air I breathe I believe
If you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be
You are the Kim to my Marshall you're the Slim to my Shady
The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie
You are the words that I'm lookin' for when I'm tryin' to describe
How I feel inside and the right one that just won't come to my mind
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me
The bitch who never took half
, 
the wife who never divorced me
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me
And no matter how much too much is never enough
Maybe because we're crazy in looooove
[Hook]

[Intro]
A lotta people ask me stupid fucking questions
A lotta people think that what I say on record
Or what I talk about on a record
That I actually do in real life or that I believe in it
Or if I say that I wanna kill somebody, that
I'm actually gonna do it or that I believe in it
Well shit, if you believe that, then I'll kill you
You know why? Cause I'm a criminal
[Verse 1]
My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge
That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez
Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest
Pants or dress
, 
hate fags? the answer's "yes"
Homophobic? Nah, you're just heterophobic
Staring at my jeans, watching my genitals bulging
That's my motherfuckin' balls, you'd better let go of 'em
They belong in my scrotum, you'll never get hold of 'em!
"Hey, it's me, Versace! Whoops, somebody shot me!
And I was just checking the mail, get it? Checking the 'male'?"
How many records you expecting to sell
After your second LP sends you directly to jail?
Come on, relax guy, I like gay men
Right, Ken? Give me an amen! (A-men!)
"Please Lord, this boy needs Jesus
Heal this child, help us destroy these demons
Oh, and please send me a brand new car
And a prostitute while my wife's sick in the hospital"
Preacher preacher! Fifth grade teacher!
You can't reach me, my mom can't neither
You can't teach me a goddamn thing cause
I watch TV and Comcast cable
And you ain't able to stop these thoughts
You can't stop me from topping these charts
And you can't stop me from dropping each March
With a brand new CD for these fuckin' retards
And to think, it's just little old me
Mr. Don't Give a Fuck still won't leave
[Hook]
I'm a criminal! Cause every time I write a rhyme
These people think it's a crime to tell 'em what's on my mind
I guess I'm a criminal! But I don't got to say a word
I just flip 'em the bird and keep going, I don't take shit from no one
[Verse 2]
Mother did drugs, hard liquor, cigarettes, and speed
The baby came out, disfigured ligaments indeed
It was a seed who would grow up just as crazy as she
Don't dare make fun of that baby cause that baby was me
I'm a criminal, an animal caged who turned crazed
But how the fuck you supposed to grow up when you weren't raised?
So as I got older and I got a lot taller
My dick shrunk smaller, but my balls got larger
I drink more liquor to fuck you up quicker
Than you'd wanna fuck me up for saying the word ______
My morals went thump when the president got oral
Sex in his Oval Office on top of his desk
Off of his own employee
, 
now don't ignore me, you won't avoid me
You can't miss me, I'm white, blonde-haired and my nose is pointy
I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die
In plane crashes and laughs as long as it ain't happened to him
Slim Shady, I'm as crazy as Eminem and Kim combined
, 
"the maniac's in"
Replacing the doctor cause Dre couldn't make it today
He's a little under the weather, so I'm taking his place
Oh, that's Dre with an AK to his face
Don't make me kill him too and spray his brains all over the place!
I told you Dre, you shoulda kept that thang put away
I guess that'll teach you not to let me play with it, eh?
[Skit]
[Robber] Aight look (Em: uh huh) just go up in that motherfucker
Get the motherfucking money and get the fuck up outta there
[Eminem] Aight
[Robber] I’ll be right here waiting on you
[Eminem] Aight
[Robber] Yo Em
[Eminem] What?!
[Robber] Don't kill nobody this time
[Eminem] Awwright… god damn, fuck…
(whistling) how you doin'?
[Teller] Hi, how can I help you?
[Eminem] Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal
[Teller] Okay?
[Eminem] Put the fucking money in the bag, bitch
And I won’t kill you!
[Teller] What? Oh my God, don’t kill me!
[Eminem] I’m not gonna kill you bitch, quit looking around…
[Teller] Don’t kill me, please don’t kill me…
[Eminem] I said I’m not gonna fucking kill you. Hurry the fuck up! [Eminem shoots teller —BOOM]
[Eminem] Thank you!
[Verse 3]
Windows tinted on my ride when I drive in it
So when I rob a bank, run out and just dive in it
So I'll be disguised in it
And if anybody identifies the guy in it, I'll hide for 5 minutes
Come back, shoot the eyewitness
Fire at the private eye hired to pry in my business
Die, bitches, bastards, brats, pets
This puppy's lucky I didn't blast his ass yet
If I ever gave a fuck, I'd shave my nuts
Tuck my dick in between my legs and cluck
You motherfuckin' chickens ain't brave enough
To say the stuff I say, so just tape it shut
Shit, half the shit I say, I just make it up
To make you mad so kiss my white naked ass
And if it's not a rapper that I make it as
I'mma be a fucking rapist in a Jason mask
[Hook]

Yo 'Pac
That's right, hehehe
Yo, I heard you got beat up by the police
Got a big fat lawsuit and everything
Yeah..
Niggas just wanna know
If you still gon' be on some crooked-ass nigga shit
[2Pac]
Please tell me what's a nigga to do, and it's true
Ain't nuttin new, so I do, what I can to get through
Now first they had me trapped and now I'm pissed
A loaded AK-47
 lay under my head so I don't trip
One motherfucker from the Underground
And Big Stretch buckin niggas if they fuck around
Yo why I got beef with police?
Ain't that a bitch that motherfuckers got a beef with me
They make it hard for me to sleep
I wake up at the slightest peep, and my sheets are
 3 feet deep
I guess it's hard for you to see
But now I'm pointin the finger at police
Instead of them motherfuckers blamin me
I got the right to bear a pistol
And when the punk motherfuckers get to trippin I got shit too
And maybe then you'll see the truth
But until then, I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
[Hook: 2Pac]
It's all up to you; but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; but until then
I gotta do what I do and stay a crooked nigga too
It's all up to you; but until then I gotta do what I do
And stay a crooked nigga too
And maybe then you'll see the truth; OOOH!
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too
[2Pac]
Y'know you really can't say that ya blame niggas
Fuck bein tame, set aflame, time to aim triggers
2Pac'll spark a revolution
, 
fuck the Constitution
I want my bucks for restitution
This time you got a bigger problem
Time to face the niggas from South Central, Oakland, Brooklyn and Harlem
And we ain't shootin at each other (fuck no!)
That's my motherfuckin brother, so Dave Duke, run for cover
And all the bitches from the Klan
Come feel the wrath of a black man that doesn't smoke crack
 and
I don't drink St. Ides (fuck that!)
Genuine Draft, ganja ganja, and my fuckin tec-9
They know they scared to see us sober
(ahhhhhhh) Cobra, and niggas'll take the world over
It's all up to you (up to you)
Blame the Korean.. (fuck that) or be a crooked nigga too
[Hook]
[2Pac]
Pardon me? Play like Jasmine Guy and try me
I'll be damned if I die, come look at the rage in my eyes G
They got my homies in a jail cell
And it's the Rebel and the Devil, and one of us is goin to Hell
I got the whole place covered, with loc'd out brothers
And nuttin but love for each other
So motherfucker make a motion
I give a fuck, slice you up, and throw your ass in the ocean
Temperatures drop;
 
see it's cool to shoot a nigga
But they hate it when we pop the cops
That's when they gettin petrol
You better watch your step or you'll be left on death row
But I learn to look ahead of me
Stay strapped watch your back keep your eyes on the enemy
We blowin up precincts and OOOH
You can't fuck with the crew, of crooked nigga too
[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
Yo, mic check, testing one, two, um.. twelve
Whattup whattup whattup!
 
(Outsidaz)
This is my dance song
; 
can you hear me?
(Rah Digga, Pacewon, Young Zee)
Alright, ay turn my headphones up
[Verse 1]
My favorite color is red, like the blood shed
From Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead
Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve
(“I can’t stand white people”)
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so
Shit I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe
I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show
I just remembered that I'm absent-minded
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it
I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit
Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit
I told the doc I need a change in sickness
And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list
You want to get high? Here, bitch, just sniff this!
[Hook]
Cum on everybody
 
(get down tonight)
[Verse 2]
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again
That's why I write songs where I die at the end
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck
And I was wavin' it at everybody screaming, "I suck" (I suck!)
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd
And yell out loud: "All y'all get the hell out now"
Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry
(But Eminem this is your record release party)
I'm bored out of my gourd
So I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard
Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket
One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage
And if you ever see a video for this shit
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit
Cause they think that I'm a mothafuckin' Beastie Boy
So I told em I was Mike D
They was like, "gee I don't know, he might be!"
I told em "meet me at Kid Rock's next concert
I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"
Peace out, then I jetted to the weed house
Smoked out til I started bustin' freestyles
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick
Made a couple of crank calls collect (*brrrrrrring, click*)
"It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"
I want to make songs all the fellas dub
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of
So just remember when I bomb your set
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset

[Curtains closing]
[Footsteps]
[Screech of microphone]
[Ken Kaniff]
Is this thing on?
Where'd everybody go?
Guess who's back?
Back again…
Ken is back, tell some…men
Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back, Rub my back…
Eh….Wait…..Hello?
Eh…..Goodnight

Duh, duh, duh, duh, duh, we still on?
Yo, is the mic on?
Check, check, check, aight its good, lets go on
Eminem (3)
Let's go, come on

[Hook]
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong, who got it going on?
You're dead wrong
[Verse 1]
Relax and take notes
 
while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke,
 
gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer
The hooker layer,
 
motherfucker say your prayers
"Hail Mary, full of grace"
Smack the bitch in the face,
 
take her Gucci bag
And the North Face off her back,
 
jab her if she act
Funny with the money, 
oh you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa,
 
kapeesha?
 
I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho,
 
swift fist like Camacho
I got so much style I should be down with the Stylistics
"Make up to break up"
 Niggas need to 
wake up
Smell the Indonesia,
 
beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit, just the two hits
Her hitting the floor and me hitting the clit
Sucking on the tits, had the hooker begging for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was humping around and jumping around
Jacked her then I asked her, "Who's the man?" She said, "B-I-G"
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo Big, you're dead wrong)
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
When I get 
dusted
, 
I like to spread the blood like mustard
Trust it, 
my hardcore rain leaves you rusted
Move over Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, huh
Leave you toothless, you'll kibbitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC
G's disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shooting babies, no ifs ands or maybes
Hit mommy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis, after she sucked the dick
I stabbed her brother with the icepick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Got your father hiding in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealing with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feeling it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab ya 'til you're gushy
, so please 
don't push.. me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen
The black demon, got the little hookers screaming
Because you know I love it young, fresh and green
With no hair in between, know what I mean?
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
There's several different levels of Devil worshipping
Horse's heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism
Animals, having sex with them
, 
camels, mammals and rabbits
But I don't get into that,
 
I kicked the habit
, I just
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fucking meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket,
 
I'm lying
I got a nine in my pocket, and baby I'm just dying to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My uzi's heavy as yours,
 
yeah you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall
 
will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor
With your body spread on the bedspread,
 
red on the wall
Red on the ceiling, red on the floor
, get a new whore
Met on the second, wed on the third, then she's dead on the fourth, I'm dead wrong
[Hook]

[Puff Daddy] Bad Boy baby
[Notorious B.I.G.] Yeah

Chorus: The Notorious B.I.G. & Puff Daddy
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
The weak or the strong
Who got it goin' on?
You're dead wrong
[Verse 1: The Notorious B.I.G.]
Relax and take notes
While I take tokes of the marijuana
Smoke
Throw you in a choke
Gun smoke, gun smoke
Biggie Smalls for mayor
The rap slayer
The hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers
Hail Mary, full of grace
Smack the bitch
In the face
Take her Gucci bag
And her North Face off her back
Jab her if she act
Funny with the money, oh, you got him mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya

I'm out like
"The Vapors"
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho
The head honcho

Cumacho
I got so
Much style, I should be down with The Stylistics
Make up to break up
Niggas need to wake up
Smell the indonesia
Beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit
Just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor
And me hittin' the clits
Suckin' on the tits

And your moms ain't, ugly, love
My dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House Of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jump-in Around
Jacked her, then I asked her, "Who's the man?"
She said, "B.I.G."
Then I bust in her E-Y-E (Yo B.I.G., you're dead wrong)
Repeat Chorus Twice
[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's several different levels to Devil worshippin': horse's heads
Human sacrifices, canibalism, candles and exorcism

[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
How many licks does it take to the center of my Tootsie Roll? (Or)
How many nuts to the center of your booty hole?
Hold on, shorty, cause I'm about to slap this groupie nigga
Jab this fluesy nigga, watch 'em bleed, then shit dookie, nigga
Spooky nigga, you gettin' skinny like you Pookie, nigga
Blood spill got you laggin' out like that soupie nigga
Smoke this Lucy nigga, time passin' on the frank mic
Watch 'em dyin' slow, then see ya skin, you start to change color
My goons lay the flood, leave you layin', drippin' blood
Then ended up fingerfuckin' your mother at a strip club
We dead wrong for how we gutter like how in the sudden
Fascinated how all of this street shit, we straight mother
Fuck it
We thug rugged to the tenth power
Like B.I.G. was listenin'
So Gimme The Loot for the past ten hours
Another dick
Hear the click of my gun cock
Same mentality when I was scheeming on a lunch box
Gimme that!
Twenty-focused and I'm sorry Campbell
I'm taking from you and your wife and run the baby Pamper (What?)
Repeat Chorus Til Fade

[VERSE 1:]
Za bluzgiem bluzg
, 
to rozpierdala mózg Ci
Idź się truj jak tym tytoniem od ruskich
Nawijam swój slang, nie kumasz? się bujaj man
To ja sprzedałem broń tym dzieciakom z Columbine
Jak Cobain robię PIF! PAF! CIKI BANG!
BAM! BAM! czy tam inny dźwięk, ale w Twój łeb
To rosyjska ruletka
, 
to ten naćpany poeta
To jak głośny pierd podczas kolacji przy świecach
Co mi przyświeca? całe zło tego świata
Zakładam swoją maskę i się uodparniam
Xer jest wiele, ale co z tym zrobię? nie wiem już
Jestem w niebie kiedy siekę i łaków wrzucam na ruszt
Mam kunszt, nie jak ten tłuścioch Szabasa
Który zjebał ze sceny jak jeden kawałek nagrał
Moja jest rapgra
, 
ja chodzący oryginał
Chowajcie się po kątach, bo DeeN zaczął już nawijać!
[Chorus:]
To ten zły! potworny!
 
GRRR!
 (
Moja maska!
)
Sprzedaję dzieciakom syf
, 
zacznijcie klaskać!
To chore bragga
, 
rozpierdalam, DeeN!
Nic nie pomaga, więc co robić mam? nie wiem!
X2
[VERSE 2:]
Obrażam Szabasę
, 
a on będzie na mojej płycie
Ja to mam tupet, ale chuj z tym
, 
idzie-
-my po swoje
, 
złoto dla zuchwałych
Nie ma co pierdolić od rzeczy jak w "Noc Kupały"
Chodź tu, mały, tatuś ma dla Ciebie prezent
Odezwało się moje bardziej chore ja jebie
Nie no, to taki dżołk, nie wczuwaj się za bardzo
Kradniesz mamie ciastka, nie dziw się że że Tobą gardzą
Nie za bardzo wiem co się teraz dzieje
Jestem zagubionym dzieckiem, które wciąż przed siebie biegnie
Ten świat to jak wielkie pole zboża
Ja wpierdalam się w nie z miotaczem ognia, wywołuję pożar
To chora orgia zwierząt w fontannie
Zabiorę Cię tam gdzie Cię raczej nikt nie znajdzie
Urwę Ci nogi jak sarnie
, 
to nie kopia
 
jak KaeN
To jest DeeN
, 
rozpierdalam ładnie!
[Chorus:]
To ten zły! potworny! GRRR! (Moja maska!)
Sprzedaję dzieciakom syf, zacznijcie klaskać!
To chore bragga, rozpierdalam, DeeN!
Nic nie pomaga, więc co robić mam? nie wiem!

, Whoo Kid
, let's go !
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one...
*Gunshot*

I'm possessed by evil demons that torture me while I'm sleeping
I keep dreaming of death and I'm hearing people screaming
The devil's spirit's trapped inside me and I want it out
I'm on the couch bleeding to death in a haunted house
With both of my wrists slit
, 
I'm lifted up in the air
And suspended in animation like someone's holding me there
I feel somebody's cold hands wrapping around my neck
While I choke on my own blood that I swallow and drown to death
But I found a breath and somehow managed to slip the clutches
Nearly blacking out from dizziness and head rushes
Tripping over OD'd bodies of dead lushes
Bloodstains paint the plush carpet like red blushes
Door's open and close by themselves
Books fly off shelves,
 
curtains catch fire, the house melts
My skin blisters and sticks together like
 
twin sisters
The wind blows and shatters windows like ten
 twisters
Caught a piece of shrapnel in the
 
Adam's apple
Two cups of holy water
 
and I'm looking at 'em half full
But as soon as I go to touch 'em they turn into
 
red rum
It got silent, then all these voices said
"Come follow me into the gates of Hell"
I heard 'em yell "Welcome to the Norman Bates Motel!"
I ring the bell for service and I was greeted by
 
his mother
Covered in dry blood
, 
head still dented from the shovel
I said I need a room so I could try to get some rest
She gave me the keys to the best suite and a
 
bag of cess
And told me that's just for starters, Satan'll be in to see me later
To see if I'm interested in being partners

[Intro: Proof]
Yo, ayyo turn the heads up and the mics up
We got the Dreadknaughts,
 y'knahmsayin
Super MC,
 y'knahmean
Bugz,
 
Dirty and all that, all that shit,
 y'knahmsayin
Desperados with the cars, Eminem
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Chauvinist pig, drove in this big Lincoln
Till it went over the bridge
Jumped out and dove in the ditch
Broke in a mobile home and stole a stove and a fridge
Kidnapped the parents and left the ransom note for the kids
I'ma go for your mids, here's a body blow for your ribs
While you're clutching your stomach and bleeding all over your bitch
I know where you live, your girl showed me your crib
Unless she told me a fib, then I'ma have both of ya did
Burning incense, facing a murder sentence
Under intense investigation for killing infants
While I sit in padded rooms doing shrooms
Having visions of dead pregnant women with brooms jabbed in they wombs
Slit your carpet and rugs and fuck your apartment up
Sticking it far with drugs, and jumping in garbage trucks
I'm from the shitty slums that look like the city dumps
Give you a kidney punch, and mug you to get me lunch
See me every summer laying up against the dumpster
With a hundred dollar jumper smothered in Southern Comfort
Got my Slim Shady sticker on your mother's bumper
She came home screaming, a bunch of motherfuckers jumped her
[Verse 2: Proof]
Ayyo, proceed to list em, there's no need to diss em
Down here we heat em, destroy your whole breathing system
Twist em like beer caps once they hear that
Rap murder rates, 
and I snap vertebrates
Collapse further states, my track preserve the great
Your pack deserve a crate, in fact the word is fate
I kill you slow like AIDS-infested nuts
I'm holding vendetta like seven great-molested sluts
Calling me a bitch nigga, you need to stop
Reality, one on one, how many times you got dropped?
I'm cutthroat when any track runs, conscious when I smack nuns
The rough neck that make Muslims run and pack guns
I'm volcanic, the sermon preacher
Burning emcees, most wanted by Herman Kiefer
You tried to get a squad, they was like "Money, oh no"
Leave you brain-dead, hitting trees with Sonny Bono
I kick without a dojo, D12 slow flow
Shoot down your mothership and pimp-smack mojo
No pro wanna go knuckle-blades with the renegade
Nigga tried to go pop, and plus they minute-made
My lieutenant sprayed your brigade and trampled your flow
Big P
, the reason emcees cancelled they show
The truth will hurt, seeing Proof at work, no shame in it
The best part of your show is when you put my name in it
My squad be godly, fearing shit hardly
So I hope when I'mma die, dope like Chris Farley
[Verse 3: Bugz]
Fuck that!
Who run shit once these drums hit?
You dove headfirst into some old dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip, for you to come get
Yo' click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you sucking one tit
Them pink belly niggas, is who you run wit
Making half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate yo' damn sound, don't like it one bit~!
You could make a double album, won't have one hit
Your entire outfit, is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad-mit, that my style is unfit
For momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
This egotistic Hip Hop fundamentalistic?
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existence
I'm persistent when it comes to bent shit
I smoke a, blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Yo' bitch paid my bill, that's where the hell yo' rent went
Fuck that!
[Verse 4: Supa Emcee]
I kill competition, with no way out as an opposition
Execute the passengers on the flight, my executive decision
Then reminisce on how Shady the business
Terrorists asked by Iraelis when they visit
Bombing incentive, World War Three in the making
Murdered the exhibition, team finish! Beat the ref senseless!
No timeout, extended play burns over your intermission
Then christen the battlefield with the blood of Christians
Crying for the messiah, but he don't listen
I pop my wig when I top the stove frame, boil sizzling
A pyromaniac cook, I do damage to kitchens
Fuck Home Depot, I demolition
When I home improve
, 
you need Bob here to fix it
Fuck school and supervision
Bit off of financial aid and smoked up my tuition
Only hang around rappers with explicit lyrics
And pistol-grip punks for the beefing, do you wanna get heated?
[Verse 5: Stilla Shellz]
I got a mind full of troubles, everything's in doubles
I buy my guns in couples, no time for placement fumbles
Cause emcees come and emcees go, with broke flow
Injured from head to toe, no fitter model, we full-throttle
You stuck in low, incapable to master flow
Everything is tactical, living mathematical
I smash the flow, unleash and let go
I shit like lava, original designer
Married to marijuana since a minor
Making attempts to sink my battleship could get you bent like fibs, what?
Applying death-defying feats, maintain to keep my peace
Flow like the sea when I release these beats over concrete
[Verse 6: 0-1]
My presidented transition has taken place
As I express vocally on the M-I-C-R-O
Power he's cipher, not equality, I deal it
Lace the track and made it real, now I know my people feel it
Keep their heads bobbing and the emotionals sobbing
Plus a culture-cipher after shows, hoes slobbing
Knobs, love the fucking flavor of the icing
Plus I'm precise and, my double edge continue slicing

[Verse 1]
Girl, you give me writer's block
I'm at a loss for words, uhh
My mind's as lost as yours
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge
Never seen no ass as large as yours
How much that cost? That's what I call the cost to splurge
You drive me bonkers, I’m about to get my swerve on for sure
Thought I was pimpin' 'til I felt like Nas, the first
Date cause I think I gave you power, when I gave you flowers in a vase
A box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs
Probably should've never let me call that job of yours
To talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work
Should've been one of the first signs to cause alert
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her
Cause nobody's body's awesomer, I lust it and she loves me
Cause I'm popular, but you know this ain't love
[Hook: Jamie N Commons]
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love
You know this ain't love, you know this ain't love (What is it then?)
It's desperation (She's looking for Mr. Right, wants me to be that guy to her)
It's desperation (I can't even put up a fight, cause I give in at the sight of her)
(And I here I go again)
[Verse 2]
You were obviously oblivious to me, I swore I was just invisible to you
Till I went to the lengths I did to meet you
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning
Now I'm in disbelief I, never knew that this could be such misery, ah
Cause now you see nothing but me, and I don't see nothing but you
And I'm about to flip cause we are super glued in
We stuck to each other's hips and we can't
Do anything individually, which is to cling on, scared to be alone
Can't, specifically describe it I just can't seem to give a reason
This definitive, just need you, talking bout I live and breathe you
And you pretend to be as mentally and physically
Addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer
Don't wanna be without you
Don't wanna be with you neither, bitch
Put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek
Cause this ain't love
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else
"What the fuck you whispering for?
You get on my nerves, you make me sick
I think our relationship, it seems to be on the fritz
I mean it's time that we just split and leave the
Games behind
 
your frame of mind ain't the same as mine
I think you need to finish developing a little more mentally too"
Get the picture
That's a negative, Alicia, I will never give the keys up
To the crib, ever again, no reason not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's
You better have an epiphany, slut, guess what? The lease up
I'm just mad the time it took to discover
You were using me for loot like I used you for looks
Oh, thought you was too good for me, huh? yeah
Toots, used to be my Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack
But I can't stomach this, I'm leaving you, I'm not coming back
She said, "The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?"
She grabbed that fucking bat and swung it at my head
I barely ducked and that's right
When she came up with a kick to the nuts twice, steel toe
Girl probably coulda put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights
[Hook]

I come around like what goes around,
 
what goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down,
 
might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breathe,
 
last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down, bitch, get fucked with a volume knob,
 
fuck all you snobs
Hoes, I hope all you rot,
 
two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms
Is that all you brought? And you want a ménage à trois, you twats?
Fuck that, I'd rather turn this club to a bar-room brawl
Get rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck in a vacuum y'all, ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking
Going on in rap,
 
yeah but I'm home
, 
bad to the bone
Back in the zone, let him alone, you don't want to go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you own, crown so tight that it cuts off
Circulation to the brain, no oxygen, other words, there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip-hop, Hitchcock of the shit bitch ask Doc
Doc got it ziplocked in a bag,
 
you fags ain't been able to fade me
Since Kid Rock had a high top
, 
keep bloggin' while I mind-boggle
And I zone like I'm in the twilight, dog
, 
get off my bone
This is my mic, doggonit
; 
I like hoggin' it
Flow's so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganin', I'm waterloggin' it
I'm soggin' it,
 
pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplexing it on cement
 
like I'm on some "Straight Outta Compton" shit
Take this dick and chomp on it,
 
I'm so bad I can bitch-slap
A back-handed compliment
, 
jackass, eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it, like Donkey Kong, I'm bonkers, bitch
I'm the king of this honkey shit
, 
I reign supreme in this honkey shit
No sense screaming and arguing
, 
makes no difference
Whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamer's the car you in
You think you ball? Well, I palm it,
 
I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy, I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omelette
But you got egg on your face,
 
now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
Bitch, I'm as batshit as Ozzy, it's obvious, you can tell right off the bat
No pun intended, but come any closer, I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the finger's kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I'll catch a fly in that bitch, you think you fly, you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that Superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do
 
and make you look stupid and bamboozled
Confused as usual and you can get whipped, she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat or stay the fuck
Outta Hell's kitchen
, 
I came to cock block like a square
Fucking male chicken
, 
yeah, it's Shady
, 
slut; the rest
Can suck on a big one,
 
cause I'm as despicable as Daffy Duck when I'm spittin'

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody
[Verse: Royce Da 5'9"]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he fuck with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, mothafucka
[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Boy I need no halves and halves, I want the game in entirety
100 percent cut, no stitches required
Welcome to Detroit where if you get that promotion
Don't worry, man them bullets will still be at your ass firin'
I still call it safe, I would suck if I was umpirin'
Boy I hit the beat I just treat that shit like a diary
I'm offended if you hear my new shit and you ain't rewindin' me
Self made, I never needed your bail or a wire, see
I'm never callin' collect, I call to collect
My homie wanted a Chevy so I put my dog in the vet
Plus I'm so loyal that that paper, boy, is all that I fetch
Got the ball in my hand and the ball in the net
Bitch I'm the D, can't no offense dunk on me
I'm Mr. Big Shot,
 
these hoes get drunk off me
I'm overrespected, my mama gated community's overprotected
So futuristic, I'm already over my next bitch
Reminiscin' on listenin' to 50 fifty times a day
Back when tenth grade was like fifty days away
Tryna get paid fifty ways a day
Used to put fifty on the layaway, now my closet fifty shades of grey
Twenty six and I done lived a lifetime a few times
From futons to Grey Poupons
In church tryna get a little savings, yeah coupons
I spit that A1 every day, I'm hittin' new primes
Now the stakes high,
 
niggas surprised at the new lines
Or takin' down my number like "you still ain't got a new line?"
Nah it's the same, we've been laborin' for years
I know it took way longer than nine months, but fuck it, it's all in due time
I turned a blunt to a roach with dreams of bein' a Beatle though
Don't want to, I need to, gotta learn to keep it cerebral
When you come up in a place where everyone got a piece but ain't peaceful
This is just part one, wait 'til the sequel
[Hook: Dej Loaf]
[Verse 3: Danny Brown]
Comin' from them streets where they thirsty, starvin' to eat
Just a step away from felon, that's why they call it the D
On your bleeder, ho, reason for all of this honesty
Honestly no honor roll, but honored up in these streets
Cause I'm a Linwood nigga,
 
them young niggas say
Put a stack on your head, you'll bleed a lake on Grand River
And to think y'all hood harder then I might beg to differ
Know some killers pull the trigger for a Swisher and Molly
In a blink I'll hit your kisser, bet you ass ain't rememberin'
They say my city's tougher than two fat bitches scissoring
So nigga I'm a veteran, retire my letterman
I had K's in front ya school, but I ain't go to Kettering
Cough up a line, 313 where I'm from
Xan got me cross eyed like Bernstein’s son
And these niggas try to copy but I hold on this time
It's us vs. them, Detroit vs Everybody
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my mothafuckin' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the shit
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the shit
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from,
 
rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and shit
But Jesus, I can just see why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, shit
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here
 
trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this shit, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' shit
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em
[Hook: Dej Loaf]
[Outro: Trick Trick]
What up though, it's the godfather Trick Trick. You either ridin' with us or gettin' rolled on. That means Detroit vs. Everybody! Hey Em let me get that instrumental take it down to the hood, let the little homies get this remix crackin'. Detroit!

[Slim Shady]
I make music to make you sick of fake music
Hate music like devil worshippin' Satan music
So say your prayers, your Hail Mary's and Jesuses
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix
Try to stop it but you can't do it
A whole generation of kids blowing out their fucking brains to this
Kurt Cobain music, students converted to 'caine users
As soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it
What's your name
[Swift]
Judas
Got my nine with six sharpshooters, now let's do this
I got niggas that shoots to static - you don't understand
How I'm all up in you niggas TV's like Carole Anne
I'm a poltergeist, lyrically I'm supposed to strike
Try to snatch this mic, you get cracked with Molson Ice
(Swifty get your own woman!)
 
I want his wife
I'm the type to go to gamblin' parties with trick dice
I rob casinos, slugs, eat those
You'd think it was the devil feedin' you jalapenos
Now you out of the scene hoes shot at your clean clothes
My fo'-fo', prone to make you niggas breathe wrong
[Hook: Slim Shady]
It's Devil's Night, da da dah, da-da da da dah
It's Devil's Night, da da dah, da-da da da dah duh da
Cause I came back to rule this time
It's Devil's Night, cause I came back to take what's mine
Yes it's Devil's Night, da da dah, da-da da da dah
It's Devil's Night, da da dah, da-da da da dah duh da
Cause I came back to rule this time
It's Devil's Night, cause I came back to take what's mine
[Kon Artis]
It's like I'm on the john
, tryin' to shit and get no response
 bitch, tell these pigs to back off
The mind of rapist, Denaun never changes
Beat up strangers without a reason, I'm a anus
Walk the street in a "Beat It" jacket with a glove to match it
Drop the hat shit I put my head on opposite and 
 backwards
Walking zombied it's ornery
Pulling armed robberies on politicians without a sense of camaraderie
[Kuniva]
Yo, I can concoct the nine 
, plus I run with the best
Hop on a motorcycle, busting wheelies over your chest
Bystanders standing by
, thinking oh what a mess
Blast through every 
hickie
 that them 
 put on your neck
What the fuck do you expect, when the slugs are dealt
And make you feel every ounce of pain that Bugz done felt
A deranged team, smoking ganja greens
This car beam'll make your fuckin' head shake like tambourines
I pledge allegiance to the streets of the D
And if you think you out cold, catch a piece of this heat
And when it blast, it'll take off every piece of your scream
From her barettes to her cheeks to her cute little feet
[Hook]
[Bizarre]
Stop takin' drugs, I'm tryin'
My little boy is dyin', he losin' too much iron
And if I die, it won't be because I got shot
It'll be because I tied my arm in a sock and smoked rock
Takin' drugs is cool, that's why I buy 'em
Shoot 'em up my 
, let your 
 try 'em
Ten years is what I'm facing
Police breakin' in my house, 
Lil' Bow Wow in the basement
(Jermaine!) A rapist that'll bust in your mouth
I'll probably be in jail 'fore this fucking 
 comes out
I'm eighteen years old, still shit in the bed
Beaten 'til I'm red, fear nothing but war and bread
It's me again, fucking dirty jinn
So what if it burns, bitch when I stick it in
No medication, I'm out of percocet
I lost my weed, plus my fucking diaper's wet
[Hook]
[Slim Shady]
It's Devil's Night

[Hook: Eminem] [2x]
I sit into the wee hours of the night
And we don't stop until the sunlight
We just keep going cause the die hard
Won’t go down without a fight
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
My life is like a highlight reel
Some might consider this my twilight but depending how I might feel
I might continue on with my career for 5 light years
Critics can fly kites here?
Welcome to my nightmare
Pressures on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step, pacin’
Don’t know if I’ll meet expectations
All I know is the World better get set
Dre’s in effect
Been in it since you had cassette decks taping
I’m sick
[Hook: Eminem] [2x]
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
It’s on, blood pressure racing
I calculate my next step which is to accept my expectations
They're soaring too high to meet, 
my reputations in jep
’
Yep, face it, the fans they’ve been upset yet patient, I love ‘em for that
[Hook: Eminem] [2x]

[Verse 1]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me, what the fuck good does
That do me now, but somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dog you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
If it's true how the fuck am I supposed to get over you, difficult as it sounds
[Hook: Obie Trice]
[Verse 2]
Doody, that's what we call each other, I don't know where it came from
But it just stuck with us, we was always brothers
Never thought about each other's skin colours
'Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees I was catching a sun burn
Tryna walk under the trees just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home when I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like you gonna fry and you're like, "No I won't, I'm black stupid
Black people they got
 
melatonin
In their skin don't burn," meanwhile my face is glowing and I felt
Like I'm on fire and the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them 
Playboy rings
, 
my mother stole from you
Well 
Nate
 
finally got 'em back shit
It musta been at least 16 years ago
, well I put 'em in your 
cask-oww
Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
The Motor City,
 
Motown,
 
hip hop vet
, 
Hip Hop Shop,
 
dreads
It don't stop there
, yeah, as difficult as it sounds
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
And this might sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding and I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all me and D12 we feel like fuck rap
It feels like our general just fucking died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed
Our two-ways are in the trash so some cats will have to find a new way
And I know the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is they're all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang
, 
you gotta keep pressing on
Don't ever give up the dream dog, I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker Doody, I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen, believe me
I know you're the one who taught me to throw them bows back on Dresden
From making cars to paintballing and getting arrested
To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin'
Me, you and what's his face, I forgot his fucking name
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'mma punch him in the fucking face
And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot
Of 54 just before we were supposed to get in cars
To come and see you
, 
once more difficult as it sounds
[Obie Trice]
Dudey!

[Eminem]
Good morning children!
My name is Dirty Steve, I'll be your substitute teacher for today
(Clinton Sparks!)
Come with me, don't be so mad, angry little man
Dirty Steve will be here soon, he will hold your hand
Walking through the forest, he will show you porno mags
You can beat his dick while he sucks yours
, cuz he's a fag

[Verse]
Come here spittin' with non written
Non fiction
Rappers try to step to this with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashing and bashing and crashing
I hate rappers with a passion
 
when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' Kleenex or I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chilling with Phoenix
With two Coronas
 I'm on the microphone and I'mma own this
Yo and I'mma bone this
In Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable
I'm on two turntables
With my man
But he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only 5'4"
Yo check it out, I bust rhymes and get groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter he wasn't insulted
He said "I'm 27 years old. Yo, I'm an adult kid."
But yo, still
Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'mma always gonna build and kill
My baby's mama just to piss the world off
Just to piss the girl's off
Yo, I hurl off
The top of the building
Kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrist's tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it
Yo, y'all couldn't conceive it
It's Slim Shady
I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out and you can keep it
Just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret
Like Pop Secret
Rappers, they don't wanna see
Slim Shady
, 
I'm from the motherfuckin' D

[Eminem]
Hailie, what do you want to be when you grow up baby
[Hailie]
I don't know
But I don't want to grow up to be like Ja Rule's little dirty-ass kids
[Eminem and Hailie]
Ah ha, yeah, c'mon
G-G-G-G-G-G-G Unit
Hailie, come here baby, bring Daddy his Oscar
We're gonna shove it up Ja Rule's ass
[Swift]
I'm about to get rid of some hoes, it's simple
I'm quick to murder ink with lead and I ain't talkin' bout a pencil
Look at what the fuck you done got into
I see you found your niche, you just a bitch with a menstrual
Claimin' you a murderer and you spelled it wrong
You put E before the D cause that's all you on
You on Pac's dick, you a replica guy
If he was still alive you would never get by
All you do is cry, bitch keep it real
Life is more than imitatin' niggas and eatin' pills
And what kind of motherfucker ruins three deals
That another nigga got you, they didn't see skills
And I ain't playin', you a brother gettin' cheated
And Ja Rule be prayin' on his cover cause he need it
And all you niggas hatin', shut you mouths
It's just that real niggas ain't buyin' that shit y'all put out
[Obie Trice]
Doe, rae, me but we don't sing motherfuckas
So Murder Inc do your thing motherfuckers
You unleashed on a team who expects nothin' less
Than R&B comin' from that regime
Regime is a little extreme
Neck and neck with soldiers, motherfuckin' Marines
Ja sold his soul to sing
Weave eye-witness team on the TV screen, chase the greed
Now that you've embraced the green
Don't fuck with the triple beams
You's a motherfuckin' actor, slash Pac impersonatin' rapper
Slash Billie Holiday, how it happen
Artist and repertoire saw him in action
Pac assassination, Def Jam grabbed him
Told him reenact him, you go platinum
They seen it for sure, I know that Afeni Shakur
Don't enjoy Jeffrey Atkins reenactin' her boy
So I'm click-clackin' this toy
Mash and destroy, Shady slash Aftermath and Detroit, mothafucker
[Hook: Eminem]
Doe rae me, fa-so-la-ti-da
Don't blame me cause you washed up lost your spot
Mama-say-mama-sa-ma-macosa
Ja quit playin', knock it off, you're not 2Pac
Don't hate me, I'm too hot and you're not
Shooting at me, with the only shot you got
Ja quit playin' knock it off you're not 2Pac
You'll get popped poppin' all that shit you pop
[Kuniva]
Now we can get past the mean mugs and get to the slugs
To the grievance and the crying and the intimate hugs
We don't take you serious nigga, you shook you half of a half-way crook
Get off X dick, go sing a hook nigga
And you can't replace the late great one
And when you gone you only gon' be the late fake one
Nigga please, stick to the script
Before the guns stick to the clip
And Benzino you ain't shit but a bitch
Fuckin' old-ass ignorant innocent lookin' senior citizen
Built up, slap you like Grimace, all sensitive
Wait a minute, hold on
Is it me or do he look like a banana with braids and clothes on
A bitch-made man
Now how you gonna connect with them short ass arms like a Tyrannosaurus Rex
You niggas can scream holler and curse
Go ahead and respond and pull that pen and pad up outta your purse
[Proof]
Slim didn't send Proof to get at the wankstas
He told me to let loose and spit at the gangstas
What up Gotti, and this little war you pushed on
Put your ear to the ground for stepping on bush stones
What's wrong, didn't think we strong with real niggas
Roll like a boss in the streets they still feel us
It's real business y'all ain't caught the concept
You talkin' nonsense to walking bomb threats
Contact was blown by Benzetta in The Source
Threaten at the boss you gon' see me on your porch
Now Irv got the nerve to try to serve on us
But 
Detroit niggas
 
early and ain't scurred to bust
[Kon Artis]
Word to my nigga Bugz, punks like you get beat up
Stomped unconscious and smacked with the heater
This rap cookie monster gets jabbed in the tonsils
With dicks so much that he should be fixed with a vagina
Who's behind you
Cadillac Pac or that transvestite
That dress like a Lil Kim fox
You're just like a little windbox
Press tight on the trigger of this Glock
Swallow that little shit you got left to help you eat
You knock Pac's songs without love to help you sleep
You got shot in your video trying mock Pac
You Mockaveli, get your own identity
[Hook (Refrain in background)]
Don't you never say my little girl's name in a song again
Fuckin' punk-pussy bitch
I'll fuck you up boy
Never
Don't you never in your motherfuckin' life
I'll choke the shit out of you little motherfuckin' midget
Hailie'll whip your motherfuckin' ass
[Outro- Obie Trice]
That's right motherfuckers
Shady records, whatchu know about it
Fuck Benzino, fuck Ja Rule
Nigga, this Obie Trice right here talkin' to you motherfuckers
Ja Rule punk ass, yeah
Fuckin' Soul 4 Real ass
Nigga, that's Soul 4 Real
That the nigga from Soul 4 Real
Candy Rain-ass nigga

[Hailie]
Daddy, is Ja Rule taller than me?
[Eminem]
No honey, you guys are the same size

[Intro: Xzibit & Eminem]
[X] Pssh, man I need a lighter man
[E] Right here
[X] Yeah.. whassup Slim
[E] What's cracking
[X] Hit this shit
[E] Shit, I almost hit this motherfucker today
[X] Psh, is that right?
[E] What is it with motherfuckers thinkin that
[E] {*SIGH*} because we're in the spotlight or whatever that
[E] they can do or say whatever they want to us
[E] and that we won't retaliate
[X] Protect my motherfuckin self, by ANY
[Both] MEANS, NECESSARY
[E] Right
[Hook: Eminem]
Cause you don't know me, I don't know you
So don't approach me, I won't approach you
And don't insult me, I won't insult you
Cause you don't know what I will or I won't do
[Verse 1: Xzibit]
Make no mistake, I'm the Golden State heavyweight
Being underrated gave me time to create it
Can you relate?
 
I renovate, straight out the gate
Carried my weight, but seem to receive nothin but hate
Millionaires snatching crumbs off my little son plate
Kidnapped, locked in a trunk, get shot in the face
No hoes, no clothes, no one showin up for my shows
You know how it goes; 
I might as well kick it at home
But my baby momma hate my guts and can't stand me (yeah)
Packed up, moved out, started a new family
So all this strugglin' for what, so I can blow up
Marry a slut but can't watch my seed grow up
Fuck that, 
this the fucking thanks I get
For tryin to 
edutain
 assholes and feed my bitch?
Yo I feel like my whole life is upside down (upside down)
Cause you seeing more support than I'm seeing my child
It's like
[Verse 2: Eminem]
...
Everyday I wake up, another drama
It's a wonder I'm alive, surviving this karma
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her
Without these cameras in our faces like animals
For your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulance up the avenue
And catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts
And what we do in private, since they won't let us put up a fence
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun
Whether it's unloaded, full, or an unregistered one
No bullets? You're so full of shit
This clip is so full, it'll spit if I don't pull it
And don't give me no bullshit, I'm not in the mood
I just got in a feud in some parkin' lot with a dude
Over Kim, and she just slit both of her wrists over this shit
Don't tell me 'bout the show business shit
I know what this is, bitch
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Xzibit]
This ain't business, this is personal, bitch
You don't know Xzibit from shit, new school, class dismissed
I had a very fucked up day, I'm needing this fit
Shutting motherfuckers up like they pleadin' the fifth
Yo, Em, it's time to get serious with it
Time for everybody to feel it, similar to the egg in the skillet
This is your brain on drugs, Xzibit brain on thugs
Ain't no neighborhood that's big enough to bang on us
Ain't no love lost, my niggas, relax yourself
I'm about to snatch it all and start spreading the wealth
To my niggas who never seen it I mean it when I holla
At the top of my lungs about my guns and my loved ones
Got tons of ammo to crack your enamel
Changing your channel, you played like a fucking piano
Riding slow through Cali like I'm riding a camel
Millionaire motherfuckers with their brains in their flannels
I feel like Tony Soprano, who do I trust now
Just hit me on my 
tele'
 nigga soon as I touch down
Spit lines to split spines, just to get mine
Big behind bitches getting dick to spit shine
Sniff lines of coke, that's the only shit that make you dope
Bitch-ass nigga that's droppin' the soap
Get choked out and beat, put your head in a vise-grip
And turn til you motherfuckers tell me the right shit
[Verse 4: Eminem]
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself
A front door with twelve locks
And have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox
And every time somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots
And one in the chamber, gun in the waist
And one in the ankle, waitin' for someone to come to my place
Tryna walk up and knock, like these cocksuckers are not
Gonna get a shotgun or a Glock shoved in their face
And it's a disgrace Hailie can't play with her toys
In the front yard, without you drivin' by, honkin' your horn
Screamin' some shit, leanin' out your windows, beepin' and shit
Or pullin' up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live
So my address ends up on the Internet again
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin' them
That if someone comes to my crib, I'mma shove a gun in their ribs
And reporters blow it out of proportion
Oh, now he's pullin' guns on his fans
Just for tryin' to stand on his porch
And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like, hey, hi
You guys wants some autographs, okay, form a straight line
Sometimes I feel like loading this rifle
And climbin' the roof at night and hidin' outside to snipe you
It's not that I don't like you
It's just that when I'm not behind the mic
I'm a person who's just like you

[Intro]
DMC, we have a mid-thirties male found down, unresponsive
Possible overdose, substance unknown
, 
pulse is sixty and thready
Respiration's eight,
 
he's intubated and we're baggin' him now
BP, ninety over palp
, 
patient is cool, pale and diaphoretic
Has aspirated
, 
GSC is three,
 
we'll update en route, ETA, ten minutes
[Verse 1]
As I, fall deeper into a manic state
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate
Start off with the night well like, I think I'll just have a taste
Couple of sips of that then I gradually graduate
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like, yeah that's great
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos
 
and I'll have a steak
And you'd think that with all I have at stake
Look at my daughter's face
Mommy something is wrong with dad I think
He's acting weird again, he's really beginning to scare me
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat
[Hook]
Sometimes I feel so alone, I just don't know
Feels like I been down this road before
So lonely and cold, it's like something takes over me
As soon as I go home and close the door
Kinda feels like déjà vu
I wanna get away from this place I do
But I can't and I won't
Say I try, but I know that's a lie
Cause I don't and why I just don't know
[Verse 2]
Maybe just a nice cold brew, what's a beer
That's the devil in my ear
I been sober a fuckin' year
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fuckin' hear
"Marshall, come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"
And maybe if I just drink half I'll be half buzzed
For half of the time, who's the mastermind behind that little line
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind
To have another half of glass of wine
, 
sound asinine
Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol
Ouch, look out for the wall, aim for the couch - I'm 'bout to fall
I missed the couch and down I go lookin' like a bouncy ball
Shit musta knocked me out cause I ain't feel the ground at all
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I
Man, fuck am I hungover and goddamn I
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I
All systems ready for take off, please stand by
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
So I take a Vicodin, splash it hits my stomach then, ahhhh
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm gettin' high
Now I need it just not to feel sick,
 
yeah I'm gettin' by
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if
 
DeShaun didn't die
Oh yeah, there's an excuse
, 
you lose Proof so you use
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin' you to get through
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducin' a snooze
What else is new,
 
fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes
Now here I am three months later, full blown relapse
Just get high until the kids get home from school holmes, relax
And since I'm convinced that I'm an insomniac
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see
That's an Ambien each nap,
 
how many Valium, three
And that will average out to about one good hour's sleep
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia thing?
It was bologna, was it the methadone ya think?
Or the hydrocodone you hide inside your pornos
Your VCR tape cases, with your Ambien CR
Great places to hide 'em, ain't it?
 
So you can lie to Hailie
I'm goin' beddy bye Whitney baby, good night Alaina
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door
 
and wake up in an ambulance
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn
[Hook]

[Hook]
Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out
Don't come down things will always work out
So when you find yourself in pieces
[Verse 1]
As a child I was foul
Ma, I couldn't understand them things that came out your mouth
(Daddies ain't shit)
You would fuss, cuss 'til your blood pressure was up
Then give up and slouch on the couch and drink your liquor
(Fuck you boy)
A hard-headed nigga I was, quick temper
Short attention span not attending class
What a dummy, I would run over you honey
You confront me and say Obie you no longer have a Mommy
Don't use my phone, don't even eat my food
Matter of fact, don't speak and it was just me and you
In the house, with that mouse and them traps and that gat
Waiting on the day for you to pull the trigger back
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
You trying to kill me boy, that's what you wanna do kill me
Ma you're not feeling me, the beef is not that drastic
Weed blasted bastard, you're lying (You're lying!)
You tuck plastic freezer bags with dope inside of em
She knew, but she hated that it was true
I done raised two boys, I can do away with you
The locks changed, and the nights got colder
I'm slanging boulders, looking like a boulder toker
But fuck it, I'm the Obster, I'm down for mines Ma
She ride by my corner like, I'm not gonna cry
I would not reap the pain of watching my youngest man
On the corner slanging 'cane,
 
fucking calling the cops
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Ma, even though I left the house wrong
Seventeen years old on my own, using these streets as my home
There's no reason to prolong this beef dear, I love you
Ms. Eleanor Trice I place no one above you
You the reason when I hustle, I knew to stack
The reason when I opened up mics I knew to rip
The ethics you enstored in this hectic young brother
Rubbed off after all, now look at your boy
When they ask about me now you won't just put your head down
Straighten up Ma, you can smile now proud
Everything's kosher with the boasterest Obster
Let's get closer, so regrets never approach us
[Hook] (2X)

[Verse 1]
Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest
Pencil is full of insolent bullets
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pitbull and a Rott'
Mixed with a toxic,
 
the plot begins to thicken
I begin to spitting like vintage Pac,
 
demented
Demonic sinister, ever since the the Doc replenished me
The day he gave me that shot when I was just 'bout to quit
So to not see him with me would be a shocking image
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is
Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics
Know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish
Eat me brocoli, spinach, cocky? Nope
But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this
And put emphasis on the "dope," so when names come up
In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow
You won't find anywhere,
 
when it fires and I unload my pen explodes
'til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it
In school I was so shy, timid
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member
Begging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause they were new
St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted
But kissed them old days, adios, I did it
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic
Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument
Cause you know I'll win it,
 
name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front
[Hook: Buckshot]
You know I got you open, kid, don't front
You know I got you open, word, don't front
You know I got you open, kid, yo why you fronting?
You know I got you open, kid
[Verse 2]
Rest in peace to Big Proof, you was a beast, you lyrically mirrored me
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowing through me
I love you, Doody, without you I feel so incomplete
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne
Better watch the fucking tone that you speak,
 
feel like I'm in the zone
I'm in a whole different league on my mothafuckin' own, it's just me
No opponents can compete,
 
and I've never been known to retreat
From beef, be beat, follow trends or wallow in defeat
I'm still hungry as fuck, but can't even say bon appétit
Cause I don't know what to eat, fucking microphone or the beat
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine
It's nose to the grindstone time, holmes,
 
your mind's blown
Cause I rhyme like I'm still trying to get signed
, 
up in the Ebony Show-
-case with Denaun screaming "Who the fuck passed you the mic?"
Never asked you like my shit from the get
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch
You had you a nice run, now take a hike
I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first
Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers
The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?
You don't like it? Suck a cock!
 
Almost forgot
Before I signed with the Doc, I almost signed with Duck Down
Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers, so mothafuck Loud
They jerked me around so what's up now?
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound like
Rubbing it and holding some grudge now, but don't front
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Late at night, used to catch a buzz, couldn't write
Now I write the type of shit to make you wipe
But wear diapers cause you might leave a streak
I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe
It's hard to decipher what cypher I might jump into tonight
Cause I'm hyper or something, needing someone or something is lighting
This fire under me, it's breathing new life
, 
it's like I already died once
I guess some people only live twice,
 
and it's funny
My days of being broke was so long ago, I lost my concept of money
But you dimes won't get a fucking nickle from me
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee
I'm having a stroke of genius, Elizabeth I'm coming to you, honey
From boy to man, and still make a whore moan like a thyroid gland
I'm in another category, man, don't put me up with them pop stars
I never needed a pat on the back to get at a boy, band
No offense? Yes offense, precedents has been set that'll never get met
Middle finger pressed against Moby's nose
Shouts to Obie, the curtains closed on my show
(But never forget that I'm the one you thought wouldn't make it)
You can't take it, oh
Got a whole generation of rappers coming up that are nutty with the flow
But convince me you've heard
An MC since me who's as good with the fucking mincing of words
Without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve
Whose mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn
It'll be like my skin being Indian burned
Hah, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?
Never been served if memory serves
I'd battle that 'til my own recollection remembers these words
[Outro: Buckshot]
You know I got you open kid, stop fronting
You know I got you open, 
Word Life

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Pictures of plenty
Sippin' my 
glass full of henny
Hands on my 
semi-
Automatic
 kill for pennies
Approach for contact
Cause I'm live I multiply
Soon as I open fire
Niggas die wit' open eyes
Scare to take a nap
It's a trap a long maze
Dreamin' of gettin' stacks
Makin' scratch the wrong way
What the song say
We murder motherfuckers daily
Black out blow the track out
My lyrics neva fail me
[Verse 2: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it
And you can love and you can hate it
But you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant
But you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm fronting man you better come confront me for it
[Verse 3: Notorious B.I.G.]
The pin stripes and the gray (uh-huh)
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt
I'm sewing tigers on my shirt
And alligators
Ya wanna see the inside, huh, I see ya later
Here come the drama, oh
That's that nigga wit the fake, blaow!
Why you punch me in my face
Stay in ya place
Play ya position, here come my intuition
Go in this nigga pocket
[Chrous: 2Pac]
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
Don't go to sleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Often, it's a young nigga, in a coffin
Tryin blossom, got shot down walkin, heh
Bleek a high to hot guy, turned cold
Bring the body bag, see the bullet hole and a burned soul
Don't cry, he chose the life
Fast lane, in the brain, he supposed to fight
How you smile at a momma when she lost a child?
[Verse 5: 2Pac Shakur]
I inhale strong weed then release the stress
Deliver the bomb shit from the east to west
Like yay-yo
Nigga's pull out when I say so
Commence to poppin' motherfuckers copy it fatal
Efficiently I delete then flee
The art of war
Livin' sucka free
Get wit' me
Motherfucker don't sleep
[Hook: 2Pac]
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep
You can get ya cash on nigga if ya peep
Other niggas close they eyes
Seein' dreams in they sleep
But don't fall asleep

[Produced by Eminem]
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I need you to pray for me and
I need you to care for me and
I need you to want me to win
I need to know where I'm heading cause I know where I've been
The flow is bone crushing, it's nothing, I come up with something
Come through your strip fronting, stunting
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners
Haters hate that I'm winning
Man, I've been hot from the beginning
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy
Cause I can't control my temper, I'm finna catch a felony
Pistol in hand, homie, I'm down to get it popping
Once I squeeze the first shot you know I ain't stopping
'Till my clip is empty, I'm simply
Not that nigga you should try your luck with or fuck with
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smoking, still locing
What nigga, lay your ass down, paramedics get you up feeling
[Hook: 50 Cent]
Right now I'm on the edge so don't push me
I aim straight for your head so don't push me
Fill your ass up with lead,so don't push me
I got something for your ass, keep thinking I'm pussy
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I done lost my bigger nigga and I didn't cry
To young to understand the consequences of a man
Living a lie, I gotta get that money
I'll be damned if I'm bummy
Gotta watch my back around these niggas cause they funny
20 years of watching my mama's tears got my heated, heavily weeded
Smoking that bomb cause I need it
These niggas don't want me balling, they want me buried
Bogged in the dirt from shots flurried
Laying with bugs under my shirt
I got plans to hop up in that Hummer
Cause I'm a stunner,
 
I sit back and wonder
When them angels gonna call my number under
Under my chest is a heart of a lion
I ain't lying, bounty hunters got me flying
With my iron, high as a giant
I'm running from nothing, my stomach is touching what I'm clutching
To give you more than a concussion, end of discussion
My blood is colder so I'm bolder
Hennessy and soda
, hood on my shoulder
Look in the mirror, I see a soldier
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
These are my ideas, this is my sweat and tears
This is shit that I saw with my eyeballs, my ears
This is me, who's gotta be what you see on TV
What you hear on CD, what appears easy
Man these teenie boppers see me on these magazine covers
In these beanies and these rags living fantasies
Fronting like it's all fun and games 'til the shoot 'em up bang
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playing
Ain't saying we ain't laying down at night and ain't praying
I bullied my way in this game, man, I'm done playing
Man, I'm done saying that I'm done playing
I'mma start laying into these motherfucking cocksuckers
There's no way I'm back down like a god damn coward
I can't, how would I look as a man bowing to his knees?
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me
And not lash back out at 'em, please
Oh, whoa, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart
So I see I have to start, showing you fucking old farts
A whole other side I wanted to not show you
So you know you're not dealing with some fucking marshmallow
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, whose heart's Jello cause
[Hook]
[Outro]
Shady Aftermath, nigga,
 
G-Unit
Rap juggernauts of this shit, we taking over

I ain't got time for this, man I'm out
[Hook: Dido samples from "Do You Have a Little Time", no 'Pac ad-libs first use]
You should stop, for a while
You will find me standing by (don't you trust me)
Over here, at the side, of your life (it's not that I don't trust you)
You spend all your hours just rushing, around
Do you have a little time
To have a little time for me
?
(
not that I don't trust you)
[2Pac]
As soon as I leave the house you wanna page me
See you got me trapped I'm goin crazy this is slavery
You act like it's outrageous, just give me space and we'll get better
And maybe we won't argue and be through with all these sorry letters
Soon as I come home it's like I get the third degree
Where you been and who you wit, I get no room to breathe
It makes me wanna leave, I'm sick of these tricks up your sleeve
Your suspicious I deceive, gimme grief when poppa leave
But to me, if you really trust me then it's pitiful
Question me about my whereabouts, that's so trivial
Let me live my life and you can live yours
Just be there to help me and support me that's what you're here for
Not to give me stress and add to pressure
Home is where I go to rest, I go to pass the test
I'm sorry if I left you all alone
But I couldn't make it home, so we argue on the phone
Don't you trust me?
[Hook]
[2Pac]
Callin at my house then hangin up, you think that makes sense?
Tell me what it takes for us to shake so we can be friends
It's time for us to take our seperate paths
We had a lot of laughs but the good's become the past
Let's make it an even break, don't make it scandalous
Try and be mature, I'm pretty sure that we can handle this
You're sayin I'm too busy, I ignore you
I guess you didn't hear me when I said that I, cared for you
But now it seems the arguments are nightly
I wanna hold you tightly but instead you wanna fight me
So why let it stress and aggravate me
Instead I'd rather break, hope you don't hate me
You tell me that you love me but you're lyin
Fightin back the urge to just start cryin
I'll wipe away your tears, come and hug me
I love you like you love ME, girl, but don't you trust me?
[Hook]
[2Pac]
I hang up the phone, I can't bear to hear you yellin at me
Maybe we should end it, neither one of us are happy
You know that I'm emotional, you know me
Comin over cryin just to get me feelin guilty
You and me were meant to be and yet
You always wanna sweat, how much closer can we get
Don't fret, just let me pack my things and I'll be outtie
This time I'm breakin out, you let your mouth overcrowd me
I can't take the beefin and the griefin
I get no room to sleep, I hope to see some cause I'm leavin
Maybe next time you'll be a little more sure
And I can give you more when you mature
But baby until then I gotta leave ya
It's not that I don't need ya but SEE YA
And I hope you understand why I'm bustin
Not because we bust our love, hah, don't you trust me?
[Hook]
[2Pac]
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you
Don't you trust me?
It's not that I don't trust you

[Verse 1]
Listen strictly for the low beat
Acclivity shifts up your lobe steep
What a minute ago was just low key
Is fixing up slowly to blow free
From your soul deep, it's a soul thing
It's a privelege to witness the whole thing
But I don't think anyone knows what it means
Like me to get lost in the moment like Bo Peep's sheep
Random letters of the alphabet scramble
And travel in passels on down to the mandible
Where they're tasked with and addled to
Unravel the prattle that I've managed to plaster but can't cause it's that tough!
So they back up, in an orderly fashion
Dismayed, they try to find a way to arrange
To break with the same born-to-be passion
But they can't seem to coordinate fast enough
So they just get in a formation and blast off!
Like the colonization of a rocket or spaceship
The polonization of a poppy or daisy
They pop from their casing and foster new babies
Make a beautiful mess like Pollock's paintings
And every little A, B, or C fits into the ground like a planted seed
What flourishes from the word pieces is reminiscent of a Disney fantasy
And the people that have witnessed seem stumped
Look at me like I got three thumbs
Because, to craft such a masterpiece would take at least
Two digits in addition to a green one
, and I'm free from
Doubt that the things I think of to speak of
Won't be redubbed for at least some
Time until another me comes, please just be done because...
[Hook]
I am dope
And I don't mean to gloat but I know what I know
And I know what you think
And you would never promote me
Because how would it look if they thought I was dope
And for those of ya'll you don't know what it means to be dope
I can teach you so, so let me demonstrate, listen close...
[Verse 2]
Maybe if I could do a handstand while chewing tobacco and shooting fast raps
They'd finally pay attention to me at last like the kind you might give to a tutor in class
But who would do that? That's like shooting a cat: an amusing experience but not good for your rep
And any guy who can't freestyle is as much a gift to the game as poop in a bag
It's very competitive, scary but definitely a fun sport like daring a veteran
To square with a pelican or spearing an elephant: entertaining for now, but who bears the penitence?
What does it matter? It doesn't matter! It's just a dumb meta-phor for the metra-
Nome in four/four apportioned to four quarter beats to conform to the pattern
Honestly right now I'd rather be writing a sonnet but the community wanted to see how I'd profit
Just using my talents on the lyrical side of the generic mosh pit
, so I'm on it...
Scribbling phrases I pray will be taken as ill and amazing insistent for praising
Fill in the blank in a billion ways to describe the way I make the beat titillating
But if you think my dopeness ends at my poems, friends, you better go check to see if you have broken senses
I've been known to get on a piano and shred the keyboard until there's no keys left
I don't need to go in depth, skip the tricks
Give me any instrument
, with it I'll rip it like Clint's pistol
I'm about to blow like a sick kid into a tissue
I stick with my family, more positives than the tip of a battery
Glib and happily, I'm gifted in managing, wit, and strategy, no one can mess with my nimble anatomy
Smoke no pot, throat no shots, live in a glass house, but I throw no rocks
Open-minded, but I know what right is, I stand out from the crowd like a photobomb
But the way the game's played, the greats seem rather arbitrary so the standards vary so...
This is how we'll know
Eenie meenie miney mo, who here has the tightest flow?
If you holler at me, bro, I'll be sure to remind you how...
[Hook]
And for those of ya'll who don't know what it means to be dope
I can spell it out, so can I have your attention now to the best in town?

"Mr. Yayo, you're free to go
So I guess this means I'll see you tomorrow, eh?"
{*laughs*}
[Intro: Eminem] + (Tony Yayo)
{*Eminem laughs*}
Yeah! Haha, guess who's home?!
Tony Yayo! Yeah! Obie Trice c'mon!
(Here we go now!)
[Hook: Eminem]
I'm a drama setter,
 grippin my Berretta,
 sippin' Amaretto
Man you crazy if you think I'mma let up, I told you I'm a drama setter
I'll be the first to set it, homie, you can bet it
Just don't get in the way of my cheddar, man cause I'm a drama setter
I don't go looking for no trouble
But somehow the trouble always finds me, don't make me have you
In the trauma center with your momma crying cause her only son is dying
She don't know it's just your karma catchin up cause I'm a drama setter
[Tony Yayo]
I'll poke you man, I'm Rikers Island Pokemon
I got COs bringing me filet mignon
But now a nigga home lookin frail in the drop (what up)
With a bitch shotgun that's inhaling the cock
I got rocks on my neck the size of bottle tops
And got Glocks
 in the Lex
 so we ride behind cops
 (break it down now)
Broke days, we used to put water in our cereal
Now we're crossing borders just to shoot another video
It's Tony Montana on full body armor
Soning niggas like Alfredo in The Godfather
Two shot revolver, that Dillinger shit
And the AR-15 bending your six
We taking trips to Morocco just to tan
We smoke weed in restaurants in Amsterdam
I was worth a hundred grams, now I'm worth a cool million
I'll put money on your hairline, your dime and your children
[Hook]
[Obie Trice]
Since Yayo is home
, them A-Rs is drawn
Obie's Guerilla-Unit, fuck affiliation
We are one, it is senseless for you to prevent this
The 40 cal'll put you up under some photosynthesis
At any given instant (gunshot) another incident
You just got a glimpse of Obie and Yay's temperment
And we holding them K's, that's why homie won't age
Isn't it that Tony's enraged, they thow him in cages
But now my nigga's loose, our crews is bulletproof
All brought to you from 
whom's pupils' baby blues
His short fuses put your portrait on the news
Nigga, them screws is loose when you fuckin with them Shady dudes
[Hook]
[Tony Yayo]
I got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here
And yall rappers only bust shots only in fear
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the Mac
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back
Listen homie, don't let them niggas amp you money
Cause I got niggas in Queens that kill for Pamper money
Move like kaiser, 
Jayson Williams slaughter the driver
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack
What you know about light planes and heavy coke
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats
It's the rap tycoon, Tony yall all know me
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in
For three hots and one cot doing time in the pen
[Hook]

[Intro]
"What am I, a mirage?"
"What?"
"What? Where's my fucking drink? I asked you for a drink."
"You wanted a drink?"
"I just asked you for a fuckin' drink."
"No, I thought, I thought you said that you were alright, Spider,"
"No no no no no no no no. What do you got me on, a fuckin' pay-no-mind list, kid?"
"To attack without knowing the enemy's strength is foolish. After being warned, to still attack is stupid. People who are that stupid just don't deserve to live. But strangely though, one does find people who are that stupid."

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo I'm two-faced, and bugged the fuck out like Mr. Furley
So when I swing a fist of fury y'all can kiss the jewelry
Scrap, back the fuck up, we missed the brewery
Hurry, I'm tryin to pick up Cage's sister early (It's 8 o'clock)
Me and Greed smoke weed and OD
We're so keyed there's no need to stop the nosebleed
I need a casket, I killed some conceited bastard
And beat his ass with a bat wrapped in a sheet of acid
I'm pre-disaster, I fuck shit up before it happens
Like blowing engines of airplanes with snorin' captains
Your style's monotonous, like a borin' job gets
I come to the battle and beat you with foreign objects
I'm dumber than Oklahoma ignorin' bomb threats
I'm dumber than trying to start a war with 'nam vets
My metaphors are like a set of jaws
I get applause, cause people would rather hear mine instead of yours
Still on the run from stabbing a bitch in the side
So I'm hitchin' this ride with the motherfuckin' Indiginous Tribe

Livin' like a sleuth

[Hook]
But don't chew with your mouth full
Don't chew with your mouth full
Cause if you chew with your mouth full
You'll end up biting your toes
[Verse 2]
...
Tossin' curves that are nerve-wrackin'
[Irv?] slackin' I'm throwin' pitches uh switches
Which is trickery, 
victory's repetitious
Though weaker ones and overeager ones that just get ate up
Though many will often try to duplicate the style I made up
If my weight up it wouldn't matter, you're slow as a paraplegic
Whoops you missed, here's my fist, eat it

[Eminem] Obie yo
[Obie] I'm sick
[Eminem]
 
Damn, you straight dog?
[Hook]
That's why I ain't got no time
For these games and stupid tricks
All these bitches on my dick
That's how dudes be getting sick
That's how dicks be getting drips
Falling victims to this shit
From these bitches on our dicks
Fucking chickens with no ribs
That's why I ain't got no time
[Verse 1: Obie]
Yo, I woke up, 
fucked up off the liquor I drunk
I hadda bag of the skunk
, one and last night's tunk
Pussy residue was on my penis
, Denise, from the cleaners
Fucked me good, you should've seen us
Big booty bitch
, 
switch unbearable
French role styling, body like a stallion
Sizing up the figure, while my shit gettin' bigger
Debating on to fuck her, do I wanna be her nigga
Caressing this bitch, plus I'm checking out them tits
Sipping on that fine shit, I ain't use to buying
I gotta hit it from behind, it's mandatory
Like taking ho's money, but that's another story
For surely your pussy on toast, after we toast
Our clothes fell like Bishop in juice
The womb beater, clean pussy eater
, 
inserting my jock
In that spot hotter than the hottest block, don't stop
Response I got when I was knocking it
Clocks steading ticking, kinky finger licking
And carrying on,
 semen at my tip when she moans
I gotta slow down before I cum soon
And work that nigga, like a slave owner
When I dropped off my outfit, she knew I wanted to bone her
She foaming at the lips, the ones between the hips
Pubic hair's looking like some sour cream dip
Without the nacho, my dick hit the spot though
Pussy tighter than conditions of us black folks
We in the final stretch, the last part of sex
I bust a fat ass nut then I woke up next
Like, what the fuck is going on here?
This bitch evaporated, pussy and all just picked up and vacated
And now I'm frustrated cause my dick was unprotected
And doctor Wesley telling me I really got that shit, fuck
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now I don't wanna hit no women but
 
this chicks got it coming
Someone better get this bitch 
before she gets kicked in the stomach
And she's pregnant, but she's egging me on
, 
begging me to throw her
Off the steps on this porch,
 my only weapon is force
And I don't wanna resort to violence of any sort
But whys she shoving me for doesn't she love me no more?
Wasn't she hugging me four minutes ago at the door?
Man I'm this close to going 
toe to toe
 
with this whore
What would you do if she was telling you she wants a divorce
She's having another baby in a month and it's yours
And you found it isn't cause this bitch has been visiting
Someone else and sucking his dick
 and 
kissing you on the lips
When you get back to Michigan
, now the plot has thickened 'n worse
Cause you feel like you've been sticking your fucking dick in a hearse
So you're paranoid at every little cold that you get
Ever since they sold you this shit, you've been holding your dick
So you go to the clinic, sweating every minute you're in it
Then the doctor comes out 
lo
oking like 
Dennis the Menace
And it's obvious to everyone in the lobby, it's AIDS
He ain't even gotta to call in you the office to say it
So you jet back home,
 
cause you gone get that ho
When you see her, you're gonna bend her fucking neck back yo
Cause you love her
, 
you never would've expect that blow
Obie told you the scoop
, how could she stoop that low?
Jesus, I don't believe this bitch works at the cleaner's
Bringing me home diseases swinging from Obie's penis
She's so deceiving, shit this ho's a genius, she geed us
[Hook]
I'm busy, yeah, fuck these bitches
Fuck em all, get money
Ha, 
Shady Records
Wow, Obie Trice
Eminem mother fucker
New millennium shit,
 yeah
Turn this shit off, turn this shit the fuck off

What I wanna do, let me see right here, yo
Not many people that I label
Would be able to display table
Manners
 but my plan this
To make this beat rock like scanners
And make the fans just go bananas
Yo, get our Planters
That means our nuts for the sluts who don't understand this
Yo, my clan is
Yeah right, and y'all gon' stand there
And act like you don't understand it
Like my name is Janet, my titty fell out and I ain't plan it
Check, check this out
And if you're rockin' with your necklace out
That's my breakfast now
I'mma snatch it, yo my style is rechid, you can't fetch it
No you can't stretch it
And yo, it doesn't really matter
Cause your name I can't even pronunciate
You're the sa-same type-a mo'fucker
To go and suckerpunch Dre at the Vibe Awards
But he right behind the boards the next day
So, kiss an ass
Or kiss a dick, lick a dick
Eat my ass
Whatever you wan' do, it's on you
Big Proof comin' through..

[Intro]
Yeah boy, them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
Oh my God, fucking bumbaclot,
 
I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in the Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire,
 
you're nothin' but a brah,
 
boy
I'm the real deal
 
and charbroiler on the bonfire
And 
bon voyage
, bitch I'm like 
Chef Boyardee
In this bitch, 
send a bomb to
 
my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy you think you're Tom Sawyer
Til I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on you
Fuckin' fictional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourselves for Captain America on ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction, it's fact boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly-by-the-seat-of-his-pants para-sail
Or hit the trampoline, bounce, and grap a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch, zip, zero, nothin', no, nada
Like your father fucking your mother
[Hook]
(Drop the bomb on 'em)
Please don't drop the bomb on me, Shady
Shady, please don't drop the bomb on me
(Drop the bomb on 'em)
I don't want no 
dog-gone
 beef, see
Ain't no reason to 
sick the dogs
 on me
[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the real McCoy, you little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids kill the noise, here come the killjoys
Me and Dre, the steel alloys, the rap crown royals
That scalp cowboys, now how that sound for you?
Yeah, boy, you know we're 'bout to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off and before you have a sound voyage
Sayonara,
 see you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R and marinate in some marinara
And have a coke and a smile, 
don't make me open a jar of
Whip-ass on you, that's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most, boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy boy, them boys, them no up to par
I just show up, go up to the stage and blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do, boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy, I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch, I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy, fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God boy, you didn't go there, boy, you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you, boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy,
 
Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin' ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot, when the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop, and when it does, boy, there's a problem
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself, boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell, boy, 
my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell, boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringin' hell, boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on
 
them sedative meds who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy in a black and red little sweater
Back better than ever,
 
the cheddar shredder
The grater,
 
the beef grinder, I'll settle vendettas a little later
Givin' haters incubators,
 think you made a mistake
By sayin' Shady was ghost,
 
I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave,
 
just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place to Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit?
 
couldn't agree
With you more if you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady fucking Aftermath,
 
boy, the ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, 
but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Trying to get in where I fit in; no room for a nigga
But, soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
Cause, all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker
[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head
Bitch, I pick the world up and I'mma drop it on your fucking head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone
Motherfucker, I'm gone
[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive
, 
murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy, I put my burdens aside
[Hook]
[Bridge: Eminem]
I'm gone, I'm gone
It hurts but I never show this pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall
When push come to shove, I just stand up and scream "fuck em all"
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in, this roof is cavin' in
Up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes.
 
Got em cooking, boy
This crooked mind of mines got em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fucking clock, I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'mma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words so your fucking heads better nod
Or I'mma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole,
 
my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk; you're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast
Your fuckin' head'll spin, dogg
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, ill fuckin'
[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah, haha, whoo, shit
(Aight, guess what?
I ain't coming in yet, I'll come in a minute
Ayo, this is my love song,
 it goes like this)
[Verse 1]
Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark (fucking faggot)
This is how we used to make the party start
We used to
 
mix Hen with Bacardi Dark
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk
And by the, 
sixth gin
 
you're gon' probably crawl
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf
And my 
pre-diction
 is 
you're gon' probably fall
Either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall
And every-thing's spinnin',
 
you're beginnin' to think women
Are swimmin' in pink linen
 
again in the sink
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches
You have the right to remain violent
 
and start wilin'
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein' you
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin'
Over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up
(Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot
Looking for life on this planet sir, no sign of it
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin'
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it
Let me outta this place, I'm outta place
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow
I'll be back in an hour or so)
[Hook]
Cause every time I go to try to leave
Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve
I don't wanna, but I gotta stay
These drugs really got a hold of me
Cause every time I try to tell 'em "no"
They won't let me ever let 'em go
I'm a sucker all I gotta say
These drugs really got a hold of me
[Verse 2]
In third grade, all I used to do
Was 
sniff glue
 
through a tube
 and play 
Rubik's Cube
Seventeen years later I'm as Rude as Jude
Schemin' on the first chick with the hugest boobs
I've got no game, and every face looks the same
They've got no name,
 
so I don't need game to play
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want
However, I do show some respect to few
This ecstasy's, got me standin' next to you
Getting sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too
Wake up in the mornin' like "Yo, what the fuck we do?"
I gotta go bitch, you know I have stuff to do
Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you
But in the long run, these drugs are probably going
To catch up sooner or later
 
but fuck it, I'm on one
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord
So it's not a straight line no more
'til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls
Shit's stickin' outta our backs like a dinosaur
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more
So bye for now, I'm goin' to try to find some more
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow
When you swallow it all wallow and drown in your sorrow
And tomorrow you're probably gonna wanna do it again
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again
It's your life, live it however you wanna
Mar-a-ju-on-na is everywhere, where was you brought up?
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin'
Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin'
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin'
Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every mornin'
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded
And graduated to better drugs and updated
But I still got a lotta growin' up to do
I still got a whole lotta throwin' up to spew
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40
Before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin' stories
With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap
Babysitting for Hailie while Hailie's out gettin' smashed
[Hook]

[Dr. West]
"Morning, Marshall."
[Eminem]
"Morning, doc."
[Dr. West]
"So we're discharging you today, how are you feeling?"
[Eminem]
"Anxious."
[Dr. West]
"Anxiety?"
[Eminem]
"Well, anxious to get home, anxious to get back into the world.
 
Nervous.
"
[Dr. West]
"Nervous? C'mon, Marshall, you're a big boy now. Sounding like a bit of a baby, you can do this. 
You found a sponsor yet?"
[Eminem]
"Um, not yet. I mean, but when I get back"
[Dr. West]
"Well, if you find one, you find one. If you don't, you don't."
[Eminem]
"Well, yeah, I mean I gotta start going to meetings first and... 
Wait, what?"
[Dr. West]
"Well, you don't absolutely have to go to meetings and it's not like like a requirement that they fit into your shedule, we know you're a busy person."
[Eminem]
"But I thought sobriety was the most important thing?"
[Dr. West]
"So what else are you thinking?"
[Eminem]
"Um, well, I know I gotta start practising the steps, and I mean learning them, and start being able to apply them."
[Dr. West]
"Steps?"
[Eminem]
"Yeah, steps."
[Dr. West]
"There's a lot of them, aren't there?
[Eminem]
"Well
, 
twelve."
[Dr. West]
"Christ, I don't even know them all."
[Eminem]
"Really?"
[Dr. West]
"Anything else?"
[Eminem]
"Um, well, I mean the only other question I have was like, what do I do if I find myself in a situation where maybe somebody is drinking around me or something like that and I get tempted to—"
[Dr. West]
"Take a drink."
[Eminem]
"What?"
[Dr. West]
"Take a drink and y'know, take the edge off."
[Eminem]
"Take the edge off? Man, if I ever take a drink I already know what that's gonna lead me to."
[Dr. West]
"What, you mean these?" *shakes pills*
[Eminem]
"Man, what the fuck?!"
[Dr. West/Slim Shady]
"Marshall, what's the matter, darling? Having some doubts are we? Marshall, you can't leave me, you'll never leave me, Marshall. We'll always be together, Marshall. Marshall...? Marshall!?
[Eminem]
"No, no, no, no, NO!"

"Oh shit!"

, oh-oh
[Intro: Eminem]
Yo Tigg, get in the not booth
And spit the truth, to the young youth
[Verse 1: Big Trigger]
Aight, ay, Amex don't leave home without your cards
But this Hip Hop, 
so don't leave home without your bars
And for some of these rap stars, that's just too bad
Cause you can't bring out them bars, that you ain't never had
It's Eminem and Slaughterhouse, yeah you know we the truth
And ohh the game is out of order, since we closed the booth
Yes indeed original, beats the replacement cause
The back room will never be what the basement was
[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
I'm the realest mo'fucker that I know
Wasn't always the case guess the figure had to grow
I do it for the love I don't do it for the dough
But I know these sucker figures will so they keep me on my toes
What's sad is I couldn't tell you what I'm hated for
And them painkillers didn't murder the pain they gave me more
These fans on my head now they say they want the old Joe
I grew up mature y'all can't see that this the old Joe
Want to see me lose every battle of 
No matter what it do to me, no matter my regression
They want to see me fall, want to ruin my regiment from the start
Want to cut the beat off soon as I let em in my heart
I'd be the first to admit it, lost focus for a while
Sendin' unsolicited dick pics to dimwitted thick chicks
Was so high I lost track of my ways
Then I fell in love with a baby and got mad at her age
The way she act and behave, was it an act or a phase
How you trife when I gave you life
You was lacking in wage
You don't want say hi or speak to me
 you makin 200 dollars by weekly
Try to 
 out, bring some reparation
And forget being humble in a state of desperation
Ain't gotta ask what to help with no hesitation
And for me to deal with it I might need some meditation
I love you but its best we stay apart, segregation
And to cope with the feeling I might need some medication
Trust me I don't never want to see that side of Joe
It would kill us all slow, one reason I'm the realest mother-mother I know
[Verse 3: Royce da 5'9]
Its Nickle, riding round in that Maserati four seat
Symbol on the grill looking like Tony Stark's goatee
Best rapper alive and you know me
The most distinguished shooter that's coming up out of the D since Joe D
I take mines at lead point
At the risk of having to shave my garlic clove in a razor inside a fed joint
Hip hop is alive, but the rhymes died
Only fear I have is "world star" being yelled from my blind side
Don't get me wrong it ain't like I ain't never lost a fight
But these days I'm more like a lyrical artiste
I'm outlining everybody in chalk white
The off-beat deceased version of Dr. Narcisse
This ain't blueprint, your idolizing
You tryna jump fast that's foolish of you in my drunk past and handing me my pilot's license
That's plain stupid,
 
your boy's a star
Sitting in that drop top fish bowl and the doors ajar
It's ironic I remember when I couldn't afford a car
And now it's back and forth
The black one or white one I call 'em Macklemore
And Lord Jamar, first we defyin' the odds
We not a group, we more like a circular firing squad
This not a booth, this is our house and we won't stop
We killed the cypher two times already
What you gon' give us an award
But we won't stop for shutting down the 
Now tell ya momma hi, and tell Rihanna we ain't finished yet
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
When we step in that booth, that's when the flame enters
Best spit, make any set trip,
 
yeah its the gang members
Waving that shady flag, navy jag
Matching the yank' fit, with the polo brief showing, due to the lazy sag
I'm in a crazy kind of place
I got this thing right on my waist that'll leave tears on your baby mommas face
So chill
, 
I'm in a crazy kind of place, I got this thing below my waist
That'll leave kids on your baby mommas face
, for real
The flow gets cracked, as it came in capsules
Your cap just started snapping
My starter caps was snapping
When cross color was cracking
And my cane was half full
With the 
 park, hope you rap dudes smart
Don't piss me off like the bathroom mop
You don't want it with me
If I'm throwing hooks at you, that don't mean the chorus for free
So save your jabs its way better
If I start throwing jabs I'm talking Zabs first three round against Mayweather
Yeah I'm a crook from the brook, that mastered how 
(?)
 shook turned 
Broke cook, I'm so dope look
Bring the beat back with no hook just bars
Just a thing of ours that make their pants drop, make em open up their bras
Move g-strings like guitars
, that's nothing, 
that's something light
Like Riesling at the bar
Y-A-O-W-A, if y'all ain't saying Yaowa by now you got nothing to say
This like NWO vs NWA
, 
y'all like the rockers versus the ROC
Full of nothing but Jays
Check the rocks its nothing fugaz'
But don't get stupid my Cooper clique will throw shots for a couple of days
Make it 
 when we out, 
Amityville horror, y'all don't want it with the house
[Verse 5: Crooked I]
Slaughter season, y'all the reason
Real dudes I'm bringing some more in
Like a Polynesian
Sick with the llama squeezing
Bullets flew and the chopper sneezing
Got your body and legs torn, but before you was airborne
You was bob and weaving still getting hit till your nos' is weezing
They set you deep in your coffin sleeping
I'm gone off the deep end, 
I'm a wolf, this industry my 
I'm out here hunting with my 
I'm living like a kingpin
Doing it for my g's in the pen
Dreaming about two-piecing a police chief's chin
You rappers something candy coated, I don't like suckers
I'm Iron Mike, I don't like Busters
You looking for em' fly dudes like Orville and Wilbur
You got the Wright brothers
No bright jeans, no bright colors
I'm the second coming, the one that Pac predicted
Islamic, Gnostic and Christian, the flow so godly you got to listen
I backed you in a dodge a minute
Like MC Eiht in a L.A. hat, these rappers straight tryna dodge a menace
I'm looking at your 
, look like your watching tennis
Brothers dressed like 
 wearing 
Meanwhile Big Poppa was rocking linens
I guess that era's over man, hold on
I'm splitting atoms when the scientific spitting is getting at em'
I give em' different patterns, they didn't fathom, they stealing my styles
Before me you didn't have em'
You rappers made in my image like when God was inventing Adam
Stab em in the abdomen when its crunch time
I truly flip like Mayweather pissed of at a 
Too many punchlines
Family I'm amongst mine
I keep the peace like a monks mind
.357 fade your favorite barber
Leave you in an old bush like an unshaven Barbara
Don't stop what we doing
When you see L.A. your team will be ruined
This game need a new villain, I'm the kind to murder you on vine, 
ooh kill em
'
[Introduction: Big Trigger]
Ladies and gentlemen
Now introducing the man, the myth, the legend
Mister Marshall Mathers AKA (chicka-chicka) Slim Shady
[Verse 6: Eminem]
Ayo can we cut this beat off
I might need to do this acapella, yo
Role model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles of coke products
If she don't swallow
, 
and thump her till the bumper, hit the throttle
While I'm tryna hit the 
, 
I'll freaking take Madonna to McDonalds
Any bitch'll end up horizontal gettin' fondle
I don't cuddle, I don't coddle
Only motto that I follows any thing I drive, whether its a  Navajo or a Tahoe
Its got a ho in it
Nah ho, I don't got no freaking bronco
You looking for a buck, get a horse, fuck Tonto
I got a rusty Hondo with a bondo
And a box of condoms you little blond ho
Fuck me? fuck you too, like I'm at Bonnaroo booing Bono
And I ain't from this planet so nanu, nana, nanu
I'm intolerable, too volatile,
 
screw it I don't got too make honor roll
To be on a roll
I don't know much, what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off, all these knock off me's
,
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think this is part 2 to Recovery
Or Love The Way You Lie part twelve
Or something heart felt, you bout to make a discovery
Like you found Christopher Columbus' compass
Ain't dumbing shit down for you dumb fuckers, so suck it[Intro]
All aboard, okay, next stop, my basement
I'll meet you down there
[Hook]
There once was a saying that I used to say
Back in the day when I met Dre
I used to sit and goof on the phone with, my friend Proof
That if I went gold, I'd go right through the roof
He said what If you went platinum, I'd just laugh at him
That's not happening, that I can't fathom
Eighty something million records worldwide later
I'm living in a house with a fucking elevator
[Verse 1]
Haters getting mad, they done had enough of Shady
You slay me, nothing you say matters enough to touche me
Rappers try to play me, they use Hailie as a ukulele
Woopsa that a fucking daisy
That's a no-no who even she knows dada's fucking crazy
Fucking animal, cookoo, bananas, fucking A, B
Maybe it's because I never had a mother raise me
Fuck around and throw a baby at another baby
You may think it's cause of the way that I was brought up
But it's all caught up to me now, karmas in the waters
Every line I ever said has got me in a corner
You might think it doesn't creep upon ya, but it all does
You wouldn't listen man,
 
I tried to warn ya when you started
Now your brain's all haunted cause of all the shit you thought of
Chainsaw slaughters turn your daughters into sawdust
I never thought it'd come to this, I ought to just be honest but
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Sorry Lance, Mr. Lambert, and Aiken ain't gonna make it
They get so mad, when I call them both
 
fake
It's...
 
All these fucking voices in my head I can't take it
Someone shut that fucking baby up, 'for I shake it
You're standing adjacent to Jason slash Leatherface and
Together makes 'em, a fucking bad combination
I lashed at the doctor in my last operation
Shoved the 
Wiener Schnitzel
 up his ass, hopped away some-
-body please stop the patient, 
get the cops to mace him
Homie, I'm the 
Scheiße,
 pass Doctor Dre some
I can't leave the game, I just can't walk away son
No not-a now, not a chance, not today son
I can't believe I leave for one brief second
And you pussies queef all over the rap game, naked
And use a leaf to wipe up the crap stains, feck it
I just keep saying the same exact saying, check it
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Elevator in my house,
 
I'll smell ya later
I blew the fuck up,
 
a hamster in a microwave
I, think about an escalator now, steps, I hate 'em
Told the neighbor step away, then I just pepper sprayed 'em
Yeah, for every time you ride down the street
Or hideout, drive by my house and beep
Like now mothafucka, try now to sleep
Lie down fucker, try counting sheep
And you're tryna find out, why now there's beef?
Mace in your face bitch, cry now pussy
This is my house, all nine thousand feet
So you can suck my dick with Amy Winehouse's teeth
Then I shove 'em in the elevator, take 'em to the top
Stand above em, just to cut the fucking cable, let 'em drop
Walk an hour to the damn refrigerator, get a pop
While I let 'em fall all the way to the basement yelling stop!
[Hook]
[Outro]
Fucking son of a bitch, I can't believe this shit
This must be all that there is, this must be it
Fucking A, even got a 
bidet
Wash my ass after I shit with gold toilet paper
Dishwasher's so big, when I'm pissed off
I can just toss a flying saucer in it
This shit's awesome, yeah, fucking elevator
Living in a house with a fucking elevator


I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach
That punctured a lung punk and I'm still functioning from it
Chump it was nothing
Now watch while I fuckin' one up it and toot my own horn
Once I think of something to trump it
And I don't need a fucking instrument to sound off
Like the trunk of an elephant. 
The triumphant
Return of the ether spitting retard, reborn
But chances of you having another re-birth
, 
slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Teresa
, 
give a fuck if its Easter
, 
so kiss my keister
Cus that's the only thing I'll turn the other cheek for

Ayo, Paul. It's Em, I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "thrilled" about the video
What, does he wanna be startin' somethin'?
Wowa, well I'll show him who's really bad
*Burps*
Paul the way you make me feel with these calls
You should really take a look at the man in the mirror and tell him to beat it because I won't stop till I get enough
Do you remember the time
 we were watching the 
Billie Jean video
Well he'll always be that Michael to me
 
and it doesn't matter if he's black or white
 
cause I can't stop loving him
 and 
I hate plastic surgeons and I hope they all fucking die
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I wanna touch him... but I can't
*Mouth noises*
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit
Sorry, anyways call me back
I have this idea on how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message, fucker
Oh, and by the way, no I don't have a new gun
Goddamn it

All she wrote

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Peace to Thirstin Howl,
 
A.L.
 and 
Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerd cursed, 
with badly disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, starting with your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch
With smeared letters, running together in blurred spurts
I hang with male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's
My first words were bleep-bleep and curse-curse
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs
Yanking out my stitches, hollering, nurse nurse
You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps
And it's like that, and it's like that
[Verse 2: Evidence]
Got no apathy
Yo, I platform my strategy, mix words in alchemy
Evidence, I won't get caught shot on the balcony
Between you and I, I'll tell you here's the diff
Gun to your head, you're dead, pointblank I shapeshift
That's right to dear, anelope, or owl
In life, use your potential, or Steve Howe
I'm about to call it quits, yo too much weight'll break your rack mount
The man'll make you move, yo so make your move a backout
You say I use my name too much as a clutch
Try holding on to beat instead of pushing on your crutch
Flipped it backwards, Evidence attack nerds off the head
Steadfast, right or left, don't matter see you coming
Deaf/Def like Leppards, pop the piece, I be the sheppard
Causing the herd, the name is Ev absurd
Verbs get flipped, it's like this, yo acronyms and all that
Methaphor imagery, you claiming metaphors and spitting similies
Not having it, the name is Evidence
Like Pos. K gibbin the life thinking of stabbing it
Skills prevail you possess, take no offense
But don't profess lies within your mind, tempt and stress
[Iriscience]
It's like uh-oh-oh
It's Dilated Peoples on the Wake Up Show-uh-oh
We kick a lick or some for the radio-uh-oh
Yo CaTashTrophic like Rico

I'll shove a gun in ya grill
Greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard so when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated
While you breathing or you'll be leaving
The receiving room this evening with Jesus
You hate on us, we'll be waiting on eight corners
Swarming your hood with a thousand angry skateboarders
I'll hop in the Jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that ya mom bought you
Mess around and get choked and found in a moat
Floating around drowned face down in a boat
I'll pile five dudes in a pen
And we'll pull up to the seven mile drive-thru
At McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a driver out his Eddie Bauer
When it rides by me at ninety miler per hour
This place is my house, 
I might as well erase my face with white-out
Cause y'all can't see me like 
Mase's eyebrows
It's like that, it's like that

[Eminem]
If I'm elected for ten terms
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural
And hiring all girls as interns
If I don't like you, 
I'll snatch you outta your mic booth
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you
I'll take you straight to the pavement
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet
Like a razor that shaved it
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash
Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my ass (Look!)
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl
(Hop in the car little girl, I just bought you a doll)
The Bad and Evil movement is comin
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach
I write a rhyme a day
So it's no wonder how come your whole album
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say
Whether it's one verse or one letter
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love

[Verse 1]
It's the mothafuckin' Farm Club
This little girl 'bout to get a arm rub
Who wanna see me on this mothafuckin' fiction board
Who wanna see me on a mothafuckin' diction lore
And I'll be kicking source to mothafuckin' camera looking right in it
I can kick twenty dope rhymes in one minute
And y'all don't understand cause my rhymes are Infinite
[Refrain]
What's the Farm Club?
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club
It's the mothafuckin' *chika-chika* Farm Club
[Verse 2]
Is this shit there wasn't be bleeped out?
I don't know but I feel it is and it's like *eeh-eh*
And I will kicking rhyme until it stops to *eeh-eh*
[Outro]
What? Wha-what? It's the Farm Club?
What? Wha-what? Wha-what? It's the Farm Club?

[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs 
but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down,
 
the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how
Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality
Oh - there goes gravity
Oh - 
there goes Rabbit,
 he choked
He's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again
 yo this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Hook x2]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
[Verse 2]
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada.
 And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum da-dah
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
No more games
, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning
, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers,
 
and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer
, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father
 and 
a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot
, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point
, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
[Hook]

It's like that (Uh, Eminem...Eminem)
Alright bust it (What)
[Eminem]
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Gotcha locked in a cellar with your skeleton showin'
Developin' anorexia- while I'm standing next to ya
Eatin' a four-course meal watching you starve to death
Put a IV in ya vein feeding you liquid Darvaset
Pumpin' you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on a gunshot victim full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up by an ambulance and driven to receiving
With they asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than twenty percent chance of living
Havin' a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's lil' basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy
On you while you scream "I'm still alive!"
Drivin' a rusty scalpel through the top of ya scalp
I'm pullin' ya Adam's apple out through ya mouth
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arsonist
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment
[* Laughter *]

[Kon Artis]
What is it my thang size or the way that I talk
Is it the clothes that I wear or the way that I walk
That's making you stare at me with this glare
That let's me know that you're unaware
About this Glock in my underwear
It's just another day in the life
Of me making a widow out of a wife
With a happy life
Yup, better up walk it away player
These hay-makers don't last longer than an energizer pacemaker
[Proof]
Ay-yo my name is big Proof
You know me, holla at a fast freak
That's got 
R-Kelly's
 name tated on their ass 
cheek
I blast heat at your feminine flow
And watch your chest leak in the street like the 
"Eminem Show
"
What are you trying to blow guns that we've got
We're from the "
D-Town
"
We're bound
You shoot we get the rebound
???? Squad
If Will Smith is Ali
Then Proof is God
[Eminem]
Yo, honestly I don't even know if I can come after that
(Background "Yes he can")
Ay-yo 
In my mind I'm a fighter
My heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid
My flow sparks it right up
But arsenic writer
Author with arthritis, carpal tunnel
Marshall will start shit-itis
Hard-headed and hot-headed
Bull-headed and pig-headed
Dick-headed a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick-witted for every lyric spitted
There are 6 critics who wait for me to slip wit' it
So quick, this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna explode any minute
Some lunatic lit it
And it's not Nelly
Do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I quit so stop dwelling
I am not failing you fuckers are not ready
Cause I got jelly
, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is destiny
, 
yes money
I'm off running so get off of me
I am not slowing or softening
"No Apologies"
I ?? on this ??
(Background "Put the mic down, the cords too hot")

[Hook: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 1]
Dear Slim,
 
I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man,
 
how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too,
 
that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
, 
this is Stan
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote; I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said no
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my Mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it ?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning dog, come on, how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad
Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you, damn

[Eminem]
Dude tell 'em I'm getting a massage dude.   

[50 Cent]
Shady, Aftermath
G-G-G-G, G-Unit!
[Hook: Eminem & 50 Cent]
Cause we came here to set this party off right
Let's bounce tonight
And if they don't let us in through the front
We'll come through the side
Cause I don't ever wanna leave the game without
At least saying goodbye
So all my people on the left, all my people on the right
Scream one last time
[Eminem]
Get your ass up for the doctor, one more time
Get your ass up for the doctor,
 come on now
Here we go, cliff hanger, 
it's another club banger
Got you hanging on the edge of your seat, get on down
[Dr. Dre]
Times up, game's over, you lose, I win
Bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here
Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin
Look who's got you going crazy again
I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in
I go out and just come back full circle again
You a fad, that means your something that we already had
But once you're gone, you don't come back
, too bad
[Eminem]
You're off the map now, radar can't even find you
We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you
You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you
We walk around just playing the violin behind you
Enough with all the pissing and moaning, whining and bitching
Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention
Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three
 
diamond
Worldwide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbing
[Hook]
[Eminem]
When Dr. Dre say crunk, you will get it crunk
(Get it crunk, crunk, crunk, crunk)
And when 50 Cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump)
[Dr. Dre]
The buzz is tremendous,
 we drop you all to sense it
I don't gotta promote it for you to know that Doc is off the benches
(We keep the party rocking off the hinges
We ain't showing off, we just going off popular consensus)
But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk
Doc is all washed up, knock it off, who the fuck is Doc impressing?
Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression
You must be on the cock of Doc, cause Doc left you all guessing
So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (What?)
We gon' have this mutherfucker hopping in a second (Bump bump)
That's why we always save the best cut last
To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass
[Eminem]
Cause we done swam with the sharks, wrestled with alligators
Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers
Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap, maybe raised to be racist
Who may have never got to see our faces
Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages,
 
broke down barriers
Of language and races,
 
just call on the caped crusaders
And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic and we can play the, back
And forth all day like the hot potato game, that's why we came to
[Hook]
[Eminem]
50 Cent, come on!
[50 Cent]
Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do
We make the club jump everywhere we go
It's no secret, everybody know
When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved
[Dr. Dre]
And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sundays
And palm trees Cali, everyday it's just another party
From the valley's,
 
all the way to them 8 Mile alleys
(
Let's rally, hands up for the grand finale
Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak
Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week
)
You could catch me in the studio banging out the beats to
Provide you with the heat that keep blazing out your speaker
[Eminem]
So never say never cause Shady/Aftermath together
Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the.. the Doc (and Shady)
No one could do it better, we tear the club up
And leave without a shred of evidence and uh
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
Yeah, still 
Aftermath,
 
2006
And don't worry 'bout that Detox album
It's coming, we gon' make Dre do it
HAHA!
50 Cent, G-Unit, Obie Trice, D-Twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre
We ain't leaving, let's go!
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for coming out, peace!
Oh shit, I almost forgot, you're coming with me..
Bye bye! (See you in hell, fuckers)

Regular Cover:

Collectors Edition Cover:

Brent Musberger: We welcome you back to Ann Arbor, Michigan and what a pleasure for Herbie and me to introduce Marshall Mathers. Some of you may know him as Eminem, but he's gonna join the Saturday night crew with our music intro starting next Saturday Night.
But folks, I wanna take you to 
the World Premiere of one of his new videos, called Berzerk. Take a listen, it's headed to the top of the charts.
[Berzerk video plays]
BM: Was that Rick Rubin who was helping produce that, with you Marshall, when you did that?
Eminem: Yeah, sorry. Live TV. Live TV freaks me out a little bit.
Kirk Herbstreit (KH)
: No!?
Eminem: Umm...yes. I'm sorry, what was the question?
BM: That was Mr. Rubin, one of the all-time greats...producer, huh?
Eminem: Yes, yes.
BM: How long does that take you to shoot a video like that? How many takes? How many hours?
Eminem: Umm...sometimes it's uh...it's usually a two day process, sometimes it could go to three. There's a lot of takes, there's a lot of sticking around waiting...But...it's cool [Herbstreit tries to interject] if the video comes out, then i guess it's worth it. You know.
KH: You wanna take it to break?
BM: Yeah...we'll take....you know...you gotta be in shape too, but stay right here with us, we're gonna kick off the 2nd half and I wanna talk about how you're gonna intro Saturday Night Football when we come back.
[commercial break]
BM: 8 EST on ABC, 
Marshall Mathers
 will open Saturday Night Football. Mathers, it's a pleasure to have you on the show.
Eminem: Absolutely, pleasure to be here. It's an honor to be able to do that. So..
KH: So you have the single out...album's coming out in November. What are you most excited about with this no album?
Eminem: 
Nothing
.
KH: No?
Eminem: No...uhh...it'll be out Nov 5th. I'll probably be most excited to just be done with it. It's called 
the Marshall Mathers LP2
. And..it's kind of a re-visit to the first 
Marshall Mathers LP
...and umm...that's pretty much all i can say about it.
BM: One final question before you leave. Some of my friends in Montana wanted me to ask you. 
Will the Lions cover 4.5 tomorrow against Minnesota?
Eminem: Will the Lions cover 4.5?
BM: Yeah.
Eminem: Ummm...I'm not sure man...I don't ever make a prediction on the Lions cause I don't ever wanna jinx it, but I'm such a die hard Lions fan, like...to the core. So...yes, they'll win.
KH: That's all you'll say, leave it at that.
Eminem: Yeah...I'm hoping I didn't just jinx it.
BM: Here's the kickoff Marshall
...just stick right here with us now. It's gonna be Wolverines ball. They've got the lead...out to the 25 yard line.
Marshall
, again, it was a pleasure having you with us here tonight.
Eminem: And Brent, just how they got fantasy football or whatever. I got you on my fantasy announcer team. It would be you, of course the late great 
Pat Summerall and John Madden and Al Michaels.
 If you guys would get together and just call the game....Kirk, you're great too, much respect.
[All laugh]
KH: Not quite to that status yet, I get it!
Eminem: Right. But, you being a legend and you know, if you got with Al Michaels man and John Madden and just called ONE Lions game. The Super Bowl probably would be great this year.
KH: We'd all appreciate that wouldn't we?
Eminem: Man, that would be like a dream come true for me. You are a legend my friend. Thank you.
BM: YOU're the legend my friend! 
13 Grammys,
 
1st rap song to win an Academy Award, an original score
...
Youve sold 100 million records world wide.
 YOU my friend are the legend.
KH: No doubt about that!
Eminem: I'm really uncomfortable right now.
[All laugh]
BM: Marshall, take care my friend. 
We look forward to seeing that video next week.
Eminem: Absolutely, Thank you, thank you...

[verse 1: Eminem]
"Lights, action, cameras flashin'
Managers, sponsors, concerts, monster mashin'
Flashin type of mic
That was unaware of trash like marilyn manson
Updated axle rose
White version of shaft pimp slappin' hoes
Pull up like a mac
Jat black limo strecth so far back you can't see
The back windows. steppin out pink hats, furs, and minks chicks on each arm
What the fuck you think right arm go that kid from 
nsyncs
 chick on it
Left arm got that little pink chick on it
Me and dre at the vma's again
 
pissin' off all theses lesbians and gays again
[ verse 2: Proof]
"let me show you what the clip does
Cause d12 are harder than virgins inside strip clubs
Yo, we bust thugs
You beatin us is like 20 inch doves on glove buzz
It won't happen don't take the satisfaction
With funk flex you got your back spittin'
Actin' like you harder than life
Peace to obie trice
Rock a mic is on the right
Obie trice has been around the globe twice
How it feel with the shine show was
Peace to Mark Labelle, Flex and Paul Rosenburg
Yo M. Diddy save me ayo, 
i think my dads crazy

[Hook]
Come on hit me with your best ..
Come on hit me with your best ..
Hit Me With Your Best Shot, Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Hit Me With Your Best Shot, Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Hit Me With Your Best Shot, Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Come on hit me with my best
Come on hit me with my best
Come on hit me with my best
[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Proof died, what happened (happened)? Marshall stopped rappin'
I guess that makes me the captain, hit the matress, pistol packin'
Sick assassin, bitch to gassin', get to mashin'
D-12 broke up, were you bitches askin'
Our clique relaxin' in the hills of Aspen, poppin' pills and Aspirin
And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life
Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
So I figured that I would grab the mic
Like a nigga 'bout to rhyme right after Christ
Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight
Grab an oath in the afterlife, that's only right
Living like a rock star is the only life
And we are, 
6 grown men, who are old friends
My nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton
All the way down, I'mma hold them, 
D-12 nigga, 'till the world end
[Hook:]
Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Hit Me With Your Best Shot
Come on hit me with my best
Come on hit me with my best
Come on hit me with my best
[Verse 2: Swifty]
A lotta niggas try to underestimate me
'till I come back with vengeance and slice their trachea
Y'all been placed on a contract for hatin'
I'mma waste 'em, one by one, for taintin'
Ability to kill a facility, I'm a sinner of Satan
Fast as a child rapist facin'
Life or trifle, Henny has made me in waitin'
They gon' lock me up under the basement
I'm a one man army, marine and navy
You done made me angry
I'm crazy, insane, and maybe
I bite the face off your baby
For anyone who try to diss
 
Proof
 or 
Hailie
I'mma break their Halo
Put 'em on the reaper's payroll, erase them and hang their soul
It ain't no hoes here, 
McVay's
 
got a scroll
With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold
[Hook:]
[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I know you thought we were done, we rose up
Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up
And hit us with the best shot and we're still standin'
So tell the world it can lick our scrotum
Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt
Who wanna be the fall guy, who want the punt
Who wanna get fucked for lookin' at me sideways
Every time I roll up I'mma keep it blunt
Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall
Y'all did it big like Costco
And we back in this bitch like a tampon
Still fuck dirty, Em's clean like a bar o' soap
And you were so slick, on some baffoon shit
My hand's on a sweeper, your was on a broomstick
Stop lookin' all stupid, I'm rude and abusive
And strapped, don't make me use it
[Hook:]
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Aight, here's where I come in at...
I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin
So you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
Step right in this mark with my henchmen and
Walk, straight to the stage
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
Fall back, little cocksucker, 
I ain't A&W
Don't get your cold mugs in my way
Get 'em? Shattered, fuckin' A
Been this way since B.C.
, what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
Don't get turned to a vegetable dick face
You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D-12 spittin' flames
 
like flamethrowers
Spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors
That cut with the same force as chainsaws
Hope you're coming with your A game
Cause things have changed in this game, isn't the same game, boys
The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us
[Hook:]

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Why is everything I love the most, so wrong for me?
And everything I’m holding close, is so far away from me?
They don’t want me to lie but, they don't wanna' hear the truth
It never made sense to me
Why everything I love the most, is so wrong for me!
[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah! Problematic, I’m so problematic
That I’m probably a problem addict
Pop an aspirin cause my head is hurtin'
Hotel bedroom, missin' curtains
Sheets everywhere like a storm has passed
In fact it looks like I got into a wrestlin' match
Empty bottle of Jack, I could tell I did that
I could smell it in fact, it's like death and ass
Think for a minute if I look over and look
To my left is an opened book, a Bible
To my right is a guilty conscience
 and her name is Brooke, my rival
At least I think her name was Brook
She’s asleep, and I’m givin' her the lamest look
Move her hair back so that I could see your face
Cause it was dark and I met her at the game it took
About 5 minutes to get her inside the whip
Another 5 minutes to get up inside the lips
Never try really man, I really tried to slip, out
But it was just thighs and hips
OK, I was high, shit
On alchohol and the Yelawolf ego trip
Leave her lying in bed cause 
I
 don’t need no kiss
And it’s the walk of shame again!
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Smokin’ hot, throw it up
Keep a fifth off in my cup
Trying not to be a simp
But every time I take a sip
I think I’m gonna fall in lust
I'm back and forth like I'm packing a truck
In a house that never runs out of boxes
Knowing that if I put on my tennis shoes
And a fresh fit, I’ll end up sockless
By the end of the night, flip flopping
I’ll B-Boy if you let me Hip Hop in
Alligator skin cowgirl boots only means let’s get it crockin’
That mini skirt makes any man a flirt
Manicures, animal furs and a purse
What could a little bit of smoke and Henny hurt?
You make any jerk make a penny work
Sinister with sin in her
She can leave a devil sitting in the church
On another level, not in the earth
Jessica Alba had twins at birth
Trippin' sure, piles of E, ménage-a-trois, piles of three
Waking up again, not proud of me
Yeah, I'm a lousy fiend
[Hook]

[Intro: Obie Trice]
Yeah
Ride wit me
Come ride wit Trice, man
I brought my man wit me
Curtis Interscope Jack (ha ha)
Mr. Mathers, my nigga Fif' [Yeah]
Holla at 'em
[Hook: 50 Cent]
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
Everywhere I go, I mean, like everywhere I be
It seems like everybody knows, how I get down, and why B, homie
[1st Verse: Obie Trice]
They say Obie Trice gone, look at em
Back then I was Mike Jones, who would even look at 'em?
Now I recite songs with icons, see I come from convicts and crumbs
My nigga,
 
listen, his transitions shows his ambitions
Nuttin less then the man getting off his ass and vanishing
Into the world of ass kissing, witness him with Ashton Kutcher
Now they ask for pictures, autographs, signatures
Went from rags to riches to getting ass from bitches
It's hard to grasp the situation at hand
When you used to have to ask for digits
Now they pass em to you like easy fast for tickets
Classic isn't it? Coming from a past with a casket
Dips from beneathe the grass, so you're cremated to ashes
Nigga, created from the Craft, this is past fictious
Fif, tell em how we was when we last wen' visit
[Hook]
[2nd verse: Obie Trice]
And now the spotlight's on Trice
But back when the spot life was Trice
I always kept beside a spot for a mic, despite
Wrongs and rights, I would write after I slung white
To homes on the pipe, I had a notion I would be bi-costal
But being across the ocean is la vida loca
And vada loco, I'm in Janayo
Konecheewa in Tokyo, it's sushi with eel
I got a taste for that pompies chopping up in Brazil
Drinking the finest wines in France on the hill
Now how real is he to come from where we get killed
To having all his dreams fulfilled, look out
I got fantasies of being in Italy where the women be
Offering me the cooch-o, eating on ossobuco
Awesome, I know, so often, we just reach the coffin
And never get to see what the world's offering
[Hook]
[Outro]
{50 Cent}
Yeah
Things change man
You know, get a chance to travel
See the world and you start to look at things a lil different
{Obie Trice}
You ain't bullshitting
Cuz I ain't never thought I'd see it out the hood
Heh, look at a nigga now

[Eminem]
Lord, please forgive me for what I do
For I know not what I've done
[Hook: Eminem]
Father, please forgive me for I know not what I do
I just never had the chance to ever meet you
Therefore I did not know that I would grow to be
My mother's evil seed and do these evil deeds
[Verse 1]
Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off
Head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin' dropped off
(gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off, gettin' dropped off)
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch
(their front porch, their front porch, their front porch, their front porch)
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn
(else's lawn, else's lawn, else's lawn)
 
'til somebody finally took me in
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)
They were the ones who were left in charge
My elementary they ganged up on me and sang this song
(sang this song, sang this song, sang this song, sang this song)
It went a little something like
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand
And by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad?
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me
Where does that leave me? Well I guess that I'm between predominantly
Both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin' word again I'mma scream
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?
Do you think that I'm kidding?
 
What do I look like some kind of idi-
Wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?
Why do I go through so much bullshit,
 
it's such bullshit, it's tush mull bisch
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions
And his mansion and his sorrow
 
he's always drownin' in
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad
And how his mom was a dope addict,
 
and his ex-wife how they go at it
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it
I can't imagine it,
 
that little rich poor white bastard
Needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it
Man if I only had half of it
Shit, if you only knew the half of it
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds
Please release me from these demons
I never had any of this shit planned, mom, please believe
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn,
 
never got the chance to say I'm sorry
Now look at all the pain I caused
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin' this year again?
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?
Everything could have been so perfect
But life ain't a fairytale,
 
I'm about to be hoisted up in the air
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere
I don't even know why they feel like they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now,
 
curtains up, the show must go
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on
'til I pass 50 back the baton,
 
the camera's on, my soul is gone
[Hook]
{*gunshot*}
[Eminem] Oh!
{*crowd cheering*}
[Eminem] Last one baby, let's go

[Eminem] Detroit!

[Intro]
Yeah, trying to figure out the difference
But I think the lines are starting to get blurred
[Verse 1]
I'm in a strange place
I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith
I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints
Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space
Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face
I need a change of pace cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous
There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em
Cause that's where most of my anger is baste
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints
I just want to hurt you - aim for the skanks
Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes
I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack
I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped
For battles sucka - duck, crawl out the back
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools
Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also
And I ain't stopping 'til the swear jar's full
"You done called every woman a slut
But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall (Palin)"
Oh, my bad. Slut
And next time I show to in court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit
Judge be like "That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?
Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you
And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker
You're so fucking gravy, Marshall I should start calling you 'au jus'
Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you
I believe people can change, but only for the worse
I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse
So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
Cause they're worse when they're reversed motherfucker
(Rape your mother, kill your parents)
 
[shit, motherfucker]
And these kids are like parrots, they run around the house just like terrorists
Screaming, "fuck, shit, fuck"
 
adult with a childish-like arrogance
Wild ever since the day I came out I was like, merits
Fuck that - I'd rather be loud and I like swearing
From the first album even the gals were like "tight lyrics
Dreamy eyes",
 
but my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and
Opposition felt the opposite,
 
sometimes I listen
And revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches
To make sure I keep up with my competition (ha ha)
Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines
And that sort of defines where I'm at and the way I feel now
Feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies
[Bridge]
There's darkness closing in, there it goes again
It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin
(Then I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
But he's just a friend, who pops up now and again
So don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin
(I step out and see my evil twin, he gives me an evil grin)
[Interlude]
Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend
You have slept for quite some time
[Verse 2]
So who's left,
 
Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither
Simpson or Alba,
 
my albums just sicker than strep with the fever
Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burning to death but I'm freezing
Bed ridden
 
and destined never to leave the
Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh-
Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible read the
Bottom, it's signed by the Joker,
 
Lorena said I never can leave her
She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her
Fuck that shit bitch,
 
Give up my dick for pussy?
I'd be Jerry Mathers, I ever left it to Beaver
Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver
Golly-wally,
 
I vent, heat register, Jesus
Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden,
 
it was definitely my
Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun
At Osborn,
 
I'd never make it to sophomore
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors
Flip burgers and wash dishes, but I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em
Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em
They were sleeping,
 
I made 'em stop snorin'
Made them break out the popcorn
Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form
Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn
Screaming "Fuck the police" like cop porn
Flipped rap on its ear like I dropped corn
Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four
And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore
And I got an Evil Twin
So who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for?
And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him
And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem?
But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin)
(Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again?
Hi! Faggot
Look who's back with a crab up his ass
Like a lobster crawled up there
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs
Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there
Peace to Whitney, jeez just hit me
That I should call the Looney Police to come get me
Cause I'm so sick of being the truth, I wish someone finally admit me
To a mental hospital with Britney
Oh LMFAO,
 
no way, Jo-
Se Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no
Hooray, I'm off the hook like Casey Anthony,
 
(hey ho) Hey-ho!
I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray",
 
no
I’m hollering you got bottom-end like an 8-0-
8 and I 'base' whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so
Let your low end raise, yo
Tango, what you think, ho?
 
Slow dancing or bowling?
You trying to hold hands with your homie?
What, you think I'm looking for romance cause I'm lonely?
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me
Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a bo-ner
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work
So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work
But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed

[Hook: Lazie Boi]
Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only
Trying But Slowly
It Feels Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
No More
[Verse 1: Tyga]
Probably one of my realest loves ever, four page letters
In time it’s all better, ‘cause time heal whatever
I'mma need a moment cause moments last forever
Cars with cream leather, females are on regular
What’s the point in titles, we liking it how they tell us
I’d rather stay friends with benefits 'til we ready
Now ready,
 
Sean Don got me feeling heavy
She like one more chance, more problems, no Biggie, ah
It’s all good, don’t take it the wrong way
Ain’t nothing personal, but who this nigga in your face?
We can leave together or you can take your space
The night young, we should head over to my place
Ha, now we laughing and all that
Tell your friend they can fall back
Ain’t even gotta ask twice
She said what you feeling like?
I'm like...
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
My enemies crack corn but I don't care
You can be black white or albino yeah
You can have cornrows inside your hair
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare
This bottle of wine goes upside your head
A little bit psycho but I know that
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it
See if you don't brag then I don't brag
I know I'm bad as long as I know I'm bad
I don't need ya'll to co-sign no shit
You can just keept making them tired old threats
Little bit like the boy who cried wolf did
See me but don't dare to try no shit
Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass
And I can be so quite and strike so fast
Like lightening bolts right out the sky go blast
[Hook]
[Outro: Lazie Boi]
Cause Baby I'm Lonely
Can Somebody Hold Me
It Feel Like I'm Fallin Now, I Can't Hold My Ground
It Feels Like I'm Only

I don't wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
Farewell miss I know that you can care less
But I'm sorry for everything I was careless
But I need you to know that I love you so much
And I've been drinking myself to sleep
 my souls crushed
A couple more shots I know I'm gonna go nuts
I can't deal with the fact you left me with no crutch
I was in love with you how could you do this to me
Actually I did this to myself, what a tragedy!
And now what do I do?
Where do I go?
Cause everywhere I go I see your face
It's hard starting over
Trying to find another shoulder
To lean on
I feel like my whole life just got peed on
They say time heals but dammit I wanna stop time and feel this pain
As crazy as it sounds to me its sane
And I like it, why? cause I feel like were still united
In some weird way I don't wanna fight it
I don't wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just don't go as wed like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
I wrote you the other day and you didn't write back!
It's like that? After all the crap we been through!?
I can't believe you! I know I fucked up!
But look within you and find some love and stop being stuck up!
You keep sending me to voicemail!
I'm annoyed, hell!, shit you coulda atleast sent a text
But you're probably busy kissing someone else's lips
While I'm sitting here cleaning my shoes from this shit!
You're hard headed a sharp headache
I nee
d help call a medic
I just cut myself, yeah I did it
Without you I'm nothing don't you get it!?
Everytime that I said I loved you I meant it!
You turn and tell me you hate me and regret that
We ever met, I can't believe you just said that
You're so cold you just hit me so low
I can't take this nomo so hit the road
I don't wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight
Some things just don't seem the way they do
One day you tell me I love you and only you
I wake up to find out it was a dream
You're telling you hate me, you're leaving me
People change everything changes
We go from best friends then become strangers
We go from seeing eachother everyday then
Farewell to never seeing your face again
I can't get you outta of my head
So I'm out of bed at 4 in the morning
Wishing I was dead
But for some odd reason I can't do it
For some reason I needed to write
Whats on my mind and whats going through it
Cause if I don't I'll prolly suffocate
Why do you have so much hate
Towards me you need some loving babe
God I fuckin' love you I hate myself
For falling in love with you
Just to find out all I did was trouble you
My heart is aching I'm medicated
I tried meditating
But nothing works I don't even feel sedated
I wish you could feel what I feel for one second
I wreckon you would jump out your window bare naked
Fuck humiliation, you do anything to get me back
Opinions wouldn't matter what they thought in fact
You would tell everyone to fuck themselves good
And do everything to have me if you could
I don't wanna say goodbye
But sometimes things just don't go as we'd like
All I wanna do is cry
Say my farewells pack up and leave tonight

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Obie the person that came up introverted
Cause of nervousness, that was solely the only verdict
It was worth it cause he changed, became so observant
Serving such of a purpose
If you knew him earlier in his days, it's like a different version
So much hurting and pain gave him game for certain
That's why it's curtains in this murder, if you get him worked up
I'm so assertive on these motherfuckers acting tougher
Had enough of isolating myself in a room
Writing poems and songs, doing the same in school
Now look what he became, 
a fool
Cause he learned how to sustain his tool and obtain fame from you
Living hard but still Julliard
A god walks and ain't spend a day in the 
pew
Regardless of this I draw visual
, pictures when a nigga vents
So welcome to the art department
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I stimulate the brain
, 
mimic, emulate the sane
Cynics keep on thinking it's a fucking gimmick when it ain't
Clinically insane
, 
brain is on Venus,
 
up Uranus
Label me a genius
 if you ever seen us you would say
"He may seem as though he's plain normal"
 
if you ever meet him
Greet him with a shake, see he ain't as mean as what they say
See the thing is maybe he can't always think of things to say
So he's vague, so they mistake him for being crazed
You part ways, your impression of him changed
You don't think he's strange, you turn around and tell him "Peace and thanks"
You catch him flipping you off, with his pants down
Hands around his scrotum, tucking his fucking penis between his legs
[Verse 3: Eminem]
It's all psychologic, why am I so maniacal?
Am I a psycho or some kind of psychotic shtick?
Or am I truly psychotic? Or my molecules just diabolical?
Cause biologically, I defy logic
By golly, haul me off on a trolly
Probably want a quack
, 
or I'm back on that
 
whacky tobacca
I'mma step away from crack, 
Obie smacked the shit out of me
I'm so slap happy, man, slap me back to reality
I'm a walking art gallery, a science museum
Elephantitis of the nuts, you'd probably die if you see them
I pull them out, they hit the ground and probably crack the cement
I need an ambulance, I can't just put them back in my pants (Help!)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
First verse, uh,
 
I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's riding on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, or kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him outta his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas's intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claiming you banging
You flaming bet you could light your own
Cigarette with ya asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the 80's
My 90's was like the Navy
You was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily
[Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes
Bumping Ice Ice Baby
Screamin' Shady til I die
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once
So I'm thinking bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, don't stop me now fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this :
Nicki Minaj but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am back
And I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
Cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics
So get this dick, I'mma live this
[Hook: Sly]
Living life in the fast lane
Moving at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line
So I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed
Just enjoying the ride
Just gon' roll til I drop
 and ride 'til I die
I'm living life in the 
fast lane
 (Pedal to the metal)
I'm living life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
[Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says I'll let you take me
You let me take a shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian
Go back and forth and, more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm living the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, chimney now
The semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around,
 
entering in the vicinity
[Eminem]
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up, and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's looking around this club and it looks like people are having a shit-fit now
Yeah, little t-t-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I s-s-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfucking Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9"
 
to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfucking chick underwater, he's trying to d-d-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way
 
that you keep licking them dick-sucking lips, I'm agitated
Aggravated
 
to the point you don't suck my dick, then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fucking give me head, then I'm have to take it
[Royce da 5'9"]
And then after taking that, I'mma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinating
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the
 
affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator
Meaning I'm on fire, off the top,
 
might wanna back up data
Rolling over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
 
These shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader
Homie they spent
[Eminem]
Now make that ass drop like a sack of potatoes
Girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator of this party,
 
be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt,
 
you're rolling with a player
You won't be exaggerating when you say you're living
[Hook]

[People chanting Eminem]
[Paper folding/tearing]
[Footsteps]
[Door open and slam shut]
[More footsteps]
[Eminem]
I almost forgot
You're comin' with me
[Gun reloading]
[Eminem]
That's him baby, let's go
That's him baby, let's go
That's him baby, let's go
[sigh]

[Hook]
In the kitchen (putting work)
On the scale, flip a bird, flip a bird, flip a bird (x8)
In the kitchen
[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Said I'm here for money making, I've done lost 'bout all my patience
Beat almost all my cases,
 
thought I'd covered up all my bases
Bitches try to play you to some how, some way you figure it out
You fuck with Jay Z's bitch from back in the day
You might end up with 
reasonable doubt
You fuck with grimey bitches
Standing over you taking pictures
While you sleeping cause you passed out drunk after having a threesome
That will give you a reason, to trust no bitch
Quit rapping and just go get it cracking (in the kitchen)
Bout' to push that white instead of that music
Seems like simpler profit, cos nigga's gossiping like they world-stars
M.T.O, Bossip, until I find you and empty your pockets
If 5'9" stop rhyming, I'm driving on I-95 or I am (in the kitchen)
I will cop a key and put it on the scale
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Can't tell y'all, if I did drugs or if they did me
Nah, we were just doing each other
We were side by side like everyday
Didn't care if we ruined each other
Back then it was so real, fully automatic it was overkill
I was on weed, I was on dust, might have tried coke when I was on pills
My pockets had rabbit ears,
 
my mind gone, wasn't on bills
Whole family disappointed in me, can't imagine how that made my mom feel
Her one's missing, guns hidden, sorry Momma, your son's tripping
Got baggies scattered (in the kitchen)
Plus, you and Dad was' on the same road, y'all just left, made it right
If I didn't learn I'd do the same, pour some liquor, say goodnight
Now I'm on this music shit, trying to get this paper right
If not I'll be back (in the kitchen)
[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Let me get it now
On Twitter, they murder my mentions
Cause they heard I was served by a circle of henchmen
Laying in a dirty ditch that bullshit is further than fiction
Their personal mission's worse than snitching
To any person that listen, now I wanna' kill a hater
A middle finger by the 'fridgerator, flip a bird in the kitchen
Cuz DJ Vlad, he was glad, bullets went into me
Just to get traffic for his site, should've did him like MMG
But instead I called up Sway and we cleared that up on MTV
And now I'm back (in the kitchen) but should I be
Cause I heard that Slaughterhouse, is about to cop that Shady deal
But I'm out here chasing that paper still
Push Kush, Coke and crazy pills
Me being shot online, didn't stop my grind
Nigga I don't mind, and if I dont rhyme (I'm in the kitchen)
I will cop a key and put it on the scale
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Just when a nigga thought it couldn't get worse
The hearse reversed; scooped my cuz up after grandma left Earth
That recent shit, I was a young and bummy piece of shit, cursed
No decent kicks cause mom kept enough of that snow to ski in her purse
No father, Jux passed me my first gun, revolver
With the serial carved up
, Real showed me my first jump, 
I'm a barber
Shaving the crack
, 
after weighing the crack
An then placing the crack in 12 12's
I ain't play with the crack, I was making up stacks
All day I just sat (in the kitchen), bringing it back
Now I'm tryna do my thing with this rap
Hope this works, trying to flip words so my homies
Ain't gotta flip birds On the curb
Then black on a yellow belly coward homie feel like Pittsburgh
Lord I thank you, for making me able to find my way through
If not I be back at my momma's table (in the kitchen)
[Hook]

[Hook: Just Blaze]
Some people ask me, where I've been lately
They thought I fell off, nobody can save me
They play in the background, I don't back down
So don't get it twisted or try to play me
First I come out, they underrate me
Then I come back, they still try to fade me
They say I'm nasty, they say I'm crazy
Ask what I think and I say maybe I'll fly away
There ain't nothing in my way so I may as well fly away
There ain't nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I know you wanna see me down but we ain't gonna die today
Cause I done been to the top and there's nowhere else to go
The only way you see me is if you looking up from down below
And there's nothing else to say so I may as well fly away
I'm on top of this game so I may as well fly away
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
And walk around with my pants hanging offa my butt
And you ain't bout to tell me nothing boy get off of my nuts
It goes one for the money, two for the show
My shit don't stink, I don't think so
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll
Are you ready now, here we go, the bald eagle has landed
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leaving you stranded
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands
It's Play-Doh,
 
I ain't back to play, though
They say he died in a fatal car crash, shows what they know
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car
The white trash star, I fuck an RV-up like Brett Favre
Homie you got it backwards, you're dipping your soup
Inside your crackers,
 
I can carry rap til my back hurts
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractor
Get my back right then I'm right back on you bastards
I was chasing the dragon, I don't know what happened
It's like the feeling I had when I first started rappin'
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture that magic
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at when
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I took a hiatus, haters now I'm back to cause trouble
Got the fucking shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles
I'm the...
 
you ain't fucking sick, the hospital
Won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker
You think you hot you ain't even lukewarm
My puke's hotter than you
, 
you're soft
I use fire to cool me off
I told them I would grow up one day and show them
I'd be able to choke clouds
Pick up lightning bolts and throw them
Take the world by storm with these words I form
Georgi-porgi kissed the girls, make the girls cry for it
Make them swarm, make them fight over the shirts I've worn
Sworn over my sweat towels it's mind blowing
Yes I'm living the dream homie, can't nothing compare
I’m so up, I’m stuck in mid air, I’m loving it yeah
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stare
These haters are so pussy they're afraid to be scared
This is pay back, like I owe them back pay
They spat in my face now I'm back to do them the same exact way
And leave this rap game with a bad taste
And slap it back out before I step back outta this crap, they
Slap me now I'm slapping them back hey, fuck it
We're slap happy, yeah okay, now I'm talking some smack, aye
And I ain't looking back, in fact
, 
they can stare at my ass crack
How's that for hind site,
 
what the track say
[Hook]

[Intro - Obie talking]
Yeah! (*echo*), uh
Let y'all niggas know me
Yeah, (WOO!)
[Verse 1]
Eleven, fourteen, seventy-seven a nigga entered
Big lips, popped out placenta
Mom ain't breast feed, had no pop neither
Pop leaves shit but a name - Obie
Elementary homie that's how it started
In garbage, retarded, gainin that heart
Fuck niggas, claimin they hard, a nigga come home touched
My motherfuckin momma bangin me harder
"Nigga take your ass out their and fight them tomorrow"
That's what she told me, "little punk, blame that on your father"
So I had no choice, nigga pick up a brick
Split a motherfucker's shit for tryin to fuck with the kid
Get a little older, hair on my dick, now I'm curious
Niggas on the corner getting money, rockin jewelry
Allowance, nigga that ain't man shit
Cowardice, nigga that ain't man shit
I had to prove to myself
How these niggas same age as me calculatin this wealth
So I got me a clique and niggas what?
Workin one sixteenth, like "nigga we can clean up"
[Hook] - 2X
Follow my life, homie from start 'til now
Only my motherfuckin momma nigga hold me down
And Lord knows all the shit that I done put her through
I speak through her, straight to you motherfuckers
[Skit - Obie talking]
Two for one, here, here take this, two for one
Quit switching dicks, holla at me, see you fuck with
[Verse 2]
Summer '94, I'm gettin a little dough
Taller than my momma, so I'm listenin to her nose
I'm listenin to them hoes scream "O!"
And I'm listenin to them O's go CHOP! (*echo*)
P-Funk, Joe and me pumpin on the block, summertime
I call her auntie, she cop three at a time
Throw a extra bump bringin cline
I'm so involved with the grind, I'm losin my mind
Fuck a steady job, I'm tryin
I steady mob, I'm dyin in this game, I ain't lyin
Sellin so much coke forgettin it's a crime
Flyin down I-75, pocket full of dimes
Give a fuck about the radar on me (*police sirens*)
Bumpin +Big Poppa+ nigga who tryin me?
[Skit] (*Notorious B.I.G.'s +Big Poppa+ plays in background*)
(Cop) - Get off the god damn truck!
(Obie) - Fuck you, yo I ain't did shit!
(Cop) - Put your fucking hands in the air!
(Obie) - Bitch!
[Hook] -2X
[Outro - Obie talking] (*echo*)
Yeah, all my of life
Only my momma know
Obie .. Obie Trice .. Shady and it's crazy, motherfuckers

Yo yo yo
My mom sent me up to the store with a food stamp
For a pack of cigarettes and a book at the news stand (Here)
Two dudes ran up, jumped out of a blue van
I looked down at the ground and picked up a huge branch
I swung it at the first dude, the other one with him
Seen it snap so fast it looked like it broke before it hit him
So he tried to rush, I swept his legs pinned him and bit him
He came back with 6 or 7 dudes screaming "GET HIM!"
I grabbed one lit him on fire pinned and bit him
The next faggot gave me his shoes like they didn't fit him
One by one I just kept droppin' 'em in a rythm
Then I woke up swingin' in the middle of the kitchen
(Damn... damn... damn...)

Oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Well foolish pride has a lot of things to say
You got foolish pride, like you got tooth decay
But tooth decay is another problem
So let's take this old foolish pride problem and solve it
Now, when I talk about foolish pride
I mean blacks and whites taking different sides
When blacks and whites take different sides
Unity never happens
, and we will subside
We will subside and hatred will release
And everything will just crush that peace
But when we crush that peace, you see we start hatin' each other
But remember, you are my brother, and you are my sister
Just like I'm a mister
I seen a black girlfriend and I kissed her
I kissed her, I placed it on her cheek
And she didn't come back til next week
Now it was next week and she was back again
Wanting to kiss a white kid
So she was my girlfriend, we started going out
But that's okay because we were black and white
Blacks and whites they sometimes mix
But black girls only want your money cause they're dumb chicks
So I'mma say like this
Don't date a black girl, take it as a diss
If you want, but if you don't
I'mma tell you like this, I surely won't
Never date a black girl because blacks only want your money
And that shit ain't funny
So I'mma say look honey
Why do you do this?
You know, you step up to me like you a Brutus
Then you try to grab my spinach
Because it's green and that's cash
So get outta here, cause I don't need 
your ass
I said that before, but that's okay because like I said you're a whore
Black girls and white girls just don't mix
Because black girls are dumb and white girls are good chicks
White girls are good, I like white girls
I like white girls all over the world
White girls are fine and they blow my mind
And that's why I'm here now telling you this rhyme
Cause black girls, I really don't like
We don't mix, it's like riding a bike
When you're peddling hard, uphill both ways
You know it's kinda hard and that's why I say to you
I'm giving you a little advice
Don't date a black girl, if you do it once you won't do it twice
You won't ever do it again because they'll take your money
And that ain't funny
So I'mma say look honey
I thought he said that before
But like I said again you're nothing but a big whore
So when mike catch on the bass line
That's okay ‘cause we will not just waste time
I'll get straight to the point
Black girls are bitches, that's why I'mma tell ya you better pull up your britches
‘Cause all that cash is making your ass drag
From the boyfriend you ganked and that's pretty bad
I mean that's pretty sad when you're dating a black guy
And then you turn around and fuck another big black guy
Now that's pretty wrong, but you're just ganking
But that's okay because you need a goddamn spanking
From me, the funky 
M'n'M
I'm busting rhymes and I'm swallowing phlegm
I'm busting a freestyle just like this
I say swallowing phlegm and Howard gets pissed
But when Howard gets pissed that's okay
Because he leaves and he doesn't show up for two more days
So I'll just worry about that problem when I come to it
I'll cross that bridge when I come to it
Because, 
I forgot the chorus
But that's okay cause y'all saying bust a rhyme for us
So I'mma bust another rhyme about this black girl
She turned out to be a fuckin' wack girl
A wack girl, because black girls ain't funny
All they want is your goddamn money
They take you for everything you got
And then you stand with a bunch of snot in your hand
So I'mma kick it to you just like this
How does the chorus go, I forgot
But that's okay, cause I'mma tell you in stride
I'mma say oh foolish pride
Oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride
Oh, oh, oh, oh foolish pride, oh, oh, oh
Date a white girl, cause they got the raw hide

[Hook: Drake]
It may not mean nothing to y'all
But understand nothing was done for me
So I don't plan on stopping at all
I want this shit forever, man
I'm shutting shit down in the mall
And telling every girl she the one for me
And I ain't even planning to call
I want this shit forever, man
[Verse 1: Drake]
Last name Ever, first name Greatest
Like a sprained ankle, boy I ain't nothing to play with
Started off local but thanks to all the haters
I know G-IV pilots on a first name basis
In your city faded off the brown, Nino
She insist she got more class, we know
Swimming in the money, come and find me, Nemo
If I was at the club you know I balled, chemo
Dropped the mixtape, that shit sounded like an album
Who'd a thought a countrywide tour be the outcome
Labels want my name beside a X like Malcolm
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one
Yeah, nigga I'm about my business
Killing all these rappers, you would swear I had a hit list
Everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
If you ain't been a part of it, at least you got to witness, bitches
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Ever-ever, Mr. West is in the building
Ain't no question who about to kill 'em
I used to have hood dreams, big fame, big chains
I stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
And went hard, all fall like the ball teams
Just so I can make it rain all spring
Y'all seen my story, my glory
I had raped the game young, you can call it statutory
When a nigga blow up they gonna build statues for me
Old money, Benjamin Button
 
"What?" nothin'
Now super bad chicks giving me McLovin
You would think I ran the world like
 
Michelle's husband
You would think these niggas know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me
No you fucking wasn't
Um, you're such a fucking loser
He ain't even go to class, Bueller
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my Granny back
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
Chasing the stardom will turn you to a maniac
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act
They pull the cameras out and goddamn, he snap
I used to want this thing forever, y'all can have it back
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Okay, hello it's the Martian, Space Jam Jordans
I want this shit forever,
 
wake up and smell the garden
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans
And I will never stop like I'm running from the cops
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
Life is such a fucking roller coaster then it drops
But what should I scream for
This is my theme park
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark
Pistol on my side,
 
you don't wanna hear that thing talk
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention
Lil' Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer
I'm resting in the lead, I need a pillow and a cover
Shhh, my foot's sleeping on the gas
No brake pads, no such thing as last uh
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Eminem]
There they go, packin' stadiums
 
as Shady spits his flow
Nuts they go, Macadamia they go so ballistic, whoa
He can make them look like bozos
He's wondering if he should spit this slow, fuck no
Go for broke,
 
his cup just runneth over, oh no
He ain't had him a buzz like this
Since the last time that he overdosed
They been waiting patiently for Pinocchio to poke his nose
Back into the game and they know
Rap will never be same as before
Bashing in the brains of these hoes
 
And establishing the name as he goes
The passion in the flame is ignited
You can't put it out once we light it
This shit is exactly what the fuck
That I'm talking about when we riot
You dealing with a few true villains
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spilling
And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
Come flying up outta of our mouths,
 
now rewind it
Pay back mothafucka for the way that you got at me
How's it taste?
When I slap the taste outta your mouth
With the bass so loud that it shakes the place
I'm Hannibal Lecter, so just in case you're thinking of saving face
You ain't gonna have no face to save
By the time I'm through with this place, so Drake

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same O.G. but I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas with no cheese
No deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze, ho please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees
Who you think brought you the oldies
Eazy-E's, Ice Cubes, and D.O.C's
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said motha fuck the police
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop
Or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all
If y'all don't like me, blow me
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me
[Hook: Eminem]
Now-a-days everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch'a gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre
[Verse 2: Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs
Trying to walk it off
Fuck you too bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barking dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (right here)
From here on out it's the Chronic II
Starting today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Slim Shady, hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s
Callin' men ladies,
 
sorry, Doc, but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailie (Dada)
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
With your hands out looking up to me
Like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of Compton
I told 'em all, all them little gangstas
Who you think helped mold 'em all
Now you wanna run around talkin' bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think I sold 'em all, cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Tryin' to get this damn label off
I ain't havin' that
This is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gonna be nothin' after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap, you can have it back
So where's all the Mad Rappers at
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats
Know that I was strapped with gats
While you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

[Intro x2: Eminem]
All the ugly people be quiet
[Interlude Royce Da 5'9"]
Wave (x7)
[Hook: Royce Da 5'9" & Eminem]
I got a house full of bitches, niggas, it is going down
I’mma hold my own, yeah
Bitches laying on the floor like it’s a crack house
Welcome to the frat house
Condoms, kegs, liquor, weed, pills
I’mma hold my own, yeah
Bitches laying on the floor like it’s a crack house
Welcome to the frat house
[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
Your lady’s on my dick, you’ll probably be mad
If you find out I had her skipping biology class
You got comedy cash
I’m a quarter of the Slaughter, half of the dream team, the anomaly Bad
We here to riot the scene
Quiet your entire college up, tie up your dean
My Q-Dog’s on that step shit
I’m 'bout to send a text to my next ex-bitch
Have you on pills, on 'shrooms
Have you feeling like oh-la-la-laa
Now it’s sounding like Lauryn Hill’s in your dorm room
Spit at me wrong, get hit with my new llama
It’ll knock him out his shoes
Dropping more niggas then who dropping out of school
Slaughterhouse gang, streamers, confetti
The squeamish had better get ready, because
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
LBC, we them beach boys
We don’t need your education, we Pink Floyd
I'm getting destroyed
I’m getting oral from a Maury sexy decoy;
 
she on that E boy
She paying tuition with webcam's and PayPal
School in L.A. but she say she from 8 Mile
Her pussy hotter than a chili pepper
I tell her lay down and give it away give it away now
Later on, she’ll be wearing my Letterman jacket
Reach in your pocket (Mollies) medicine packet
Let 'em attack it cause that’s my regular tactic
‘Cuz that’s what let’em get active, whoever said I’m romantic
Is wrong, 
hope you got a powerful chin
Cause they say blowjobs are flowers for men
I’mma need about a dozen, go get your guzzling cousins
And your trouser arousers, we wilding again
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Joe Budden and (Joell Ortiz)]
See I’m an on-stage rock star
(Backstage porn star)
Gave my laptop (Then I threw her on the armoire)
Make it red storm when that Saint John in you
(Brain in the college in Philly, call that Temple
I like a really huge ass)
Bend over, take her to church now she in 
U-Mass
Scoop my 
Spelman
 broad for all out sex
Show her 12 bedrooms, still there’s 
more house

(Titty in my left hand
Drunk as a freshman on his tenth keg stand)
Got a sophomore, all jaw, give me drunk head
Roommate joined in, climbing down from the bunk bed
(Yeah) Matter of fact (No)
(Yo, I am so... throwed)
This pill gave me a new demeanor
(Chris Reeves graduated, I’m a super senior)

[Eminem - talking]
I'd be a horrible mixtape DJ
I would be really fuckin bad
THIS IS MOTHERFUCKIN EMINEM!

Whatever you want to call me
And your listenin to the motherfuckin easy listenin sounds, or whatever
Clear your fuckin ear wax out
This is motherfuckin DJ Kay Slay
The Drama King and it goes a little somethin like this
Yo turn that click off, alright
(*beat to Eminem, Obie Trice & 50 Cent's "Love Me" starts*)
Look...
[Eminem]
My music is soothin', but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump out of ya car while it's movin'
You've been waitin' on this moment, my sermon
Is like a omen; I'm servin'
, 
I'm Erick Sermon
I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit, if you don't get pumped to it
I quit;
 
here's my rhyme book, go 'head and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage 'til ya find somethin'
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumpin'
I'm constantly coppin' over you, squattin'
; 
shit has gotten
To the point where I'm ain't even writin' no more, I'm just jottin'
This is chicken scratch; shit is sickenin', I've been kickin' ass
Off bullshit throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy?
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
, 
page me
You need a beat
... 
you Canibus? Then it's Dre's fee
You Kay Slay? The fee's waived;
 
I stay beefin'
With JD
 
to the day Dre two-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazin' him
Oops, I put it out
I apologize now, it's too late, G
It's on tape, and the tape leaked
"Say what you say," motherfucker!
Drama King, Kay Slay motherfucker!
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucker!
Xzibit, blaze this little gay midget cocksucker

[Eminem freestyling]
Die Bitches, Check it out bitches
All you bitch ass rappers
Need to get your clip pierced
, 
Look at me, hip, I'm Britney Spears
Look at the way I wear my mascara
How you doing
I'm 
Pristina Gaguilera
, And I sing songs about a 
genie in a bottle
And I'm Britney Spears
I got big tits, I'm a role model
To all little kids
But I got breast implants
That was the only way to get my chest enhanced
And here I go with the 
lyrical, miracle, spiritual
 everytime im incredible
With freestyles from the top that I drop
And my instinct
Is to kill
 
N'Sync
And the 
Backstreet Boys
It really doesn't matter coz' I got a scratchy voice
Yo, check it out
But you ask me I ain't gonna be happy til' I see every member of the Backstreet Boys
Getting 
their ass beat
In the back seat of a taxi, And dropped of on the real backstreet
And somebody black sees five little rich white boys
Looking like faggots
With the N painted on the back of their jackets
Ohhhhh
And god damn it
Can't stop there
What's up?
It's over
And this just 
Some Bacardi and Mountain Dew
And wonder how we tune is
Ten million

{Freestyle over Jay-Z's 'So Ghetto'}
[Intro: Eminem (Proof)]
Yeah. Now I'm getting distorted. (Can you turn it down) When I was...I should've been aborted. But it was too late...uh oh. (Uh oh) Yo, just turn up the beat a little bit. I don't care if the mic is distorted. Fuck it
[Eminem]
That's it, that's it, 
gotta hit than pass it
I'm blasted off a tab of acid
Flabbergasted
Hopped in a cab and blasted the cab driver
I said...haha
Hold on a minute
Give me infinite beats that I can kick for a minute
Y'all don't understand
The way that I got this mic in my hand
Killing any MC who stands or sits or walks
Or is handicapped
It doesn't Mr. Handicap, hand me that
Haha
I clap hands with the rap fans
Jump in their wheelchairs and give 'em a lap dance
I'm the illest MC who will kill this
And what?
And Die Hard like who?
(Bruce Willis)
Thank you very much that's a fucking cliche
But I will rock the microphone and don't care about what he say
Or they say or I say or we say or them say
Eminem say shit that only Slim say
Or Slim says
Fuck a les
-bian in her ass
Korean or a...
Haha
[Interlude: Proof talking]
Ayo, let me try something. Uh uh uh uh uh uh. I'm not free in here, check it out
[Proof]
I rap if there was no rap within a soul clap
Expose wack rappers and smack 'em with my bozack
Flatten 'em like inner tubes
Punch my fist through the torso of thinner dudes
And when I'm in the mood make a serious winner lose
Get high of gin and booze
[Eminem]
Hahahaha
In an inner tube
While I'm in the nude
With a centerfold
In the winter cold
[Proof]
Ayo we give it though
Give me an envelope
I get with Tim Westwood show
And Cypher Sounds I strike you down
Don't like the way you sound, you wack now
You got my style packed down or should I say down pack
Any MC's will tell you right now that you sound wack
Call us up and then we make noise then see shells
We shall prevail you faker than Lee Nails
And we tell D-12 to all those that don't know
Flow for flow we rocking your radio
How you feel right now?
C'mon Shady flow
Yo, yo, yo
[Interlude: Eminem and Proof talking]
[E] Yo, turn the beat up a little bit
[P] I know, it's like the beat is like mad low
[E] Hello, hello, hello, check, check, check
[P] Hello
[E] Check, check, check
{beat switches to LL Cool J's 'Ill Bomb'}
[E] What, what?
[P] Awwww shit
[E] Yo, turn the beat up a little bit
[P] Yeah, just turn it up, up, up, up
[Cypher Sounds] C'mon Tim turn it up
[E] Yeah, just turn it up Tim
[P] Let it be distorted. Yo, yo, yo
[Eminem]
Trapped in a cinema, in a material world
Criminal, cops scour the rural area thorough
Cause I kissed a girl, married a girl
Carried a girl to the cemetery, buried a girl
And I'm desperate, no one to mess with
Always get arrested for something domestic
And I kill the way you met me
You'll never catch me, cops can't sketch me
You can't upset me, no matter how bad
How mad you get me
Problem with y'all, I'm letting the Tec speak
Went from sweet to hard
Beat the odds
From no hoes to show, quit the pizza job
No more fools to rob, no more geeks to rob
No more stolen cars, no more Visa cards
(Visa cards)
Slim Shady
(Slim Shady and D-12)

[Verse: Eminem]
Come in spittin', with not writtin', non-fiction
Rappers try to step to this, with no prediction
It doesn't matter cause I'm smashin' and bashin' and crashin'
I hate rappers with a passion
 when I'm chilling with DJ Fashion
Yo, I need a frickin' kleenex, so I die like River Phoenix
When I'm chillin with Phoneix,
 
with two Coronas
I'm on the microphone and I'm a own this
Yo, and I'm a bone this in Arizona
Yo, rappers that ain't able
That can't stay stable,
 
I'm on two turn tables
With my man, but he doesn't matter cause he kicks lyrics galore
And he's only five foot four
Yo check it out I bust rhymes and get, groovy
My man got carded at a rated R movie
But it really didn't matter, he wasn't insulted
He said I'm 27 years old, yo, I'm an adult, kid
But, yo still, Slim Shady gets ill with the skill
And I'm a always bill and kill, my baby's mama
Just to piss the world off, just to piss the girls off
Yo I earl off
The top of the building, kill women and children
And then it hit me
Suddenly my wrists tried to slit me
Couldn't believe it, yo, ya'll can't conceive it
It's Slim Shady, I'll fuck a girl in her cleavage
Bleep that out, and you can keep it, just bleep it
Yo, y'all keep it a secret
I'm top secret, like pop secret
Rappers they don't wanna see
Slim Shady, 
I'm from the motherfucking, D
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-haha-ha-ha
Yo, yo Slim Shady

[Hook: Hittman]
Frontpage Stardom, I'm the golden challenge
(That means we takin over this shit)
Can't fuck wit my whole crew
Frontpage Stardom, I'm the golden challenge
(That means we takin over this shit)
Can't fuck wit my whole crew
Frontpage Stardom, I'm the golden challenge
(That means we takin over this shit)
Can't fuck wit my whole crew
Frontpage Stardom, I'm the golden challenge
[Hittman]
(Where the hell ya been homie?) Shut up man
(Do ya think ya gonna fly?)
Na listen (Everybody's talkin)
So I'mma diss em and keep my ass a fire arm distance
(What is your chrome?)
8 figures (What is your goal?)
Straight nigga (What about your flow?)
How you wondering what you'll spend on this summer you'll see
[Hook]
[Hittman]
Extra Extra! Read all about him! Signed to Aftermath
Now the B-Boys doubt him, females crowd him, decoys
Clone, females want him, everybody on him but he don't
Care bout it when he sees all of them, I remember when
The boy used to be a loner, waitin for the bus to come, posted
On the corner, went to the Crenshaw Country Pub because he
Had no club, now every car he's parkin, he’s the talk of the club
Groupies, and group cheats, eatin raw sushie, high class mommas
On last commas, came along way from selling cobra's and pommes
In line to see Crush Grooveat the Ballroom Stadiuam, now with
Rhymes he touch you, the small niggas hate him,ya'll couldent fade
Him with bleach on your clippers, now on the radio, he played
By a freak named Jigga, see the picture?
[Hook]
[Hittman]
Allow me to introduce myself, I'm sick of foos
Speakin for me like I need help, you usually don't
See me because I be stealth, and you should buy
My cd cause I need wealth, you usually see me
Runnin its never for help, only for prayers, the ones
Who stare, they ain't the one with the least hair on
There head, like white color crime, man i gotta stay
Farigno if I coulden't rhyme I would be pre-made, spending
Most of my time trying to use hairspray, but thats
Not my call cause I'm ballin to stay slanging rap like
Its crack till independence day ,why do you think they
Call me Hitt?? Sign a contract that I supply you with
Weather combat or bombtrack, or your chips, crime
Scene or magizine I'm all over it
[Hook]
[Eminem]
I stay higher than racial tension, with a facial expression
Tensed up like I’m suffering from a case of nasal congestion
Eyes hazel, complexion beige, age still in question
Critics hate my tape kids can’t wait for the next one
As long as there’s rejects, my tape never e-jects the deck
That’s the level of re-spect each cd gets
While y'all are grasping at straws like me snortin' crushed aspirin
And gaspin' at air ‘n collapsin’ in malls
I’m just a realistic impression of artistic expression
Who’s tape was in the deck when the kids shot up delicatessen
So when I — launch a verse full of contra-verse
That’ll haunt you worse than Ma$e before he joined the church
Ok kids I dismiss this class I’m going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas
Umm, Mr. Mathers just missed the bathroom
Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass
This is my last album
 
, this is my last Valium
Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom
If y'all don’t like this shit that you hearing then blow me ‘til your lipstick is smearin'
And I can see my dick disappearin’
[Hook]

[Sample] [4x]
"Fuck it, friends or no friends I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the end"
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I shoulda been able to see that you were the one behind this
But I was blind as fuck to think that you weren't the kind that stuck some more in the spine this
It was as if our friendship broke in half
And watch you turn everything into a game and joke and laugh
And both of us know we can't discuss the situation
Like adults each confrontation just results in accusations and insults
So I'ma just let it go for now
And leave you be, it's over now
What goes around comes back around
[Believe you me, local]? now, come here you fuckin'
[Hook: Proof]
Come here you fuckin' backstabber
Why I oughta, beat a bitch nigga from the hood, haha
Come here you fuckin' backstabber
Why I oughta, beat a nigga that's up to no good, haha
[Sample] [2x]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Why don't you take a second to stop and think about what you done
And you want to call that being a friend, that isn't what you want
All because of what you run your mouth
, 
you wanna prance around and gloat?
Let's see how well you dance around when I got my hands around your throat
Cause it's a matter of time till I get my blows in and it won't be long
You shouldn't go walkin around and stickin your nose in where it don't belong
Cause every time you talked when you was stretchin the truth
Theres gonna be one more flyin' knuckle you're gonna catch in the tooth
Come here, come here you fuckin'
[Hook: Proof]
[Sample] [2x]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Come here you lil double-crossing goin behind my back snitcher
Good for nothin but trouble causin instigating fact switcher
You were the least that I suspected
Till the puzzle fell into place with every piece that I selected
But I'll never let that crap happen again
You come 
back blabbin'
 again
Catch it smack dab in the chin
That's for backstabbin a friend
Cause every name in the book
Wouldn't be enough
So I just figured I'd say your name in the hook
Check it out, come here you fuckin
[Hook: Proof]
[Sample] [4x]
[Outro: Proof]
Backstabbers don't live too long
Around my way friendships betrayed
In the hood you die for that!
For those that don't love this combat and verbally say this
This could relate to the death of a backstabber
Thats like the desire to make social distant vibration combustion of the neck
The backstabber for the female, you sleezin ass bitch nigga!
So remember, the backstabber always loses in the end
A friend is a friend to the end
F-R-I for Fri, E-N-D a friend for the end..yes
To eternity
..
the backstabber shall never flourish
Take em out...

[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Yo its Kuniva, I'll cuss hoes out like a drunk sailor
And cock the hammer back like Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor
You best be on your best behavior before I slay ya
And watch the video of your life with your lord savior
I can go in off your mom, they get along when they see the gun
And dirty dozen cross my arm and it ain't a secret get scared
And be nervous, cuz I'mma be in jail in a cell with C-Murder
Shady is a general, a soldier form I showed it to him
He saved my life I owe it too him,
 so compare it to anybody
I serve you on a platter your words dont even matter
You all you leavin badder, I'm a hazard without bowl and loop doop
I shoot thru people at super markets while they ringin up your fruit loops
You challengers get pushed off banisters
, I'm unavoidable like anvals
Droppin on toon characters
[Verse 2: Swifty]
I'm the freak slasher, chop bodies up in meat packer
I reach back for the necks, choppin your feet faster
Than Steven King, I repeatedly beat bastards
The pops for result of havin a meet in maggots
When I see faggots, put three in they fleece jackets
You bleed rapid, poppin all in ya lead actors
Speed n acids when I mourn, didn't even ask for it
Technique's hazardous, you needin Jesus of Nazereth
To see what's happenin, means havin your teeth chatterin
Speak battlin, heat splatter your peeps abdomin
Sweet fashion, I reload and I keep blastin
I breathe action, if you dont believe ask him
[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I'm sick of bitches man
, 
I done heard enough shit
Talk alot of mouth like they wanna do it
Then they pull down they pants and then I shoot fluid
Then they start runnin screamin like they God called them
And I called them back and then pulled a crackin in
Stick my dick up in and make them rap again
They wanna rap for me and tell me that they love me
Kon Artis your my daddy and I dont wanna be your hubby
I can't be your hub baby I ain't gettin married
I'm stand fuckin bitches, it really very scary
My lil cousin named Terry told me that I fucked him too long
And then I gotta get a Jerry curl to make 'em all keep drippin
You niggas know I never really be trippin, my beats bang
Make ears bleed thru walkmens thats why people ignore you like you ain't even talkin
You chit chatter and get splattered by a disease beat addict
That spit spontanious like a Prayin Mantis I cut you off
Pickin that gang green your man seen how I get ignorant
By losin my spleen the truth of the seen as soon as my team
Get on we rule cities like 'Zila thru Hong Kong, you wanna knew
You wanna know, you gotta ask my man Proof how the fuck the flow goes
[Verse 4: Proof]
Pull it back pull it back pull it back pull it back
We ain't wentin no where, we sippin shampane
Shady records, ain't no body better than us
Shady records, no chedder than us
Shady records, ain't no body better than us
Shady records
, I got your ears goin like its sparkles in my rhymes
Hotter than a fellon in a carload full of nines
Got the sparkles out to shine, get your back up
And get your dollars out ya spines
Because the head is ill I'm in love with Natasha Betinville
Yo faster than a Porsche, make you disappear
Like advertisement in the Source
, so do it baby
I want the sugar baby, my sift from the rabies
Yo Proof D12 is on the haitus, on a scale from 1-10
I'm an 8, wait you dont know how 8 is, 8 is Jigga
Thats me, 9 is Slim, 10 is Slim
, now I finally give you
The time I give you to Bom Artis has got promise
And me and proof and swift and the Kon Artis
And it ain't over boy, who you beef with trust me
I'll tell you Puffy and you can lose big, cuz its that
Face it, I'm a brick face, you get it laced wit a switch blade
Yo I stab you wit a mixtape, tell ya girl ask her how my dick taste
I told you once before that I'm a brick face, I'm a big and I shine plus I spit mace
Make all the bad boys thats missin listen up yo next on this transition
And you know how it is and you know when its gravy next up
Chigga chigga Slim Shady
[Verse 5: Eminem]
I done figured this rap shit out
I map shit out strategically
Timing is everything and that seems to be the key
To my success, it's worked for me repeatedly
Let 'em diss you first, and respond immediately
In order to master the art of war, don't start a war
Shit not no more, we done scared em off, there are no more
Victims to sic, I'm fixin to pick some and start shit
Ain't got no Pictures to rip and shit to throw darts at
Ain't got no more targets,
 
shit Irv and Jeff
We done beat em to death
, 
Benzino
 
in debt
There seems to just be no one left to bully
Bush is pussy
Why the fuck you think his name's Bush?
Puss is bushy
Ain't shit goin on, shit I been gettin so bored lately
I'm thinkin of doin some shit to get you to go and hate me again
To tell the truth, I liked the shit better then
Shit I could spit better, I'm bout to kick this sick shit again, look
The game just ain't the same, it's changin
Shit Dre's quittin, Jay'z quittin
Now it's just wangstas just sayin the same shit
It's fake and it's ancient
It's makin me so bored, I'mma just make a new language
Fubba U cubba kubba, yubba yub yubba yooba
Yooba can subbabick my dubbibbabick through a tooba
Summaladoomalama
I'm not a human I'm a suicider supersonic suicidal unabomber
You think I'm the new Osama, Press thinks I'm the new Madonna
Jeffery Dahmer left me with his legacy to carry on
A lotta talk and rumors honest whos the hottest, to be honest
Hip hop ain't been the same since 2Pac moved to Cuba on us
[Outro :]
Ayo
Shady records, ain't body better than us
Shady records, ain't getting more cheddar than us
Shady records, ain't nobody better than us
Shady records, mufucka more cheddar than us

[Verse 1: Kid Rock]
A shimmy shimmy go go motherfucking pop
It's the K-K-Kid Rock with the K-K-Kid Rock shit
I'm on top bitch and rock for tricks
Hella whips and nips and flip trips for whips
I get all the money pussy falls like rain
Been getting laid and paid that's why I never complain
If I ain't in it for the money I'm in it for the P
It's 1998 yo and you still can't fuck with me
You don't be fucking with the blue eye
Fucking with my 2-5 up your fucking ass like my shoe size
I got a new vibe, kinda like Voodoo
You do what we say and we'll do what we want to
We're fucking up your city and we're fucking up your program
Fucking all your bitches we can fucking give a goddamn
Twisted Brown gets down with no assistance
We won't quit until we're banned from existence
Persistence pays if that holds true
Then I'm gonna buy this fucking planet before the time I'm through
I was praised and raised on the thoughts of no fakings
So let me get what I got coming and the rest I'm taking
I'm shaking like Jerry Lee Lewis and shit
You act like the motherfucker's new at this shit
But I've been true to this shit giving my heart and soul
Been shining like a diamond but getting passed as coal
So Fuck Off
Yeah
[Verse 2: Kid Rock]
With my pants half hanging off my ass and shit
Bowl filled hash pockets stuffed with cash
I be the mushroom tripping sipping shots of Jack
Cause the kids don't listen getting lots of flak
I be the do wa diddy up and down you block
 and
The 10 karat Kid with my triggers cocking
The K the I the D R-O-C-K motherfucker and you still don't know me
So blow me bitch I don't rock for *cancer*
I rock for the cash and the topless dancers
Don't have no answers so pass the joint
I'm just paid in full and made in Detroit
I ride like 
Setta in the Indy 5
And get live with that which get's me high
Strive for perfection this much is true
We do what we say you say what we do
Kid Rock I couldn't be no Bozo
And I get too much P to ever
*be no homo* and my Glock rolls solo to Arizona
I'm an easy rider dreaming of Winona
I roam the country like a Greyhound bus
Put faith in lust and in God I trust
I'm not Peter Pan I don't fuck with fairies
But I bust more rhymes than virgin cherries
And Harry Carey couldn't call my game
Fucked so many hoes I'm in the hall of fame
And I show no shame from coast to coast
I don't mean to brag, but I like to boast
Fuck Off
Yeah right in your mother fucking ass bitch
With that Detroit city shit ain't shit swift we're on the same script
Nothing new since '76 Kid Rock
Yo, 
Slim Shady
 come break these motherfuckers off
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo!
Tell the world to hold their breath, they're breathin' the wrong air
This planet belongs to me and this hippy with long hair
Two white boys who spike punch and light joints
Hang around drugs, loud music and like noise
Slim Shady and 
Brown Trucker
 another bunch of motherfuckers
Who hate the world as much as each other
And I ain't leavin' this party tonight
Till I see some naked bitches dancing around drunk touchin' each other
Rum and Pepsi got your whole perception of me sketchy
Cause when I stage dive people are scared to catch me
Cause all I do is curse and fuck
So when I do shrooms you all better give me two rooms
Cause I'm fuckin' the first one up
So when you see me on your block, you better lock your cars
Cause you know I'm losin' it when I'm rappin' to rock guitars
This is for children who break rules
People that straight fools and every single teenager that hates school!
FUCK OFF!

[Paul Rosenberg]
First Word, Excrement
[Eminem]
Exclimate, is that what you said?
My next defense, against these extra men
Who try to step to me and wanna have sex again

You little sickass, I'll spray em with gasoline
They try to jack me off with Vaseline
My ass is mean, I smash your spleen
When I crash the scene
[Cell Phone]
[Eminem]
With a cell phone, now who the hell is home?
Y'all can't tell Paul how to throw me words
[
Animal Crackers
]
[Eminem]
Cause animal crackers is what I do when I eat MC's like a cannibal
 backwards
Ha ha, I got it, that's not it
Fake rappers been spotted
[Broken Headphones]
[Eminem]
Like broken headphones, you head home, you sped home
You get your head blown, rappers try to step, they speak in the dead tones
So I ain't trying to hear them, give me another, word for your mother
[Stretch Armstrong]
[Eminem]
Stretch Armstrong, my brother, coming with rhymes every time that I be 
drumming
Running with this shit when I kick a bitch in the stomach
And star wars, 
this car's a Taurus
Yo, how many bars we hit tonight, cause I'm drunk off
[Peanut Butter]
[Eminem]
Off peanut butter
, 
you see my dick and you start to stutter
Start to utter, words that you shouldn't utter
[Mark Whalberg]
[Eminem]
Cause Mark Whalberg is a small turd, and I'mma step on him like dogshit
A fore fist, so rappers just get off it, I come across with
[Pulp Fiction]
[Eminem]
With pulp fiction, yo I'll eat you like a big gulp addiction
Like slurpees, got herpes, got a hair piece, rest my anises(?)
Got brain damage
, 
I'm dumber than rain man is
There's mayonnaise on this, I need a plain sandwich
Hurry up, give me one, rappers try to step to this static they wanna give me none
[Fresh vegetables]
[Eminem]
With fresh vegetables, my testicles are hanging off to the left of you
You're bisexual, and there's a guy next to you, standing, rappers know that I
Be-
[Preparation H]
[Eminem]
Preparation H, you didn't even let me finish my rhyme
Just shut up for one more time, while I just shine, on this
Microphone, cause I'mma be honest, any MC who tries to step to this
I'm making you a promise,
 that what? Give me a word
[Nostradamus]
[Eminem]
That Nostradamus is blowing up your house, killing your foster mammas
And coming back to get your parents, well I have it
These rhymes are fourteen karat, solid gold
Rappers step to me, you get your wallet stole
[Times Square]
[Eminem]
In Times Square, I got blonde hair, I'm higher than con air
Rappers don't want to see me, I'll butt fuck Goldie Hawn bare
In a lawn chair, cause I'm there
[Kurt Russell]
[Eminem]
With Kurt Russell, saying "come here Goldie, you want my love muscle?"
I know you want it,
 
I get blunted, then I
Kick these, freestyles just like whipped knees
[Taxicab]
[Eminem]
With a taxicab, 
I'll smack a bitch with a maxi pad
Where we going? Don't ask me dad
Leave me alone, I'm not trying, to even hear you
Dad, I hope you're fucking dying, off this porno mag
Yo, did you see my ad? Yo, wait a minute, did you see my ass?
Is what I meant to say, I meant to say a rhyme that goes this way is elementary
For the century, 
Slim Shady's is gonna be the illest
[Flamingos]
[Eminem]
What? Flamingos?
 
My mother goes out and plays bingo
Every single day, at the bingo hall, that's why my dick is single, small
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
Didn't blow up, just don't give a what? A cuff?
[DT's fired]
[Eminem]
But DT's fired, he's retired, he's not hired, yo plus I'm tired
Of busting and spitting this rhyme nonstop, I'm on top
Taking records to the pawnshop
, stretch
Damn, see my big ick? Catch
Put a D in front of it, rappers don't want none of it
Coming with a ton of shit to spill, Slim Shady out, I get ill with the skill
Baby, aight baby, Slim Shady
Kick eighty million rhymes, till I'm older than Grady
Spilled gravy, all over my damn navy blue avi
Bye bye

[Royce Da 5'9']
Ryan’s a homocidal misfit
I write the solution of biophysics
On the side of a cliff and some hieroglyphics
This my admission to having violence psychotic
With the vile polish politics by the way I’m higher than the Eiffel tower tip
I like writing but I will stick this pencil in your ass before I write ya shit
Pause, inhale hell n kush, 
us and Yelawolf like a heavy foot gas pedal push
Felon’s, crooks, going door to door like he’s selling books, Dolly Parton style, melons mush
Now my bitch dancer, 
I’m bout as sick as cancer
If you could swallow my style, you probably rip ya pants off
If you could bottle my style and sell it to somebody
It’d probably smell like cologne made out of bits of panther
They call me anchor man, I’ll hold down the ship
Leave you niggas floating in water and go and drown a fish
Fuck I’m fucking heinous, I’ll make you fucking famous
Them lead showers is coming, fuck is you sayin’
[Eminem]
Fuck, it’s fucking raining, shit, it’s lightening
Bitch, its thundering, cause I’m hushing up I’m a storm if you wonderin’
Shit, shit you could muster up a thought, to take a toter? and a brain fart
Want urine in your face, all you had to do was say it
You wish you woulda just stayed pissed off in the first place
We came to monopolise the game
Illuminati is here
, yeah, human oddities
At odds with us, just whats gotta be
Cause we started out cold and it snowballed
We froze, soon as we rolled up on these hoes
All’s we know is you over the bar like Limbo/ 
Limbaugh
You know who you are
So quit fucking the 
dark
 before we start 
callin’ you bizaare
Shit screw the 
boots
, ya’ll dun raped a pitbull
Fell in love with Shih-tzu
This is directed directly at you
And as for these hoes who don’t know me from a can of paint
You must be huffin’, fuck a ballsack if the taints can’t take you on a date
You mistake me for a gentleman
, 
your 2000 and late man,
 
Will-I-ain't
I’m the bad guy, type of guy that will drag 5 girls up on stage
Pour ice in their pants and the first one who pee’s gets a black eye
[Hook - Eminem]
You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over
[Joell Ortiz]
Puffing loosies
, watching I Love Lucy with Gary Busey
Crazy, how the fuck could you son me? I’m Shady
Will there ever come a day when they could slay me?
I don’t know, fifth month, black and yellow insect, maybe
Til then I kill the bad man tryna slay me
Everything you kick weak, your speak kung fu yazy
All my homeboys, 2.0 boys
Nickle, I just picked up a Phantom, look how it rolls, Royce!
Even if I wanted to quit, I ain’t got no choice
Verses keep coming, I should invoice my own voice
You should see the kind of asses that my pole hoist
Hoes be like diamonds in your chain, man, so moist
Bang bang bang bang, house gang, chainsaw
Here to kill you p-ssy’s, don’t ask what we came for
I write til my right arm vein’s sore
Forearm feel like Thor’s arm in a gang war
You hear that Yaowa, you know who finna file out
Definitively finish you, my fist stick out that eyeball
Piranha mentality with a jaws bite all night
Coming up, never saw light, but never lost sight
[Joe Budden]
Jets and movers, cess-poolers, meth abusers
You step to us, text rugers to respect the shooters
My men think in sync, roll with the best crew
Move to the beat of the same drum without Lex Luger
Welcome to nay hood, bigger than jects, G
Cheated death multiple times without riggin the deck
So I’m well prepped if you just want war
There’ll be blood everywhere, you be laying on the Louboutin floor
It’s raw, you keep acting like you don’t know Mouse, nigga
And you gon’ need the best doctors, house nigga
Guard your jewels and avoid large tools
Cause after I spill you at the light, you be in a car pool
Keep your distance from idiots, cause the truth told
They food for thought’s rotten, they gems are fool’s gold
Need results from my actions, mistakes I’ll exonerate
I’m Martin King staring at a picture of Obama’s face
Talking funds, niggas ain’t never seen stock
I don’t need the key to the game, I pick a mean lock
[Hook - Eminem]
You must be outta ya mind
You think you fucking with us
Suck on these nuts
Bitch hang it up, this game is over
[Crooked I]
Takeoff, you invited inside of the mind of a psychotic rhymer
I’m kind of a Dahmer
, I’m grinding
Now rappers are lining up jackers, I’m climbing up ladders
I buy enough clappers to retire you factors, fire at drama
You liars and actors, I’m the genuine article
But read me wrong, get my gun and split you to particles, particles
Tell me when and I’m there
Not only heir to the throne, but my chair is suspended in air
Stay fly like a limited fare
You got us pegged wrong, my circle don’t fit in with squares
I smell shit and piss, know where it’s coming from
You stepped on number two just to be number one
Now I’ma step on you, bring it to yo yard
Bogart for arts, we go hard
You frauds just blow hard like broads
, I coast guard the west
I’m 
Mozart
, I compose dark shit with no heart
[Yelawolf]
I got no Jim Beam in the liver
Getting head like clean clippers
, 
with haters on my dick like a jeans zipper
When I throw up 16′s like I drink liquor
You think you seen sick? Well, bitch, you ain’t seen sicker
Then I’ll crack, and then I’ll hop around in a hospital gown
Popping the trunk
, my pumper stay cocking the round
I shit logs and I piss river brown
Cause I drink creek water and spit the river Nile
And that’s as close as I get to a pyramid
Shit
, 
they think I’m Illuminati, so f-ckin’ ignorant
Sick with a grin, here with this pen, so innocent
But when you win, they say you a sin
, but in the end
They jump on the bandwagon and dance to the band playing
Skinny-ass pants sagging, it’s only yourself you playing
Call me a clown, but you love where the clown’s hanging
And the freakshow’s at the county carnival then you pay
Bitch, I’m on a trapeze with no legs in the dark
Yelling “Go Shady” driving slower than an old lady
In an old ’89, no piece if you pay me
Gimme peace sign on my grill, no Mercedes
I’m getting paid for these shows that I throw lately
Same shows a year ago woulda broken most of you crazies
They call me crazy cause I made it
Bitch, you crazy cause you quit, look at my clique lately
You ain’t fucking wit’ Budden, you ain’t got no choice with Royce
You don’t wanna see the Crooked I, well, listen to Ortiz voice
That dirt road hit the 8 Mile, the porno boys
And if Marshall want me to clap, then homie, I deploy
Game over
[Eminem]
Yo, I don’t think they heard you, tell ‘em again
[Yelawolf]
Game Over

[Eminem]
Gee wilikers Gatman, they got me surrounded
[50 Cent]
I'm on my way
[Refrain: 50 Cent]
I got a gat, man, if there's a problem I'mma solve it
A nigga movin' around with a big-ass revolver
And a Mac, man
What the fuck are you retarded
You touch Shady, I'll leave you dearly departed
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
They saying Batman, Robin, Cagney and Lacey
It's 50 Cent and Shady, the worst, baby
You put your hands on my peoples I'll react crazy
Put a hole through your front and your back, maybe
But go 'head, you try me
I'll have your ass hooked up to an I.V
I leave no witnesses when I ride, B
You fuck with me, you'll see
I react like an animal and tear you apart
If a masterpiece was murder I'd major in art
Niggas know I was wrapped too tight from the start
But being a little off landed me on top of the charts
So you take the good with the bad, I guess
Level three Teflon plate on my chest
Hammer cocked back, hollow tip in the chamber, danger
Anger'll change ya, and make you aim and squeeze
[Hook: 50 Cent & Eminem]
I got a gat, man
If there's a problem I'mma solve it
A nigga movin' around 
with a big ass revolver
And a bat, man
Motherfucker, you retarded?
You touch 50 I'll leave you dearly departed
[Verse 2: Eminem]
We're walking away from a beef in which clearly you started
I said we're walking away,
 did you hear me?
You oughta be thankful that we ain't beefin
We'll disagree and just leave it at (that!)
Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that 
(bat!) mobile
It ain't gonna be no more rap it's gonna be, brrat
Retaliation, it'll be like them Muslim Shiia, attacks
Somewhere along the line it's like me and 50 made a (pact!)
He's got my back, I got his back (back!)
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins
Cause when we beef we pull each other into the bullshit
Like we're conjoined at the hip, it's just unavoidable
Some of the shit is squashable; some shit'll never boil over
Some of it will just simmer at best if left alone
But let it be known there will be no sitdowns
With no Daves and 'Zinos, there will be no peace discussions with me
There ain't gonna be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea
Just quit fucking with me and I'll gladly quit fucking with you
Just spit your sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through
Without mentioning me, or the machine of Jimmy Iovine or Dre or 50
Or D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be
Or we'll be (knock knock) with a
[Refrain]
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
Nigga you get it twisted, you gon' get your wig splitted
I don't give a fuck, I don't care if police know I did it
Man I hussle, I get money in the sunshine or a blizzard
I go hard for that paper, homie, I just gotta get it
Got a money scheme, you plot it, you can count me in I'm with it
You cross me you gon' make a cemetary visit
That's gangsta, you know me I talk because I live it
Shell cases drop, when that choppa chop, way up the block
Get hit with copper tops, when the drama pop, hell I'mma pop
And it won't stop, you can run call the cops
This ain't new, niggas know how I be on it
That shit you got, put my pistol to you, I want it
It's not a game; perfect aim; you feel the flame up against your brain
Man it's so hot I make you wish it'd rain
[Refrain]

[Eminem]
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back, back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back *repeat both lines 3x*
You better...
[Proof]
Doin a box of doctrine, on stompin oxygen
? ? wit fork to your optic lens
Hittin wit a sudden force
Leave your boy layin in the same puddle of blood as yours
When I flood his porch
Smuugle a gun in court and shoot the judge
Easily reduce a thug to a future scrub
A double-deuce wit slugs, I'm Proof on drugs
We'll turn you to a rapper that we used to love
How you on medicine cabinet pills
Grabbin the steel, leapin over buildings that haven't been built
I'm not the best yet cuz I haven't been killed
I'm laughin at you faggot-ass rappin for deals, you better
[Eminem]
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better...
I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment
He only gave me the fuckin gas for thirty minutes this mornin
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change
I'm havin a bad day
My fuckin dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fuckin mad cuz I don't have AIDS
All I want to do is die
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right
Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam
I swear to God, this 'Pac poster comes any closer
I'm kickin this whole fuckin wall over
Two more shots and it's all over
I'm all over this wall, tryin not to fall over
[Bizarre]
BLOAW BLOAW!
Shots in broad day
(BIZARRE, THAT'S YOUR MOM!)
The bitch shouldn't have been in the way
Me, Shady and Mike fuckin a hemaphrodite
My little sister was a virgin till late last night
High off a kite off of stick of sherm
Put your mother in a full-nelson while my boys take turns
A unibomber tryin to escape this country
Tell O.J. he better be comin up wit my money
Bizarre goes commerical? Nigga, you can forget it
B-- suck my *dick* that is the radio edit
I'm quick to smack the shit out of a foe
I ain't had pussy in a while, I'm too busy fuckin assholes
Battle me, you better go eat your vegetables
I'm iller than a Muslim eatin a pork hotdog in African festival
This shit is serious, watch me sniff 'cane
Avoid the pain and fuck a bitch barely potty-trained
[Eminem]
Get back, get back
You better get back, get back back
You better get back, get back
You better get back, get back back *repeat both lines 5x*
You better get the FUCK back
"Get back" *cut up and repeated*

[Eminem]
We ready?
Ayo, before...
Ayo, before this CD: "Shit Happens" begins to play
Please, stock up your liquor,
 
your weed,
 
your whores
Bash faggots, 
your popcorn,
 bash faggots
, and your drugs
Bash faggots
, and enjoy the sound of the Detroit's own DJ Butter
Bash faggots, 
this is Slim Shady,
 
and i am high, bash faggots
Oh, and by the way i am not a gay basher, bash faggots

[Intro: Eminem & Kon Artis]
[Eminem]I'm gonna get my gun
[Eminem] This motherfucker wants to disrespect me
[Kon Artis] Em, Em, what the fuck you doing, man
[Eminem] I got something for his ass
[Kon Artis] Calm down
[Eminem] No, YOU Calm down
[Kon Artis] Man, what's your problem
[Eminem] Fuck that, the motherfucker wants to pop shit to me!?
[Kon Artis] Man, he wasn't popping shit
[Eminem] You heard him he was popping that shit
[Kon Artis] What shit
[Eminem] That shit, you heard him
[Kon Artis] He asked for your autograph
[Verse 1: Swift]
A mass murderer, pack burners to blast further then you can get
My shit be shooting through bricks
I mix anything together, 
I done guillotine a nigga
Keep a heater that pop clips with seventeen or better
I'll be severing heads, I'm in everyone's nightmare
A nigga that can never ever be scared of the feds
Send the niggas that'll fuck with you
Stab and brass knuckle you
Then have you in the public, there's nothing that you can do
Enough with you're motherfucking tough talk, you're soft
Get you're balls blew off, from a sawed-off, I'm raw dog
Crazier then all y'all, 
got you like the navy when I'm angry
You'll never catch me hanging in a lops car
All I have is thought of, breathing evil
Desert Eagles will eat through people
When I see you I'mma heat your beef slow
Fuck being peaceful, the piece in the vehicle and
(I'M GONNA GET MY GUN!)
[Hook: Eminem]
This motherfucker's popping that shit
Nah fuck that I'll be right back
I'm GONNA GET MY GUN!
Nah, motherfucker fuck you
You ain't disrespecting me like that
I'm GONNA GET MY GUN!
Walk to the room, sixteen shot clip
Bitch how you like that
I'm GONNA GET MY GUN!
Bet you ain't know that I'm strapped
Nice one, bitch this is my gat
I'm GONNA GET MY GUN!
[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I bring it to niggas looking as if they want trouble
I send they body flipping around like a stunt double
Forget about the fighting, scrapping, squabing, bucking
I'll squeeze the piece you jumping, dodging, ducking
Squat under trucks and screaming "that nigga's bluffing"
I cuff my nuts while cussing "don't trust him"
I round up Runyan, Dave, Wood and Nico
My nigga Big I and Mal' letting the heat blow
Heat seek hoes got in your neepo
Cause you keep shooting at me and missing like Shaq's free-throws
You gotta get a little closer if you wanna try
Pistol whip a soldier, with a missile on his shoulders
We can fold or 
blow your brick house into some tiny boulders
A grimy older cab will leave you with a tiny odor
I'm doggish, you feeling frogish, then leap bitch
My car is right across the street bitch and (I'M GONNA GET MY GUN)
[Verse 3: Proof]
My whole outfit count clips, get your house lit the fuck up
Your spouse shit, and your mouse clip
Better bounce, bitch, countless, slugs I'mma send
Watch you holler when the hollow tips go through your skin
I'm in love with the sin, tell Bugz I'mma see him
When I cock back, right, I’ll put your blood on your friends
Make a rug outta him, bust a slug on his chin
Ain't going no were like the drugs outta Kim
I'm a psycho icon, a mightful might bomb
Get a eye full of lid when I slight your lights out
With a street cleaner, wipe your life out
Bullets know at your ears, like a Tyson fight bout
Fuck the night clout, guns, clips...
(I'M GONNA GET MY)
Fuck that run bitch!
Hit the streets talks, chumps don't know me
Ain't no prob to leave your whole bod' holey
(Hook fades to background music)
Dumbass motherfuckers always gotta come to me with some dumb shit
Fucking
I don't told this motherfucker
Wassup bitch
Autograph this, oh shit
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm trying to pull the trigger but it's stuck, fuck
My shit is all jammed up, ugh
Come on, you cock-sucking, good-for-nothing
Motherfucking piece of shit shoot, ah
Yeah! What up, bitch!? Say that shit again
Shot the bullet missed, hit a brick, bounced of it
Ricocheted back in his shin
Went through his bitch on his way back, hit his friend
Payback homie, don't play that shit is spin
To be on I told you to leave this shit alone
Or... (I'M GONNA GET MY GUN!)
And it's a shame, I'm too drunk to even aim
Denaun stepped in the way and I shot him in his leg
It's like
[Verse 5: Kon Artis]
Bang, bang, bang, nigga, pow, pow, pow
Everybody busting rounds like they Ra', Ra', Ra'
But when you see me in the street I be like, what's up, now
Their bodyguard be stepping in trying to calm shit down
Fuck that! I got a bone to pick
You said it then we should address like some grown man shouldn't we
Then me and you could talk about our problems couldn't we
Just shoot a fair one and handle this situation seriously
I guess not, you want to resort to the heater
So I gotta grab my Mac and my Uzi and my Nina
Step in between us and get shot
But get separated with the squeaza
You ain't ready for war, 
Runyan ain't nothing to play with
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Bizarre]
Walk to Rite-Aid for a can of spaghetti
It's been one hour, bitch, my photos ain't ready
Pictures of my dog and my family reunion
It's been two hours and my fucking days ruined
Hey, Kate, do you wanna get raped
Have my pictures on fucking Philips 38
That's why I don't be fucking battle rapping
Cause every time I loose, this what the fuck happens *Gunshots*
Back to the pictures I was trying to get developed
This man tried to get in front of me, I wouldn't let him
I'm ready to blow this bitch's brains out
I'm nervous, I farted, some shit came out
Times up, shot her with a gun
Got on my cellphone and called Reverend Run
And all this crazy shit, I regret it
All because I wanted to see Elton John naked

[Intro]
Ayo, what do you think about, two grown ass men, living together?
Haha, alright, what do you think about, another grown ass man
Living right upstairs from them?
Well, them two grown ass men living together on my nuts
And that's you right above them
Get the fuck off them!
[Bridge X2]
Run that shit back DJ Whoo Kid!
Run that shit back one more time!
[Verse]
When I rhyme, somehow I think I must be subliminally throwing
Viagra at these fags that got these hard-ons for me
But I suppose anything goes when it comes to my flows
Nothing is off limits
, 
except for Michael's nose
I didn't know, I'm so sorry
, 
please tell me what I can do
To make it up to those of you who I offended
Ooh, I got it, 
I got an apology for Steve Harvey too
It's in my pocket, uh, wait, here it is: FUCK YOU!
Hey! What do you say, 
Andre
? What's new?
Life is good, man I'm chilling, 
50
 how bout you?
Yayo's out of jail, Buck is out on bail, we'll get through, we always do
ODB, rest in peace
, G-G-G-unit!

[Intro]
Yo mic-check Testing
1, 2...fuck
My dick
My nuts
[Verse 1]
My attitude is worse than NWA's was
I'll battle you over stupid shit and diss people
Who ain't have shit to do with it like Cool J does (my tattoo)
You see me standin' outside of your building
Screaming, "Puffy is good, but Slim Shady is for the children"
I look at my life in a new light, fuck it
Give me two mics, I write songs for me
Fuck what you like
You probably hear me rap half-hearted
Cause I don't like rap anyway
I'm just tryna get my porno career started
Every place and event, been there, done that
Shit, Dre stuck me in a suitcase when he went
Want a deal, study these five chapters:
Lesson One: throw demos as hard as you can at signed rappers
Lesson Two: face em and diss 'em
Don't give em a demo; kidnap 'em
And make em come to your basement and listen
Lesson Three: get a job at a label
Switch demos with Canibus and put yours on the owner's table
Lesson Four: know you heard this before
Hey let me get your number I'll call you tomorrow, for sure
Don't act like a fan,
 
you wanna get signed
Get the whitest A&R you can find
Pull him aside and rap as whack as you can
Lesson Five: get a hook-up at Jive
Dress up like I.C.P. and have them come see you perform live
And that's the key, but when you see me on the street
I ain't giving you shit, bitch, don't even bother asking me
Toilet water splashes me right in the ass when I'm spitting
Cause I'm always shitting when I'm rapping like
 
Master P (UNNNGGGGH)
Got a blowjob from Paula Jones
And stuffed it so far in her mouth
My balls broke both of her collarbones
Told Mya this shit was all about me-ah
Gave Alyssa Milano
 
syphilis, mono and gonorrhea
And all three of my main girls said see-ya
Cause Brandy and Monica walked in and caught me fucking Aaliyah
I splish-splash while I'm taking a bath
Grab a handful of pills, break em in half, take em and laugh
White trash, fucking your wife in the ass
While you're out siphoning gas for your lawn mower to cut the grass
[Hook]
So if I hurt your self-esteem and you get dissed too bad
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
And when I rap about a buncha shit you wished you had (a big dick)
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
I can't listen to that song, that shit's too sad
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
He'll never make it, his wrist is slit too bad
You know I just be saying that to get you mad
[Verse 2]
What a wonderful day, I should go outside and play
Ain't no need to sit inside the house and hibernate
Hi Renée, I was just about to toss a live grenade
In your driveway and drive away
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood dripping from it
Ripping your stomach like a paper mâché
You talk alotta shit but you was never ill though
I'm sick enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, steaming this year
I rip [Mystikal's] voice box out and scream in his ear (AHHHHHH)
It's not a gimmick bitch; it's an image, I live it
Give a fuck, I don't know what a fuck is to give it
Yeah I don't think this guy is well, I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll fucking, I'll fucking, lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself and bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back and leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itching to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves
I was teething with strep throat, while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walking through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
(Am I a Blood or a Crip)
Waking up the next day in breathing machines
Flashing back to being shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked
And if you do live, you'll be too scared to tell it like a Biggie and Pac joke
[Hook]

[Intro]
Uhh, hit em with a little ghetto gospel
[Hook: Elton John]
Those who wish to follow me
(My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns
[Verse 1]
If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce
Thinking of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to em
They tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth cause the truth look, strange
And for me it's reversed
We left em a world that's cursed
And it hurts
Cause any day they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothing
Don't it make you get teary
The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined, my ghetto gospel
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Tell me do you see that old lady
Ain't it sad
Living out of bags
Plus she's glad for the little things she has
And over there there's a lady
Crack got her crazy
Guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin pan
We jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back
Will I still keep the courage
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
Cause I chose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
[Hook]
[Outro]
Lord can you hear me speak
To pay the price of being hellbound

[2Pac - Speaking]
The only way, for me to come back, is by Makaveli
That's it! All these motherfuckers stole from me
I'm taking back what's mine
[Slowed down voice]
You motherfuckers can't stop me (laughing)
Even if I die, I'm gon' be a fuckin problem
Do you believe in ghosts, motherfucker?
Real live black... ghosts
Feel me?
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Some say I'm crazy, these punk-ass cops can't fade me
Mama tried to raise me, but had too many babies
Papa was a motherfuckin, joke
Used to find dope in his coat
And nearly choked when he'd tell me not to smoke
Daaamn, don't get me started
My mama smoked so God damn much
When she was pregnant I'm surprised I ain't retarded
At night I can't sleep, count sheep
As they pass through the glass of my neighbors five deep
Starin at the wall, heard a scream
Wake up in the mornin'
See the blood in the hall from the murder scene
Don't cry, just ask why,
 
and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
On the corner, where the niggas slang they crack
And the undercovers jack those that don't watch they back
(Five-0)
 
I daydream about the dope world
Take a puff from the blunt and watch the smoke swirl
My mossberg goes BOOM,
 what's another plug
Snatchin drugs, 
pumpin' slugs in these other thugs
(GIVE IT UP NIGGA)
 Don't run out of breath
Every step could be death 'til you blast
And be the last nigga left, then I'll be ghost
[Hook x2: 2Pac]
Don't cry, just ask why,
 
and try not to die
As I take you through a ghetto nigga's lullaby
[Verse Two: 2Pac]
A seven-deuce full of niggas goes by
Thought I was trippin' the second time they rolled, by
Recognized the plates, the faces looked familiar
Everybody swear they know the nigga that's gonna, kill ya
Don't murder me murder me, killa a nigga in his sleep
Let me die as I rest in peace, deep
Back to these niggas in the seven-deuce
A Mac-10 out the window bout to let it loose, what could I do
Run for cover and return fire
DIE MOTHERFUCKIN DIE, hope your ass fry, don't ask why
But I let off everything I have
An empty clip, hit the ground as a nigga dash
On my ass was the motherfuckin cops now
Barely breathin tryin to keep from gettin shot down
BOO-YAOW is the sound, bullet whizzed by
Still runnin like a nigga got nine lives
Don't know why but I'm running to my fucking block
Took a shot, tired of running from the niggas and the cops
Time to be a ghost
(Hey man, come the fuck on)
And then we'll be ghost
[Hook]
FUCK THE POLICE NIGGA!

[Intro - Eminem]
Hey yo dawg
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest
That that I need to get off cause, if I dont
I'mma fucking explode, or somethin
Now look - this is a story about
Some little girls that I know
It goes like this
[Verse 1]
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening
People are lookin' for an excuse to jump on my shitlist
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, wanted opinions
Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in - shit
I never had no beef with you corny son-of-a-bitches
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it
So I'm tellin you right now - motherfuck a Limp Bizkit
Now I'mma be real, B-Real was real
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin, see he chill
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils
Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies
Hit the studio
 and I'll admit, 
I had a few in me
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentioning me
That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV
Talking bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song
Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?
What's wrong? You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you
You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you
They don't hate you
They just think you're corny since Christina played you
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass
Cause I swear to God 
this ain't just a song I'm tryin' to pre-warn you
Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you!
Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law
That I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow
[Hook 1]
Y'all some - girrrrls - y'all are some god damn girls
Why do you act this way? - Why do you act this way huh?
Why do y'all act like fuckin sissies
 
you pussies
Keep talkin shit behind my back you just some bitches for that
And we all know - we all know
How fuckin' cowards rollll - "Keep rollin' rollin' rollin'"
In-fuckin-dent me's and pretend to be down
But as soon as someone calls you out
You put your tail between your legs and Bow Down
[Hook 2]
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask
Is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion
And I won't put you in 'em
[Verse 2]
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on
But if I help you sell one record
And I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked
See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in
That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away
In my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil
But I will never be this gullible ever again no (nope)
Next time I'll know when someone's copying off me
I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger (hey!)
I say "Fuck 
Christina
" 
he says "Fuck Christina" but meaner
So from doin a song with Method to beggin' to get accepted
I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said
I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin
And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know you're saying fuck D-12
Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves
[Hook 1 & 2]
[Outro]
And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song
Don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song
And then back out at the last minute
And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog
Just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it
That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself
And not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more
I'm on some fuckin-you-up shit when I see you
And I will see you too
; oh, and by the way Fred
That wasn't an accident
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards
Haha

Ha-ha

[Eminem a.k.a. Slim Shady]
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Ready or not here we come, here comes trouble in the club
11, 12, 13, pistols big as M-16's
How the fuck we sneak in with this many 
heaters
 in our jeans?
Nina, two nina's
, a 
piece
, they don't even see us
Some shit pops off we squeeze each one, they're gonna think it's machine guns
Vandals no vandals 
bandanna's with no flannel
Hands around our colt handles, hold them like roman candles
So ban us, go ban us banana fanna fo fannas
Who come back all bananas, banana clips loaded
Managers, bouncers, and the club owners, the motherfuckers don't want us
To come up on and rush in the club and run up in it with a bunch of
Motherfuckers from Runyan
, 
steady popping them onions
Ready set to go nut up, prepare to tear the whole club up
Fixing to get into some shit, just itching to choke someone up
You know we finna loc'n when we mix coke with coconut rum up
Yeah, yeah, ho, what up, see my people posted up
See you talk that ho shit now,
 
when you're down you won't get up
And can't sit up you're so slit up, the ambulance won't sew you up
They just throw you up in the trunk once they tag your big toe up
Heater no heater, automatic no matic
Mag or no mag, it don't matter if I have or don't have it
You never know what I'm packing so you just don't want no static
And open up a whole can of whoop ass,
 
you don't wanna chance to
Risk it no biscuit, milli mac or mac milli
Will he, won't he, don't be silly, homie you don't know me really
You're just gonna make yourself dizzy wondering what the dilly
Fuck it, let's just get busy 
D-Twizzy's back in the hizzy
!
[Hook - Eminem]
Git up now!
 Let's get it cracking, yeah, it's on and popping
Bitch, 
D12 is back
 in this bitch, ugh! There ain't no stopping
We're gonna get it crackalating, what you waiting for? The wait is over
Say no more quit trying to play the wall and 
quit hating
Git up now! 
Yall are still sitting? What the fuck is you deaf
You motherfuckers don't listen I said
We bout to get this motherfucker crackalating, quit, 
procrastinating
What the fuck you waiting for? Get off the wall and quit hating, bitch
Git up now!
[Swift a.k.a. Swifty McVay]
I keep a shit load of bullets, a pitbull it to pull it out
And automatically explode on motherfuckers until they mouth get closed
Permanently, you get burned to line quickly
You can not hit me niggas, too terrified to come get me
Tempt me if you think Swifty won't send a slug, people run
When the reaper comes, the repercussion gon' equal blood
Nigga what? Stepping without a weapon, you leave, you gone
I be still rolling with 
stolen toasters
 
while on parole
Snatch you out our home, like eviction notices ho
When I 
unload
, 
I'm known to never leave witnesses to roam
When I'm blowed, I'll write the wicked in scroll ever told
When I'm sober I'm prone to roll up and disconnect your soul, nigga
[Kuniva a.k.a. Rondelle Beene]
Now it's been proven it's about to be a misunderstanding
In furniture moving, bullets flying, lawyers and mothers suing
Cause niggas don't know the difference, you bitches just stick to fiction
It's sickening, you can't even walk in my jurisdiction, riffing it
Gripping the pump, and who want to fuck with a walking psychopathic
Pyromaniac, Shady cats with 80 gats
And maybe that's the reason that you gon' get it the worst
And since you jumping in front of everybody you gon' get it first
I disperse the crowd with something bigger and versatile
So run and record you verses now while you got a mouth
And it's not a joke, it's some kind of riddle
Kunizzle
 will lift up a 
12 gizzle
 and throw a party from my 
acquittal
And a Glock that you will stop you from walking
Bullets'll hit your liver,
 
I'll even shoot Native Americans
A Indian giver, and nigga,
 we back in your life and back in your wife
Hit you in your back with a knife and get it cracking tonight
[Hook]
[Outro: Bizarre aka Peter S. Bizarre]
Hahaha, Yeah, D12, we baaack
Haha, (Get up now!) Hahahaha
Runyan Ave soldiers
, 
Amityville
Who the fuck want it with us?
Hu-HAW!
Nobody

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My name is Chauncey Billups,
 I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver,
 my crew's liver when you can't sleep and you're still up
I get the ball and I'm like Rip, you can't get a grip
You probably got stripped, you wanna rumble, no reason to trip
I grab her like Gnarls Barkley holds the mic, your snarls spark me
I smile like Charles Barkley
 come on I'm hard, guard me
Ain’t booin’, ain’t pursuin’, no lawsuits, I ain’t suin’
I know what I’m doin’, give me the ball and your life is ruined
I'm like Rasheed,
 I remind me the spirit of Proof
I'm happy and lucky, ballin' and groovin', I'm on the move
I'm smooth with it, give me the ball, you don't know what to do with it
Shoot it in the basket, 
you other teams need a casket
LeBron
 sayin' don't respond, there's no back and forth
This game is mental, man, I play aloud and walk away just to hush the crowd
You trying to touch? Sit down
[Hook]
(Detroit basketball)
Homie like I told you this is(Detroit basketball)
Man I don't think you ready for the
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I get the crowd rolled up Like a U-Haul truck
Just call me 2 Ball Chuck, 
ain't too tall what
I'll leave Utah stuffed
Man I love this game, who the hell you called up?
You need points on the paint, I'm the joints when they stained
All my coins in the bank and I'm...
Yeah baby it's true, I'm talking to you
You already know what to do
Just pass to me, it just so happens to be
That I adapt with this heat so strap in your seat
I got a grasp on this beat, you ain't convinced?
Give it to Tayshaun Prince, we haven't stayed calm since
Leave the ball with delayed palm prints
[Hook]
We get everybody involved homie, we get everybody involved
I said we get everybody involved homie,we get everybody involved
Yeah
Ahh
I said ahh
Give me the ball
You gotta walk before you crawl
Tell me you ain't listenin
This is Detroit basketball Homie, 
hey yo
Beam me up Scottie
Hahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaa

And I’m willing to borrow your grass, but I specialize in eating MCs
In the immortal words of LL Cool J as he would say I'm a G.O.A.T
And for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is, it means the greatest of all time
And I consider myself one of those so thank you very much, here it goes
[Verse 1]
This is the part I was worried about
Everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes
And I'm in some dusty garage inhalin' them carbon monoxide fumes
And everyone's tellin' me what I should do
And how I should come out and what to rap about
And I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out
And I'm not sure how this is gonna come off
They're probably gonna think that I'm comin' off as cocky
Like I just started givin' a fuck what you really think about me
See, the thing about me
Is you don't really know a thing about me
Everyone's makin' a stink about me
Like there's some kind of an aura of that of the king around me
Surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers
And the most dangerous criminals
And I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors
But see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave
Why does it seem like
I'm not even put up in the same category as other MCs
So when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-Z
Please be that just subliminally
Means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's
The only one up in that league, see
And it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is
Knowin' goddamn well that I'm one of the best motherfuckin' rappers who ever lived, period
[Hook]
I'm a G.O.A.T
And I don't mean to gloat
But I know what I know and I know what you think
And these magazines'll never put it in ink
Because how would it look if they considered me as a G.O.A.T
And for those of y'all who don't know what a G.O.A.T. is
It means the greatest of all time
And I consider myself one of those
So thank you very much, here it goes
[Verse 2]
Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game
So they gotta go try to find 'em a new Eminem
Or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen
Man, I thought I was crazy
Or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way
So let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way
See, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringin' up that Paul Wall's white
Cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight
And Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write
Because he's so caught up in that snow white
That Timbaland can't even get him in the studio
He's so gone off that coke, right
And it's so sad, cause he's dope, right
America's next great white hope, right
So now they feel like they gotta come up with
Some corny-ass White Rapper Show, right
And which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about
They said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out
There's somethin' about a white boy talking black
And runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth
And I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit
Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black
And I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that
But these are the people who
Never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out
But I had already hit middle America
Parents had all got to likin' me now
When suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy
All of the hatred for me must've died
Thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy
So faggoty faggoty faggoty gays
Anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy
Not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy
And Angelina Jolie is just another ho
And Brad is a sucka
 
because once I fuck her
She wants to go to Somalia to
 
adopt another baby
You know what I say? No
You better save some of them kids from Madonna
She needs all the publicity she can get
You want a Shady
Well, you got it, man
I ain't apologizin' for shit
[Hook]
[Outro]
Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man
Shit is too easy
Nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause
 I'M A GOAT
So don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game
And y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best
But y'all know that
 I'M A GOAT
And like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best
Before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch
But before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much
To everybody who wasn't there from the start
And thank you very much to everybody who was
And y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it
Cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know that I'M A GOAT
I'm out, y'all
It's been real, peace

[Verse 1]
Ayo, I know it’s been a minute,
 
but we're back
It’s the return of the Dozen muthafuckas,
 let's go
[Hook: Eminem]
Fame-fame-fame, I mean it’s got me going crazy
I'm gettin' lost in this game-game-game, I'm gettin' tired of all you naysayers
Keep speaking my name-name-name and you’ll have reason to hate me
Yeah, it's like you don't want me to win so this time I’m going in
[Verse 1: Swifty]
This the life of a rocker,
 
Jagermeister and vodka
Hopping off at the club balcony into the crowd surfing
And when they drop me, I’m randomly socking fans
In my interviews, wearing hocky masks, left the journalists on their ass
I’m high off speed, driving my car at high speed
Pocket full of weed while lesbians swallow E
In the studio ignant, my engineer gon’ call police
I feel asleep on the sound board, ain't did a song for weeks
And it’s creepy all up in my head, giving thanks for Grateful Dead
Bussing in the air with 30 bitches up in my bed
I’m kickin’ em out naked, and it's December
Niggas ask me why I did it but fuck it I can’t remember
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kuniva]
Them boys are wildin’, drinkin’, cussin’ and hyper smilin’
Been ridin’ for days, tour bus look like Rikers Island
Henny, Jack Daniels, spray painting a die hard fan
Little cockerspaniel, fresh outta the damn zoo
Man you, better be concious I’m backstage living it up
With a couple of sluts feeling nausious, drinking
It’s been a couple of days since I’ve slept
My dick is sore from fucking, when I bust there’s nothing left
Just Dozen, back on the stage, give me my microphone
Scrapping with the audience while we perform hyper songs
Our label presented us with a plaque
Brought it on stage, and bash it to pieces with aluminum bats
Now which one of you bitches down for the cause
Yeah I said my dick is sore but I ain't say shit about my balls
Last call, then we off to the next city
Whatever I didn’t drink on my rider,
 
bag it up and take the rest with me
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, this game has got me going crazy, fuck it I am crazy
What's new? What kind of fucking glue you think I’d be if I was glue?
We lost Proof, he was our group's glue but where was you
When we were falling apart,
 
you were shittin on us too
But no one but us knew we were beefing cause that's what happens
When you beef with crew, it stays in your crew cause it's just crew
But we're back now, yeah we took our time but in one crew
Only thing we're in a hurry for now is to rush you
And we back to say shit you don't got the guts or the nuts too
Pussy, go pick your pussy leaves off your cunt tree, fuck you
Atchoo, blunt you,
 
I’m allergic to pussy, sluts too
Yeah, you think you’re the shit 'til we flush you
Had some bullshit to readjust to, now there's just a few of us left
But it’d be unjust to rob us our just due
So Rest in Peace to Bugz and Proof, this one's for you homies, we love you
But we can’t stop now, we'd have too much of our blood drew from this fame
[Hook]

Don't bother me, not me
Mr Porter, I'm busy
I'm busy
Tryin' to talk to the crowd (okay)

[Hook]
I'm going through changes
I'm going through changes
[Verse 1]
Lately I really, feel like I'm rolling for delph like Philly
Feel like I'm losing control of myself
, I sincerely
Apologize if all that I sound like is I'm complaining
But life keeps on complicating, and
I'm debating on leaving this world this evening
Even my girls can see I'm grieving, I try and hide it but I can't
Why do I act like I'm all high and mighty
When inside, I'm dying,
 
I am finally realizing I need help
I can't do it by myself, too weak
2 weeks I've been having ups and downs
Going through peaks and valleys
, 
dilly dallying
Around with the idea, 
of ending the shit right here
I'm hatin my reflection, I walk around the house tryna fight mirrors
I can't stand what I look like, yeah, I look fat, but what do I care?
I give a fuck, only thing I fear, is Hailie
I'm afraid if I close my eyes I might see her..shit
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, napping at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you, you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughing at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would've had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
"Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it"
Fucking drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gonna do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then
:
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My friends can't understand this new me
That's understandable man
, 
but think how bananas you'd be
You'd be an animal too
If you were trapped in this fame and caged in it like a zoo
And everybody's looking at you, what you want me to do?
I'm starting to live like a recluse
 
and the truth is
Fame starting to give me an excuse, to be at an all time low
I sit alone in my home theater, watching the same damn DVD
Of the first tour, the last tour, he was still alive
And it hurt sore, fast forward, sleeping pills'll make me feel alright
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfuckin right
I ain't slowing down for no one, I am almost homeward bound
Almost in a coma, yeah homie come on, dole em out
"Daddy, don't you die on me, Daddy, better hold your ground"
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice
Yeah baby hold me down
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes, but somehow I'm pulling through
Swear when I come back I'mma be bulletproof
I'mma do it just for Proof,
 
I think I should state a few
Facts, cause I may not get a chance again to say the truth
Shit it just hit me that what if I would not have made it through
I think about the things I would never got to say to you
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do
Hailie this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too
I still love your mother, that'll never change
Think about her every day,
 
we just could never get it together
Hey, wish there was a better way, for me to say it
But I swear on everything, I'd do anything for her on any day
There are just too many things to explain
When it rains guess it pours, yes it does
Wish there wasn't any pain, but I can't pretend there ain't
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers
Heaven knows I've never been a saint
I know it just feels like we just pissed away our history
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost hate to say
I miss you sub consciously, wish it didn't end this way
But I just had to get away, don't know why
I don't know what else to say, I guess I'm

And I..
I'm going through changes
And I...
I'm going through changes
[Verse 2 Brooks Buford]
And breathing's overrated, storm chasing and it's getting later
I used to love her now I hate her, she's a brain raider
Falling in a crater, of lost memories
I'm so out of hand I don't even fuck with me
I'm goin' trippin', drunk and slippin', sleepin' and bitching
Switchin' prescriptions, bangin' a random whore and itchin'
I don't give a flyin' feces, I ain't one with the human species
Slappin' the nurse, tryin' to up my C-C's
I fall apart, take all my pain, turn it to art
Blowin' up a K-Mart and blame it all on Mozart
Fuck I'm surprised I got a deal, every two hours I take a pill
That's where I'm at, it's all surreal
I got imaginary friends, an imaginary life
An imaginary wife and a real knife
Out of here by next weekend
Hung over on the dresser with my brain leakin'

[Verse 4 Danny Boone]
I'm whacked out, on jack and blacked out
Trapped in a crackhour full of d-d-d-d-d-doubt
I got guilt to the hilt, I fight tears and fears
Been out for ten years, hit a big bump off the mirror
Find me at www dot I came to trouble you dot
Com here motherfucker, take your best shot
I'm suicidal, got a lot of demons to fight, I'll
Probably sit in a chair and put my mouth around a rifle
I feel abused the loser blues are my booze, I'm in the who's who's
Of dope fiends and floozies in the land ff beer cans and uzis
Beggers are never choosy
The morning sun is like a sledgehammer to the forehead
[Brooks Buford]
And I'm barely here look in the mirror everyday and slowly disappear
Been through a million and 67 emotions in my short career
Riddle by fear staggered down the street, fall off a pier
Awe, FUCK IT!!

[Verse 7 Cee-Lo]
My heartbeat is racin'
Even though I'm standin' still I can't stop storm chasin'
A soul that shell casin'
So close to overdose the light of day hurts my eyes
Wishin' my death could be a surprise
My life should be more than four walls and the floor
But that's all that is mine, God, give me a sign
Cause I'm tryin' and dyin' at the same time
I'm not hesitatin', I'm waitin'
[Bridge Danny Boone]
And I run away
From the light of day
I am not okay
My soul's a misery

[Outro Danny Boone]
And I run away
From the day
And I am not okay
My soul's a misery

[Verse 1: Joe Budden]
I remember it like it just happened
I could've sworn it was a dream
But in reality it hit me like a nightmare
Or at least that's how it seemed
I just got a grip on our relationship
We was ironing things out, started picking up steam
And when we didn't need it is when it all got heated
And we both said some things that we probably didn't mean
Then God intervened, guess more was at stake
Thought we left nothing over, he put more on the plate
She came home from the doctor with news I've been wanting
Says family was incoming, she's pregnant, twins coming
But that's gotta be a lie
She sighed, couldn't stop the tears coming from her eyes
That birth control she on, for them it's suicide
As long as it's still inside, two of them wouldn't survive
Hard turn from memorable to cynical
Picturing clothes for what would've been identical
Similar outfits, similar names
My deceased kids' ultrasound in a frame
So I'm deprived of my chance to be a better dad
Staring at my twins that I never had
I shed a tear, looking up in the sky
Even though y'all just got here, goodbye
[Hook: Ida]
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
But it's not the end of the chapter
Goodbye, goodbye, so long, farewell
I'll see you again in the afterlife
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
My biological sperm donor, didn't wanna be a daddy
So he hopped in his Caddy and turned corners on us
Turned on us out the clear blue
His last memory of his son is seeing me through his rearview
I still love him yo, but I love his brother more
My uncle showed me love no one could know
Young and poor with a tougher road
To suffer hunger was nothing but Unc' would hold
Us down, help moms lift the motherload
I got grown and
I used to wonder what it would be like to speak to pops as a grown man
He provided that feeling, told me to take my career into my own hands
He was there when I had no fans
My cellphone rings, and after I answer
A voice says "Your uncle's been diagnosed with cancer"
Worst news in my life
Him and chemo going 12 rounds with a disease and they're both losing the fight
I'm rushing up to Cedars-Sinai
Praying for a miracle, I don't wanna see my idol die
Before he did, the look in his eyes
Said "Even though you just got here, goodbye"
[Hook]
[Bridge: Ida]
I'll see you again in the afterlife
Someday in heaven we will reunite
The flesh disappears but the soul survives
Till next time, my friend, farewell, goodbye
[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I walked in your daughter's house, knowing that you gone
But still looking out the corner of my eye, hoping you're on the couch
That call felt like I was beef that had got shot up
Ironic, I was on tour with Tech N9ne and Slaughterhouse
D tried to talk to me, Crystal rubbed my back
, as they was pouring out
I caught the next thing soaring out
Now I'm in the air, in the midwest somewhere
They said turbulence was severe, I don't know what they talking bout
I ain't feel a bump, body numb, mind drifting
I'm sniffling, asthma acting up, I'm whistling
I'm wishing my mother's face looked so much different
I'm kissing my son, my aunt pacing in the kitchen
My vision blurry, still I saw your face clear
What a loss, this time I did more than waste beer
Michelle's strong, she held on, we got all the way there
Then we walked in, she fell on the floor, this ain't fair
You was the voice when I considered them thoughts that ain't clear
Hey granny, I was fifth row at the Grammy's
An award they ain't hand me, but I sat behind Will
And right in front of Wayne, and got seen by the family
I miss the early morning convos, believe me
Regis on the TV,
 
and the best baked ziti
But you had an all white affair, grandpa's all fly
Even though you been got there, goodbye
[Hook]

Chorus:
Scratching:
"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -] Mr. Garrison
Verse One [Eminem]:
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom wouldn't take me
The bitch still hates me
Shit, one day she said, "Go rake leaves,"
I said, "Make me!"
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house
For making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"
Back then, when 
Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fuckin' pricks!
Scratching:
"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -] Mr. Garrison
Verse Two [Obie Trice]:
How the fuck you gonna fuck with O Trice with a staff full of hoes
With one gat and a wack stack of flows?
A whole lot of lip
Thicker than Obie's shit
Oh shit they found your ass floatin' in the ocean
Body part corroded
Cast away
You stretched in a cast today
That's how a real bastard play
Do shit the bachelor way
Creek niggas will blast away
Y'all niggas ain't tough
Y'all niggas funny
Y'all need to roll on WB 20
Niggas think they 2Pacalypse Now
Until they catch a buckshot
Chicken pop a nigga's style
Niggas scared of the firm
Slim, Dirty Dozen and Trice
Come back like thieves in the night
Niggas jump, that's reason to fight
That's reason to rearrange your teeth with the right
Motherfucker

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep
Ain't gonna breathe, 'til I see what I wanna see
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt
Permanently,
 
you just being hurt
This ain't gonna work
 
for me
It just wouldn't be, sufficient enough
Cause we, are just gonna be, enemies
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us
Coming to terms, where we can agree
There ain't gonna be, no reasoning, speaking wit me
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefing, unless
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen
And you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself
I see you D12, and thanks, but me need no help
Me do this one all by my lonely
I don't need fifteen of my homies
When I see you, I'm seeing you, me and you only
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony
Come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful
I'm rid of you, all of you, Ja, you'll get it too!
[Hook: Eminem (DMX)]
Now go to sleep bitch
Die, motherfucker, die
Ugh, time's up, bitch, close ya eyes
Go to sleep, bitch (what)
Why are you still alive
How many times I gotta say, close ya eyes
And go to sleep bitch (what)
Die motherfucker die, bye, bye, motherfucker, bye, bye
Go to sleep bitch (what)
Why are you still alive
Why, die motherfucker, ah, ah, ah
Go to sleep bitch
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
We got you niggas nervous
On purpose, to hurt your focus
You's not MC's, you's worthless
You's not them G's, you's a circus
You's no appeal, please
You's curtains, you use words Kool Herc slurred in two thousand third
You's purping
, 
you's no threat, who's ya serving
When lyrically oughta bury you beneath the dirt when
You fuck with a label overseeing the Earth
Shady muthafucka, O. Trice's birth
And as I mold, I become a curse
So we can put down the verse, take it to the turf
Cock and squeeze, and he who reach the hearse is he who
Depicts fiction in his verse
And as I breathe, and you be deceased
The world believe you deceived just to speak
You's not the streets, you's the desk
Use not your chest nigga, use a vest
Before two's choose ya rest
, you chose death
Six feet deep, nigga, that's the depth
[Hook]
[Verse 3: DMX]
Hey dog, I'mma walk like a beast, talk like the streets
I'mma stay blazing New York with the heat
Stalk on the beat,
 
walk wit MY feet
Understand my pain, the rain ain't sleet
Peep how I'm moving, peep where I'm going
Shit don't seep,
 
then sleep not knowing
But I'mma keep growing, getting larger than life
Easy going with the same one that started the fight
He be knowing how dog get, when dog don't bite
Tried to show him the dog shit, it's dog for life
Grand Champ, and my Blood Line is tight
Cuz it's all good, it's all right
Niggas tried to holla, but couldn't holla back
Now they gots to swallow, everything in the sac
Blood Line, and, we can go track for track
Damn, dog, why'd you have to do them niggas like that
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
All you motherfuckers, take that
Here, take this too, bitch
Uh, Uh, Uh, Uh, Wahoo
We're killing all you motherfuckers dead, all of you
Fake ass gangsters
No more press
No more press
Rot, motherfuckers, rot
Decay, in the dirt, bitch, in the motherfucking dirt
Die nameless, bitch, die nameless, no more fame
Ahh, hahahaha
Yo X, come on man, Obie, let's go, haha

[Verse 1]
Okay, okie dokey Obie's here
No more Focus Hope, O's got a career
And I like your brassiere and there's a party in here
And I'm ready to talk naughty in Veronica's ear
She erotic and it's hot, saw Heineken beer
Put it to the side and invite her to 
"Cheers"
Pull up a chair, swear no drama
Prepare for a player who's working with a MONSTER
I ain't got time to waste, let's vacate the place
Shut blinds and drapes, grind to your face in a grimy state
Concentrate, you will find that your bound to get
But we found what's fate
We can watch two incredible mates masterbate
Why settle and wait
Let's escalate to the nearest Super 8
To your rear is on the mirrors and they smearin booty cheeks
C'mon
[Refrain x2]
So this is my favorite song
Now sing along when the DJ throws it on
And if I leave here tonight and I fall asleep
And wake up, [sound of water dropping], hopefully she got some teeth
[Verse 2]
Okay holy moly derriere
Look around the club booty everywhere
She caught me starin
And my homies darin me to approach Karen
She's model material, but she got a venereal
Tons of baby fathers', baby bottles and cereal
She holla cause I got a lot of dinerio
The DJ's playin Obie song on the stereo
And she's impaired and she wants to be headin home
With the real thing not the dildo clone
And I know I don't wanna be headin home
With some double Ds full of silicon
Ten hoodrat chicks surround me outside
Found me outside, clown me outside
'Til I pop the trunk and they found me outside
Cussin at the bitches screamin "off to they rides!"
[Refrain]
[Verse 3]
Okay rolie polies everywhere *neigh!*
Gotta find a slim chick's atmosphere
Obesity's glarin and she got me fearin
She's gonna come over here and try to eat me literal [crunching noise]
-ly, like a box of Cheerios
Cherry cupcakes and chocolate Tootsie rolls
I'm outta order cause I gotta big girl disorder
So better cover up that blubber or I'll split [feet running away noise]
And I ain't got time to play
Let's investigate another place today
Ladies less in weight and the dress they shape
Dresses pettite, no window drapes
[Obie Trice - talking]
Word to mother, they god damn Okra and beans
Got ya Opera and jeans
Seems to me a little lean cuisine
Wouldn't hurt much, hot don't touch
[Refrain]
[Outro - Obie Trice - talking]
Haha, haha, ha
You gotta have teeth baby
It just wouldn't look right
Look, me big lips
You no teeth, it wouldn't work
You know what I'm sayin'
Haha ha, yeah
I'm feelin' good
Shady Records man
Obie Trice
C'mon

[Intro: Eminem]
What would it take to push a man
Far enough to put something material over a human life
What would drive someone completely over the edge
To do some shit like that for green and gold
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I done filled my lungs up with so much of this Crack smoke
My neck's bloated, my tech's loaded I'm flat broke and I'm pissed off
Mad at the world I've had it with girls and I'm frustrated
Ran to the bus stop just made it and hopped on
Ready to drop bombs on the first person
Who had a nice suit and a watch on
I spot John white collar worker in clean cut
Walked up to him, he's like "What?"
What you mean "What?"
You know what time it is man
At your next stop gimme that rolex watch
With that diamond wristband
Got his green and his gold dashed and climbed in this van
To steal it and seen a man holding a nine in his hand
Shot him from the bottom up
Stole his keys put 'em inside the ignition and got 'em stuck
Hopped out to flee on my feet
Fucked around and forgot that I left my ID on the seat
[Verse 2: Vesuveo]
Your arrival, want survival, but is you fit?
Your arrival, want survival, but is you fit?
I'm rising with the sun
Synthesized with the universal
I'm goin' to be a better man and this be my rehearsal
For the future, this your game
Make a name to get the fame and the dame
Forget the same as everybody who came
Before it's simple and plain
You be a mere facsimile
Fallen like Gallipoli
Thinking y'all from Italy
But I'm the goumba and I'm working hard at my craft
Great grandpa carried concrete up a shaft
What did you laugh? Huh? Yeah you
You think it's funny raising 14 kids
Without no books, without no money
Ma got honey, funny thing it's that you think you're seeing me
A mere reflection in the mirror here I come I'm getting nearer
Coming even closer can you feel a realer presence in your being?
We inside lyrical ride and I advise you now you're seeing
A true seer never fear cause I'm here in your midst forever
Cleverly helping you better see yourself that be my gist
Open fisted let my energy flow we good to go
It's Able bodied, Mr. Zinn, Vesuveo Survivor Soul
Watch 'em fold hold the gold smoke the green gimme the gravy
Give it up don't give a fuck like Slim Shady
[Hook: Vesuveo & Able]
Between you and me I can see in yo eyes
Wise to the next stay in checkmate
Getcha your Green getcha Gold
It come between me and you
Will lost getcha gold heaven hold getcha green
'Tween you and me I can see in yo eyes
Wise to the next stay in checkmate
Getcha your Green getcha Gold
It come between me and you
Will die sold a soul for green and gold now say goodbye
Should I ever live to fulfill this dream
Would I ever kill for the life of the team?
If I ever came between you and the green
Who's the fiend? By any necessary means
[Verse 3: Able]
I chase a dream that's deep like space
To conquer then escape from this place without a trace
But I await to face personal mercenaries
Bounty hunters wanna check me for my nickel bags
I'll be smoking 'til my eyes bleed: red
Meet me if you can then proceed ahead
Reach for what you need now
No time to think just move and react
Who you gonna call when the wall is at your back?
Trying to blitzkrieg me for the sack
Fiends better believe me sure as I breathe
Their teams be getting touched back
Rush me and I cut back the rumor that you only live once
Let's put it to the test so we can live like legends
Down to hold the line like Selassie
Hold the seventh seal of heaven every time
If a subtleties committed somebody fumbled the dime
Winners guzzle the wine I smuggle mine with them
But he who has the whole nine
Will always double down and play for ten
These are the rules adversaries stayin' cool
Shooting glances like pool
While you dying for the change
I'm changing for the principle
Mystical rebel soul in the physical
Behold the gold but don't fold for the green
Untold best unkept secret unseen
A king should only tell his queen one thing
The light sleeper is the keeper of the team
But keep it between you and me
[Hook]

[Eminem]
Met a retarded kid name Greg, with a wooden leg
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with the peg
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a 40
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and formula 44-D
Forget an acid tab, I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead
Waited 'til it absorbed in fell to the floor dead
No more said, case closed, end of discussion
We blowin up like spontaneous human combustion
Leavin you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas
Cross tha bombers
We blowin up your house, killin your parents, and comin back to get your foster mommas
And Im as good at keepin a promise as Nostradamus
Cause I ain't makin no more threats
Im doin drive-bys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets
Im more or less sick in the head, maybe more
Cause I smoked crack today, yesterday, and the day before
Saboteur, walk the block with a labrador
Strapped with more corral for war than El Salvador
Foul style galore, verbal cow manure
Comin together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure!

[Hook: Obie Trice]
You heard it, you want it, you got it, it's crazy
You play it, you bump it, you know it, it's crazy
Hate if you wanna, that don't phase me
I ain't going nowhere right now...
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
It's the fo' pound bandit
The coke hand to hand, and he Detroit bredded
Goddanmit O Trice's back
And Oh, they so adamant I'm still at it
You should see the grill on a faggot if only looks could kill
But O is so accurate over this Mathers track
It's never inadequate I swear these haters need to chill
It's SO automatic that he is above average
Jesus of Nazareth's reached his soul and so
He is a talent that has managed to mechanically use a pen and a pad and the alphabet to get ahead
Niggas mad cuz he single handledly getting this bread
Bitches is in his bed, bullet still in his head
I'm back, fully loaded I'm ready to let off lead
Metal is heavy and I'm ready to let it all rip
The return of the vigilante on that big party and bullshit
You dig? The kid's back you biatch
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
I don't suffer the whispers of these envious niggas
Mad cuz his nuts not in my denim
Wanna be him so much they send slugs to kill him
And keep it on the hush not to become a victim
Vicious, niggas I rid them
I spit, piss on the statistics on that bullshit
I pull up muzzle yell, send the bezel berg back to here
I'mma thug, I'mma clap him till he fail and he fall
I'mma ball, I'm a beast, I'm the streets
I'm the reason you a broad, I'mma boss, I'm me
Obie bout that change, get rich fast
The Claude Van Damme of the game: Kick ass
Trapped until a nigg get out of 'Caine
And bounce back like whiplashes
And dump my cigar ashes on you asses
It's still Trice and Mathers all that matters
Call that other madness, past us
This is passion
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
My feet up, I read up
Read up on a MC who fordid, a overachiever
My Visa tease them in that villa overseas in that B1W with mamacita
G'd up, Jesus my cheese keep reaching up
Planted the seed and then it beamed up
The bean stalk being tall
Now I'm balling on these motherfucking peanuts
Huh, the demons wanna deliver me
Wanna deem him less than enemy but O too slippery
But back on you faggots nigga ain't no sympathy
I don't fuck with you actors I do mine differently
Trice made history, now all these fake niggas wanna mention me
Couldn't wait till I break in this with my entity
It don't even interest me, I'mma keep my energy spitting
Obie is in this to win this and that's the ending
[Hook]

[Intro]
"What is a nightmare?
The dictionary tells us it is a terrifying dream, a nightmare"
[Verse 1]
I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious
'til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack
On Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons
Then we flew the coop to Michigan
 
to start a new be-ditching
Missouri from Michigan didn't work, so we moved
Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again
Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline,
 
last thing I wanna do is listen
She's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Krypton-
-ite, so the walls - I done lost my power to see through them bitches
But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen
Pretending to be blind Superman, cause I had no supervision
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into invisible kid
Disappear out of sight, like a true magician
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different
Music into the picture
 
and it became my new religion
[Interlude]
"I remember it clearly, even today"
[Verse 2]
Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma Nan
Always itching for something to do
Was flipping through the radio stations one day and discovered
This DJ who was mixing,
 
I say it to this day, if you ain't listened
To the Wizzard, you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes
Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch,
 
it's all about them new edition Troops
You get them LL Cool J cooling system
Made that final maneuver to 8 Mile and Hoover
And somehow I saw my future is in this, that's how I know my mission
Little boom box booming, spitting, practicing numerous writtens
When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition
I remember Proof would visit,
 
couldn't wait to play him my new shit
He'd go cuckoo ballistic, go through the roof for his shit
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us
Too existed to do this shit,
 
never quit, too persistent
[Interlude]
"We are the underground empire"
[Verse 3]
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition
If we all band together, there ain't no stopping this shit
Come up with aliases, bipolar opposites and
Be ready to come off the top as sharp precision
If you got dissed at the Shop, cause if they caught you slipping
They'd take your spot if someone got to ripping you
And you forgot your written
Opportunity knocks once,
 
it ain't knocking again
It tried ding-dong ditching shit, I fucking got that bitch in a headlock
Cut off his oxygen, Slim is not budging
Like cocksucking cynderblocks in the wind,
 
now I got a pot to piss in
Spot in that top position, kopping over the opposition
Looking like a dog that's pissing, leg up on the competition
Promising complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson
I'm in a league Muhammad's in,
 
Ali's my colleague bombing 'em
Probably end up on top of 'em,
 
stomping 'em like Ndamukong
I'm Russian like a Ukrainian, LaDainian Tomlinson
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's face
So name the time, place to battle bitch, I'm still in that mind state
Don't make me step on you and make you wine grapes
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words is loose
But you turds better be careful how you choose yours
Cause feelings scar,
 
but egos bruise worse
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers
Now where's your poo, birds? Ooh
No more tripping in bird shit, songs of self-empowerment surging
Words of encouragement, but discouraging the rappers
The Rap Game's God, but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a wordsmith
So let these words lift, cause all I got is bars
For you dumbbells, since yours ain't working out
Each verse is more merciless than the first is,
 
and you ain't got to wear
No shoes and shirt in this bitch to get served,
 
bloodthirst revenge of the nerds
[Interlude]
"That you'll not escape my vengeance"
[Verse 4]
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turning into a non-humble Don
You blind dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on
So start the show, but I need a drum roll 'fore I go on
Better back away from the front row,
 
get launched, show you I'm
Bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fucking Jumbotron
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble,
 
you Bomboclaat
I'll leave you stretched out, like a fucking yawn
So mow the fucking lawn, your asses are blades of grass
And I'm fucking up this whole landscape of rap
The GOAT just ate eight acres, an eighth of that
Was just to make a path and take it straight to your favorite rapper
Oh, look, my notebook looks smoke cooked
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove
Soot, charred debris floating like Oakwood
Was burning,
 
return of the no good and I won't quit
[Interlude]
"And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below
Something that made Godzilla look like a plane"
[Hook]
And I don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, see if I popped your head
[Bridge]
I'm a monster... I'mma turn into a monster
I'm a monster with my dick in your mouth all day!
[Outro]
"I'm not so sure I want to know from whence it came
But the white flesh creature's trail is easily followed
There, before that shimmering veil of light, the ivory skin slug thing"

[Intro: Mark Avery]
Meet Eddie, twenty-three years old. Fed up with life and the way things are going, he decides to rob a liquor store.
 
But on his way in, he has a sudden change of heart and suddenly his conscience comes into play
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Alright stop, now before you walk in the door
Of this liquor store and try to get money out the drawer
You better think of the consequence
 
(Who are you?)
I'm your mothafuckin' conscience!
[Eminem]
That's nonsense
Go in, gaffle the money and run to one of your Aunt's cribs
And borrow a damn dress and one of her blond wigs
Tell her you need a place to stay, you'll be safe for days
If you shave your legs with Renee's razor blades
[Dr. Dre]
Yeah but if it all goes through like it's supposed to
The whole neighborhood knows you and they'll expose you
Think about it before you walk in the door first
Look at the store clerk, she's older than George Burns!
[Eminem]
Fuck that, do that shit, shoot that bitch
Can you afford to blow this shit, are you that rich?
Why you give a fuck if she dies? Are you that bitch?
Do you really think she gives a fuck if you have kids?
[Dr. Dre]
Man don't do it, it's not worth it to risk it
 
(You're right!)
Not over this shit
, 
drop the biscuit
 
(I will!)
Don't even listen to Slim yo, he's bad for you
(You know what Dre, I don't like yo attitude)
[Hook]
These voices, these voices, I hear them
And when they talk, I follow, I follow
I follow, I follow all these voices
[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Stan,
 
twenty-one years old. After meeting a young girl at a rave party, things start getting hot and heavy in an upstairs bedroom.
 Once again, his conscience comes into play
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now listen to me, while you're kissing her cheek
Smearing her lipstick, I slipped this in her drink
Now all you gotta do is nibble on this little bitch's earlobe
(Yo, this girl's only fifteen years old
You shouldn't take advantage of her, it's not fair)
Yo, look at her bush, does it got hair?
Fuck this bitch right here on the spot, bare
'til she passes out and she forgot how she got there
(Man, ain't you ever seen that one movie Kids?)
No but I seen the porno with Sun Doobiest!
(Shit, you wanna get hauled off to jail?)
Man, fuck that, hit that shit raw dog and bail
[Hook]
[Interlude: Mark Avery]
Meet Grady, a twenty-nine year old construction worker. After coming home from a hard day's work, he walks in the door of his trailer park home to find his wife in bed with another man (What the fuck?)
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Alright, calm down, relax, start breathing
(Fuck that shit, you just caught this bitch cheating
While you at work she's with some dude trying to get off
Fuck slitting her throat, cut this bitch's head off!)
Wait, what if there's an explanation for this shit?
(What, she tripped, fell, landed on his dick?)
Alright, Shady, maybe he's right Grady
But think about the baby before you get all crazy
[Eminem]
Okay, thought about it? Still wanna stab her?
Grab her by the throat, get your daughter and kidnap her?
That's what I did, be smart don't be a retard
You gonna take advice from somebody who slapped Dee Barnes?
(What you say?)
 
What's wrong? Didn't think I'd remember?
(I'ma kill you mothafucka!)
 
Uhh-ahh, temper, temper
Mr. Dre, Mr. N.W.A, Mr. AK
Coming straight outta Compton, y'all better make way
How in the fuck you gonna tell this man not to be violent?
[Dr. Dre]
Cause he don't need to go the same route that I went
Been there, done that, aw fuck it, what am I saying?
Shoot 'em both Grady, where's your gun at?

[Ca$his]
Yeah
It's Ca$his, I'm comin, uhh
Shady Records niggas, GO!
Walkin, with a semi cocked, flip down any block
Get cash, plenty guap,
 
talk hard gettin shot
Went to war with the cops, you reach for what I got
Treat you like Singapore, swing a sword, you are chopped
Picture me pistol-free, "Look at me, look at me"
And realizing none of y'all is hood as me
That's on e'rythang, take six to your frame
Your son caught in strays, he gon' die any day
Try and act brave,
 
tell the law my name
I bet your family won't live to see another day
There is no other way, you hearin what I say
I got paper now, I can fight the case
[Hook: Ca$his]
I'm walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule
Walkin through this concrete jungle
Plenty niggas here, ready to mug you, attitude of "Fuck you!"
Nigga you ain't been where I'm from fool
The lames over here, will dump too, we live by gun rule
[Ca$his]
Like Iraq, C-4 in backpacks
You can pull straps but you can't match that
Thought you was lord of shit bitch, why you let him snitch?
Put the gun in your hand, now we can settle it
Put it up, to his head, I can't do it for ya
You, be the trigger man, kill your own brother
See, how it feels when he drops, and he bleeds
I handed you heat, it was your op-tion to squeeze
Drop, to your knees, look at me, and believe
There's only one way to get out of this thing
Barrel aimed at your face, cock back, fire straight
Now at least neither one of us'll catch a murder case
[Hook]
[Ca$his]
Flyin down the 5, flicked out, gettin high
Jump off on Lincoln, roll through, Anaheim
Rush, of a homicide, races, through my mind
Not commit, any crime anywhere, anytime
Stick, niggas for they shine, yeah, you been on the grind
Yeah, take your jewelry off and pass it to me, it's mine
Cohort, me and my cohorts on codeine
Conspire and rioting, robbin niggas for more cream
Step on work, eighth by eighth
Six points off a quarter nigga, stretch that cake
I ain't chillin on the corner, you fall in your order
For eightballs and nope, I ain't holdin nothin short, yeah
[Hook]
[Ca$his]
We live by gun rule!
Shady Records nigga
I'm ridin through to Annis{?}
With my forks up folk, G's up!

[Produced by Emile]
[Bridge: Eminem]
Feels like a close, it's coming to, fuck am I gonna do?
It's too late to start over
This is the only thing I, thing I know
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is
Find different ways to word the same old song
Ever since I came along
From the day the song called, ‘’Hi! My Name Is’’ dropped
Started thinking my name was Fault
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on
The media made me the e-quivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan
Tried to argue, it was only entertainment, dog
Gangster? Nah, courageous balls
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws
And the fangs been out since then
But up until the instant, that I went against it
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain
I thought
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not?
So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised up on
But sometimes you gotta take a loss
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off
And keep plugging, it's your only outlet
And your only outfit, so you know they gonna talk about it
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it... ah
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme?
What I really wanna say is
If there's anyone else that can relate to my story
Bet you feel the same way I felt
When I was in the same place you are
When I was afraid to…
[Pre-Hook: Sia]
I was a... afraid to make a single sound
Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out
Afraid I'd never be found,
 I didn't wanna go another round
An angry man's power will shut you up
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love
Run out of excuses for every word, so here I am and I will not run
[Hook: Sia]
Guts over fear, the time is near, guts over fear, I shed a tear
For all the times I let you push me around
And let you keep me down
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear
[Bridge: Eminem]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents
Hate your appearance
Did you struggle to find your place in this world?
And the pain spawns all the anger on
But it wasn't until I put the pain in song, learned who to aim it on
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part
Was soon as I stopped saying I gave a fuck
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I caused
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone?
And the lights go out in that trailer park
And the window is closing
And there's nowhere else that I can go with flows
And I'm frozen, cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from
Just a bunch of playful songs, that I make for fun
So, to the break of dawn, here I go recycling the same old song
But I rather make “Not Afraid 2”
Than make another motherfucking “We Made You”, uh
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent
When I discuss my lows and my highs
My demise and my uprise, pray to God
I just opened enough eyes later on
And gave you the supplies and the tools
To hopefully use that'll make you strong
Enough to lift yourself up, when you feel like I felt
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt
Just having to balance my dang self
When on eggshells, I was made to walk
But thank you, ma, cause that gave me the
Strength to cause Shady-mania
,
 
so when they empty that stadium
Least I made it out of that house
And a found a place in this world when the day was done
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted
I represent him or her, anyone similar
You are the reason that I made this song
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off
The legend of the angry blonde lives on  through you when I’m gone
And to think I was a...
[Pre-Hook + Hook: Sia]

[Intro: Eminem]
Makaveli rest in peace
Irv Gotti, too much Bacardi in his body
Mouth like a 12 gauge shotty
And Ja said he should be
The lost forgotten seed of 2Pac
To lead this industry into the ways of the man
Follow me!
[Hook: Eminem]
Come get me
If you motherfuckers want Shady
If Pac was still here now
He would never ride with Ja
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
[Verse 1: Eminem]
You ain't no killer, you a pussy
That Ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy
Bitches wearing rags in photos,
 
Ja's words being quoted
In The Source, stealing Pac's shit like he just wrote it
You loud mouths pray to god hoping no one's listening
See 50 coming for me, Oh my god ma, my position
No one will pay attention to me
Please Gotti, here I go, give me this pill
Ecstasy done got me feeling so invincible
Now all of a sudden I'm a fucking madman who screams
Like I'm Pac but I'm not,
 
enemies, Hennessey
Acting like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy
Sweat drip, get me off this trip, someone stop this train
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs,
 
I'mma quit
Saying motherfuckers names before somebody fucks me up
Ain't no pussies over here, partner, see you in hell, fucker
[Hook]
Get off that E
Before you try to come and fuck with me
It's Aftermath here now
Shady Records got it locked
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-locked
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Penitentiaries is packed with promise makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wasting
Institutionalized,
 
my bitches bring me product by the bundles
Hustle hard from a cell
, 
G-Unit
 
motherfucker, we balling
Catch me counting trees
 and when I'm calling, can you set my call
CEO let me sip on Hennessey, can I sip some more
Hell, I done been to jail, I ain't scared
Mama checking in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it
Motherfuckers thinking they can stop 50, they losing it
Lil' nigga named Ja
 
think he live like me
Talking 'bout he left the hospital, took 9 like me
You live in fantasies nigga, I reject your deposit
When your lil' sweet ass gon' come out of the closet?
Now he wondering why DMX blowed him out
Next time grown folks talking bitch, close your mouth
Peep me, I take this war shit deeply
Done seen too many real niggas ball to let these bitch niggas beat me
Black, you's a motherfucking punk and you can see me with gloves
Quit scaring them fucking kids with your ugly ass mug
And you can tell them niggas you roll with whatever you want
But you and I know what's going on
Nigga payback, Tah, I know your bitch ass from way back
Witnessed me strapped with Macs, you know I don’t play that
All these old rappers trying to advance
It's all over now, take it like a man
Irv looking like Larry Holmes, flabby and sick
Trying to playa hate on my shit, man eat a fat dick
Loving this shit that's how you made me
Feeling like I got you niggas crazy
Against all odds, hoping my thug motherfuckers know
This be the realest shit I ever wrote
Against all odds, up in the studio getting blow
To the truest shit I ever spoke
21 gun salute
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
I've been one of the most humble
, 
rep the streets to the core
Hey Jeffrey, what the fuck you come involving me for
It's been a long time coming, like a bless and a check
You see 106 and Park fans don't even fucking respect you
It's kinda funny, 
wannabe Pac
, wanna fake like you thug
Running around talking shit that he ain't capable of
Now let me off this cocksucker whilst we handle you, nigga
If I recall, Violator use to manage you, nigga
Then took a closer look and realized you was an impostor
There's never been a Violator on a Murda Inc roster
Dumb ass, now who's shooting?
Ah made you look
You said Bus singing the same old hook, you stupid
If y'all shooting
I take a look at your man, the bitch shot himself in front of Def Jam
Cheddar Bob ass nigga start adjusting your plan
You let the streets down nigga, 'pologize to your fans
Watch you pull a little stunt like we ain't know what it was
Little faggot desperate trying to re-establish a buzz
I know the shit is driving you crazy, you wondering how
The streets ain't never want you Beatrice, what you gonna do now
Now if you wanna beef with me, then I'm beefing with you
I think about the game and what it's like and 
what would it be without you
I'm finished, I ain't trying to repeat this
JJust cause I'm cool, you shouldn't take my kindness for weakness
[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
It was fun
Next time you got a problem with me
Address me before you try to make shit a public issue homie
And I'mma return back to my regular self
And have fun again
One
[50 Cent]
Hahaha, BITCH! Haha
OUTLAWZ, haha
Makaveli the don, haha
Since you want to be 2Pac
, motherfucker, hahaha
2Pac shoes to big for you to walk in you lil' faggot,
 hahaha
(What do we have here now?)

[Obie Trice]
Babe uh, yeah!
Girl, you my only one though aight, haha
You my baby, fuck all that shit
You're the one for me
Check it out
[Verse 1 - Obie Trice]
Baby I'm feeling the feelings you giving, I'm feelin your style
And I'm willing to let my guard down to figure you out
I'm picturing your figure in a swimsuit wiling
Somewhere in the Caribbean Islands
Cause the vibe you giving me now
Feels like I'm an innocent child
Sinning is never tempting when other womens around
Hands down, this is my vow
I never heard a moan sound so profound
When a nigga's digging you out, phone rings
You cuss them motherfuckers out, quit calling the house!
If I call, you're in route
There's a drought, you look out
I'm on edge, you put the palm of your hand on my head and squeeze
Please believe I ain't scared of commitment
Fuck head from them bitches!
When you could do the same, but that respect is given
Our intimacy is significantly different
[Hook - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
You gon ride for me (you gon ride?)
Then I'm gon ride for you (I'm gon ride)
If you put your mouth on me (put it on me)
I'm a put my mouth on you
Together there ain't nothing we can't do (there's nothing)
Any problem we can see it through (we see it through)
Baby if you promise to be true (you promise?)
I will never put my hands on you
Come on and think about it
[Verse 2 - Obie Trice]
We ain't even got to talk when we see each other
We got it all chalked out when we see each other under them covers
You my lover, I'm your friend, I'm your man, but I'm sayin
Who needs a label, we roll hand in hand
Visions of you having my little man
We joke, you call me George Foreman
Cause I'm namin him O number four, me I'm three
Plus the ol' G like the personality, she say it's meant to be
I'm in the bathroom when you pee
She in the bathroom too when a nigga doo doo, you my boo boo
There's nothing in this world that a nigga wouldn't do to
Satisfy
 - 
this my bitch that ride
My bitch wit the pistol in the ride
A nigga act up she busting, she ain't got to decide
No discussion, she'll put a slug in a tough niggas muffin
You're fucking wit her husband
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Obie Trice]
Come on and think about it
You got a ring about it
Nothing could ever come between or intervene our bondage
Drama we overcome it if we out numbered
I promise it'll be us against a hundred
Rushing to your side when you vomit eating pickles and peanut butter
Eight months later Obie rubbing your stomach
Paying homage to your momma for raising a girl proper
Enough to call O her Baby Father
You ain't gotta bother bout a deal, I swear I keep it real
Raise young O trill and cook a decent meal
It's signed and sealed, you the only female
Hail, my one and only pal come to get me outta jail
Post bail and post up for sale
I swore, I swear we will always live well
Long as I got my bombshell from the hood to the hills
Who's gon stop us? Nobody! We's that deal
[Hook]
[Bridge - Eminem (Obie Trice)]
If you gon stand by me (if you gon stand by me)
Then I'm gon stand by you (then I'm gon stand by you)
If you promise you'll be true
Then I'll never put my hands on you (hands down)
But! don't you play me for no fool (no fool) bitch!
Cause if I put my mouth on you (on you)
After you put your mouth on someone else
Better find someone else new
Come on and think about it

Yeah.. Obie Trice
Shady!

[Intro]
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
[Hook: 50 Cent, Lloyd Banks]
Hands up! Shorty, when you party with me
We goin' way past quarter to three
(I say hands up!) 
I'm good in the VIP
I got my hammer right here with me
(I say hands up!) 
You know when you party with crooks
You gotta learn to respect the jux
(I say hands up!) 
Everything ain't cool as the fame
And this shit ain't as sweet as it looks
(I say hands up!)
You know I'm puttin' something on me
Right before I leave outta the car
 (We came to party)
You go tough talkin' at me
You gon' leave out the club wit a scar
 (We came to party)
We pop bottles like it's all free
'Fore I leave, I'mma buy out the bar
 (We came to party)
You gon' order whatchu want, it's on me
I'm a G, take a look at a star
 (we came to party)
[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
It feels so good to live sucka free
I'm soakin' it all up while your girl's suckin' me
It mean the world to her, it's nuttin' but a nut to me
Look miss, get a grip or let a mothafucker be
I'm a rap star, who 'posed to be ridin' around in that car
Two in the front, 
in the back got the plasma
This ain't a free ride, you gotta have the gas ma
I wouldn't buy a chick a pump that got asthma
And I'm busy so I move a bit faster
You can't tell me yes if I don't ask ya, huh
I'm a bastard, damn near chauvinist, hand over the plastic
Cause they wanna see ya man go in the casket
Rule number one: keep ya gun or get ya ass hit
And that's it, lights off and ya body stiff
By the same niggas you used to party with
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Yea
I cruise through the strip, 
22's on the whip
, 
new Ruger on the hip
Thousand dollar outfit
, never stooge never slip
Follow rules or get whipped, nigga move or get hit
I don't care who's on the strip
It ain't only the Ferrari now, the jewels got 'em sick
Now it's 2006, I need a new bottom miss
It's a'ight, they can talk, I'm amused by the pricks
I'm the news out the bricks, nigga, who's hot as this?
I bet the mansion and the swimming pool got 'em pissed
I ain't a cuddler, I fuck the drool outta chick
My niggas ice-grill, but it ain't the same
They don't see the faces, they just see the chains like
OOH when ya get 'em, they don't know you with me
They probably think the bouncers at the front door frisk me
This regular shit, the everyday mentality
They charged up, don't make me put in the battery
[Hook]
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
Put 'em up
Put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up

[Intro]
[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Roll down the window in the chevy and I listen to the critics but they really
Wasn't saying shit, Buddy, I'm a gutter motherfucker from an Alabama creek, you don't know
Who you're playin' with, They talk so much that I bet one of these pebbles under me get
Laryngitis the wave is so contagious, so who gave it? Apparently I did
Put fish in the back of my boat, I'm a fisherman, I'm a reel 'em in, mackerel
I'm a give 'em ten minutes,Then put 'em back in the water there, just to see 'em all float
And kinda like mixtapes in the back on my trunk, buddy, yeah, I got 'em all sold
In Alabama with an arm and hammer, swimmin' in propaganda, I got 'em all, whoa
Promenade, country boy, get out of my way, gallon of sweet tea, a packet of lemonade
Smackin' a faggot, I crack a bat on the pen and page, no homo, anyway Any stage, rip it any
Way the independent way, look, have you seen his Js?
Footwork, send em' in a rage, feelin' like a millionaire on minimum wage don't need a Mercedes
To take your girl, 
my Chevy is sick, Earl
I let her play with my mullet
, 
while she sip syrup
Hold up, Alabama funk make you lose your teeth like a Mountain Dew soda
Some saltines wanna live in the box, but guess what? I'm the cracker who showed up
[Hook: Eminem] x2
Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard
For me to come up with shit to say. Aay!
I'm at a loss for words cause ya'll already said it all
I think I'm runnin' out of cliches
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!
[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Left the crib with 10 grand bought a hundred pair
I'm the coach I can show you how to be a player
5 faces said the fitted bitches love my hair
Camo shorts go with anything I wanna wear
They let me in the club fuck the dress code
Me and all my niggas rollin' up the best smoke
OG kush from the west coast
Oh you down to fuck? well shorty lets go
Diamonds in my chain niggas tryna steal my lane
Chronic in my brain bitch I'm reppin' Taylor gang
Smoke till I'm insane drinkin' till I'm throwin' up
Only papers if you Taylor'd nigga throw it up
High socks low cuts smell that good weed then you know its us
That yellow car pullin up them niggas ain't hot so they ain't close to us
Down to fly get two fingers and throw em' up
[Chrous: Eminem] x2
Cause sometimes I feel like its so hard
For me to come up with shit to say. Aay!
I'm at a loss for words cause ya'll already said it all
I think I'm runnin' out of cliches
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!
I'm gettin' writer's block. Psyche!

Hard act to follow
Ha, yeah
So come on and come on
So come on and come on
So come on…
[Verse 1: Yah Yah]
Yah Yah
And I’ve been black balled and outlawed like 2Pac's posse
Still no cops, the neighborhood watch could stop me
I’m like Selassie driven in a Dodge Jeep
The God’s peace while i civilise Rah's beef
Unbelievers fall in 2000 leavers
Landing more needles than the route of all evil
Dom perignon, henny
Outsidaz, cause we all scary
Shells Buried from in hell’s very
Skunk glary, my 51 Chevy, gun's near me
Squatting on the wheelie with them truck jewelery
Come on
[Verse 2: Young Zee]
You got a big mouth, when you rap
I whip my dick out
And mouth-slap you and make you kiss my out tattoo
And leave you with wet stains until you bleed red rain
And for the next days you’ll need fucking X-rays for your chest pains
The Outz splurging for drinks, so I bought a round
Fuck the quarter pound, bitch, we lock this corner down
In a fact, you’ll be robing in a black pea coat
I’ll eat gold and flip the remote while you main bitch do me a deep throat
And word is raw since we all can’t get along til I’m dead and gone
Y'all gon' all get shitted on
Come on now
[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)

A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!
[Verse 3: 
Azz-Iz
]
Azz-Iz high as space high
You blonders state side, take sides
And get ate like steak fries
Unwise guys stuffed with televised lies
Till headaches buy size
Blood sung: sci fi
Off the wet pep, I need dregs and take lives
The raw rasta, bang harder and breaks the boxer
Flow's aqua, spada, lada void cutta
Burn ‘em, rip the infrared gutta
And the horror the terror for ya pappa sick and bye bye
Send a chopper, die before ya reach the doctor
C’mon!
[Verse 4: Slang Ton]
It's tha iza mashtons
I ya wanna hit your ass kicked, just hit the av and pick ya stash with sixty bags and
Get this fucking filling craft and get the matches
I smoke more than 50 chimney hatches
I'm never quick to passin'
I smoke and choke off Simon split this pattern
Rip-o-matic, tris-o-matic
Shit, I've had it, get the average nigga blasted
In a half a second, Slang the Fattest on a record
And check it, I ain't half this racket till that ass get naked
Settle for cash and slap, kid, pass the necklace
[Verse 5: Eminem]
Product of espionage
Pissed drunk on pepsi and Scotch
Sticking my fucking foot up a lesbian's crotch while pedestrians watch
Gangsters bow down to a mightier villian
There might be a million outsidaz
Hiding on the side of your building
Say goodbye to your children
Notify your next to kin
Bring some extra men
If anyone on your team expects to win
The effects of gin made me a smart ass with a bossy mouth
Six bouncers had to come and toss me out some coffee house
It ain't a riddle
After you flat line in the hospital
While I'm in the middle row at your funeral wake
Fucking your widow
Someone call the nurse and tell her to strap me down I need a harness
I bleed bizarreness
Spitting blood like Kiss' lead guitarist
[Verse 6: Rah Digga]
Now who be yappin‘ ‘bout they shit the bomb
With them stife-ass tricks you tryna sell nickles for dimes
Boys, I’m that bitch
Chump change be 6 digits
Doing remixes for all them R and B bitches
Ya motherfuckin‘ rosters
Be filled with imposters
Digga not fresh like Lil Kim singin‘ gospel
‘Cause we be the tightest in this whole rap race
You get your contract cancelled like Homeboys In Outer Space
Come on
[Hook]
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (follow)
We be the hard act to follow (Follow!)
We the hard act to follow (Follow!)
(Hard act to follow) Follow!
A hard act to follow (follow)
Outsidaz, come on!

[Intro: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off and I'm fucked up and
Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah
[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess, we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
[Verse 1]
I went in headfirst, never thinking about who what I said hurt
In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst, the brunt of it
But as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far,
 
"Cleaning Out My Closet"
And all them other songs, but regardless I don't hate you
Cause ma, you're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it for you to be too calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to Chemical Warfare and forever we could drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree
Don't mean shit to me, you're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and
It's Christmas Eve, "Little prick, just leave," ma, let me grab my fucking coat
Anything to have each other's goats,
 
why we always at each others throats
'specially when dad, he fucked us both, we're in the same fucking boat
You'd think that'd make us close,
 
further away it drove us, but together
Headlights shine, and a car full of belongings
Still got a ways to go back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest, so my shoulders carried
The weight of the load, then Nate got taken away by the state at 8-years-old
And that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though, but...
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
But I'm sorry momma for "Cleaning Out My Closet," at the time I was angry
Rightfully, maybe so, never meant that far to take it though
Cause, now I know it's not your fault and I'm not making jokes
That song I'll no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
And all the medicine you fed us and how I just wanted you to taste your own
But now the medication's taking over
And your mental state's deteriorating slow and I'm way too old to cry
The shit is painful though but ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you, Debbie Mathers, oh, what a tangled web we have
Cause, one thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
If someone ever moved 'em from me, that you could've bet your asses
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em
And although one has only met their grandma, once you pulled up
In our drive one night, as we were leaving to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths
And I saw your headlights as I looked back and
I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my mom and my dad
So mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet, I guess
I had to get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message
That I'll always love you from afar cause you're my momma
[Hook]
[Bridge: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (Start over)
One without a cause (Clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
My children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girls
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
[Hook]

[Intro: Announcer from Soul Calibur]
Welcome back, to the stage of history
(Yo.. Slim Shady!)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..
 
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you
Battle? I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet, 'til it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses and close it back
With a lit match in it while I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments, laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
[Hook: J-Black]
I see the light at the end but every time I take a step
It gets dim,
 tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'mma drink till my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, fuck the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'mma be so high
That I'mma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke 'til I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just to rock
Now if I pray every night
Do I still have to hold my trey very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a North Face
Nickle nine at my waist,
 
God done lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters
, 
and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
[Hook]
[Interlude: Announcer]
Maxi
 was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!
[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, 
with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen 'bout as sharp as a dagger,
 
walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a black Jag
 
and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of 
lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a Boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care
[Hook]
[Outro: Announcer]
Time's up!
You lose!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you, to understand somethin
g
That when I come up in this bitch I want the fans jumping
I want the fists, pumping in the air, I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks, ladies won't ya fill your cups
Shady's come to fill ya up,
 
are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B,
 
it's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the E.R.,
 
we are strapped with so much
 
TNT
We may blow, no not even CPR from the EMT's
Could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard,
 what's your problem, 
can't you bust a grape?
What's my name? Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them,
 
cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
Cause this shit's getting embarrassing
The fog is thick and the air is thin
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe, la-didi-da-da-da-didi
He makes it look so easy,
 
girl you just hit the lottery
[Hook]
Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on and hell, breaks, loose
Try to restrain us you can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink, no matter what, we, do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse to just, cut, loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on and hell, breaks, loose
[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
This is when shit hits the fan, like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters, your homie rolling with Mathers
Like chaos erupts, 
Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once, 
this song's like a seance, it hums
(It makes them stay in a trance, no choice, they have to dance)
It's like the playoffs
, just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off for what?
 Man, 
you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something you think I ain't smoking nothing
Stay off my nuts,
 
now hit the flo' baby, time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
, loosen up with a little bit of 
Grey Goose
Yeah girl shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose, 
a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves, and we came here to retract the roof
Yeah man ain't that the truth, 
girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch, and this is when all hell breaks loose
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now I know you're feeling discouraged but homie just mark my words
I'm mur-dur-ing the flow,
 
liquid courage,
 
I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit your ho
With speakers knocking it's 3 o'clock,
 me and Doc
Then proceed to drop 
"E"
 and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'
[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in 'fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing, we'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet, move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak, move to the beat, lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there that'll be pretty damn stupid of me
Born and raised in the C-P-T, yeah Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hating on me, 
but I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat,
 
"Dre fell off"? That's news to me
[Hook]

[Intro]
Hello... Allow me to introduce myself
My name is, Shady
; 
it's so nice to meet you
It's been a long time... Sorry I've been away so long
My name is, Shady... I never meant to leave you
[Verse 1: Eminem]
You see that chick in the gym, checkin' me out?
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth
I lose a pill, and I'm recklessly wreckin' the house
That was supposed to be breakfast
, 
where the heck is it now
There's the necklace I lost, right next to
 Stephanie's blouse
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out
Nope, guess I'll re-route
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch
Oh, jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth
Down the hatch, and the feelin' you can't match it
I 
rat-tat-tap
 
on your door with the damn ratchet
Att-ack-tack-tacking a whore with the damn hatchet
A napsack pack with like 40-some
 
Xanaxes
s
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some
 
lap dances
I'm bout to 
relapse
, 
so baby pour me some
 
Jack Daniel's
Forumula 44D
 and 
40
's with 
bad capsules
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back atcha
[Hook A]
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And are you menstruating baby
, 
my lil' friend's waiting to say Hello
The way your titties are wiggling and your booties shakin' like Jello
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yeah
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people gimme 'em
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum
No reason in particular, it was strictly fun
A 
5th of rum
 and 2 bottles of 
151
51 people asleep in my damn living room
Excuse me hun, but what is your name
, 
Vivian
?
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um
Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy, hun?
I'm looking for the torn wrapper, but there don't seem to be one
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm
But disease is something I'm trying to keep my penis free from
I find the package and I'm cool
, 
I immediately run
Like Speedy Gonzales
, see if I see anyone
Who might have a couple of 3's I'm fiending for some
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum
[Hook B]
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
And do you happen to have anything on you to make my mood mellow?
Some are opal and some are pink, some are blue and some are just yellow
Girl I don't mean any harm all I wanted to do is just say Hello
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were
It's hurtin' me to know that I'll be closin' that curtain for good
(Word, word, word, word, word, word, word)
I second that and a third,
 
rushed to emergency surgery
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased
He's no longer getting them free, 100 bucks for these Percodans
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully searched the den
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him
Tirelessly on the phone trying to russle up
, 
muscle relaxants
For his back, and a couple of Pax's, now he's doubling backwards
And he's stumbling back, slipped and fell,
 
hit his back bone
Heard something go crack,
 
Now he's up in the bathroom
Like he's busting a nap, almost ended it that soon
Because of the fact, I'm just busting my own chops
While I'm busting a rap, resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back
[Hook B]
[Outro]
Hello... Allow me to introduce myself

Hello, Good morning
Hello, Good morning

’cause I seen you watching
So let’s go

[Hook]
Cause I’ve been leaning on the bar
Looking cleaner than the star
All these broads won’t give me my props
25 on the bank I be stunting on there ass
And they mad cause the bitch won’t stop
Got your boyfriend feeling like a groupie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
Stuntin like you looking like a movie
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)
And everybody know who the truth be
(You know, you know, we know, we on that)

And I’m the one that you wanna be with
But right now baby you dreaming
Wake up and turn the lights off
[Verse; Eminem]
Hello and Good Morning
Baby I didn’t mean to turn it bad
I know you’re feeling angry just a tad
Cause I took you through the drive-thru and made you pay the tab
Girl I’m so cheap I can turn your Happy Meal sad
You're loco, don’t bother mistaking me for a mogul
I’m more like Fogell, McLovin’, McDonald's McMuffin
Breakfast burritos, fritos, cheetos doritos, tostitos
That’ll be the only thing I feed hoes!
So baby anything with a dollar menu I treat you
My back hand is lethal so I keep you at arms length
So I can always reach you
Get a knee to the gut, thats the only way I say I need you
Lady I’m just trying to get a rim job off the deal
And I ain't talkin’ Giovanni’s on the wheels
So let me see you mommies get ya tail feathers kicking
I’m here to cock block like a square male chicken
, come on

(You know our motherfuckin motto)
Hennessy
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this ol' thug shit
Hennessy
(That's what you sippin on, now what's your name nigga?)
Big ballin' ass nigga named 'Pac
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I was born in the gutter facin life or death
I was a thug ever since my mama gave me breath
These motherfuckers wanna see me die, so who am I
To try to warn 'em, I buck and bomb 'em, them niggas fry
Hey, remember me? Down that Hennessy
The nigga you don't wanna see, let me proceed
My definition of some thug shit, y'all don't hear me
Now that it's poppin ain't no love bitch
I maintain in the game in the gutter's where I still kick it
I'm trying to hustle up a meal ticket
I'm still wicked in my ways, 
a hustler 'til my dying days
Ain't nuttin wrong with gettin paid, so nigga blaze
Cause we some motherfuckin fools
Walkin through the streets wearing jewels, breakin niggas makin moves
Even the cops can't stop us, my enemies flip
When they see me drink a fifth of that Hennessy
[Hook 2: 2Pac + (Obie Trice)]
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
(Yo what's our motherfuckin motto nigga?)
Hennessy
They wanna knows my role model, it's in a brown bottle
(You know our motherfuckin motto)
Hennessy
Hahaha, y'all niggas can't fuck with this ol' thug shit
Hennessy
(That's what I'm sippin on, now let me tell 'em who I be)
Big ballin' ass nigga named Trice
[Verse 2: Obie Trice + (2Pac)]
Now I was born in Detroit on the side that's West
Troubled child comin up I had to ride I guess
Tried to apply myself, them niggas was ballin
My mama couldn't tell me shit, the streets was callin
I was often involved with niggas breakin the law
I look back, 'Pac nigga, we was bankin off raw
P-Funk got it pumpin, he had the connects
Threw the sack to his lil' niggas workin the set
And if you got it you gettin wet, nigga bet on that
Don't come around hurr on that floss shit
Detroit niggas off shit
(Robbin niggas in the do'ways) That's right
(With my four-four, that's the sure way)
And this your road days, All Eyez on Me
We was looney I suppose, you could (die homie)
O. Trice always rep his block
Pass the Henn and that ice
I'm on a track with 'Pac nigga
[Hook]
[Obie Trice]
Yeah, ay 'Pac, 'Pac, nigga Detroit love you boy
You put it down out here, I mean, y'know
Me and my family, my friends, nigga we ride for you always
2Pacalypse Now 'til infinity boy, forever
Shady Records, Afeni Shakur, whattup? Yeah
Obie Trice, pour out a lil' liquor nigga

[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling, like a siren (oh oh)
We don't, want no problems
We don't like them, keep it moving
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
[Verse 1: P!nk]
I just wanna play
Big city, holiday
So get out of my way
If you know
What's better for ya
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)
[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling, like a siren (oh oh)
We don't, look for trouble
Just enough to, see in double
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)
[Verse 2: P!nk]
Drink some pink champagne
I don't know you yet
But we'll forget so
Fuck what they say
Let's run the floor
Until it breaks
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tearing up the night
Lipstick and leather tight
Not looking for a fight, no (oh oh)
High heels and cherry wine
Not wasting any time
We're ticking like a bomb about to go (off!)
[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes, comes the weekend
Hear it calling, like a siren (oh oh)
We don't, look for trouble
Just enough to, see in double
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nothing high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
Im prob-ably not gonna be wanting to pop bubbly
Or Ciroc
, 
I'm not Puffy, but I'mma run the city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a fricking idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, 
big city lights
Little indignity
, 
hot diggity
, 
this Biggie is getting me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you
I'll knock your dick in the dirt, 
bickering worse
Than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel, hanging from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this building
Cause we're tearing it down
, security get out
The fricking way, 
Jesus Chrysler LeBaron it’s loud
I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens going AH AH AH AH cause
[Chorus: P!nk]
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)
(Oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set of your sirens (oh oh)
Here comes the weekend
Set off your sirens (oh oh)

[Intro]
Hey, you wanna hit this shit?
It's that green tongue, Cali bud
[Hook]
I don't need Dom Perignon, I don't need Cris
Tanqueray and Alize, I don't need shit
Nigga, I'm high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I stay high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
Give me some dro, purple haze and some chocolate
Give me a dutch and a lighter, I'll spark shit
And stay high all the time, I smoke that good shit
I'm high all the time, man, I'm on some hood shit
[Verse 1]
Every time I roll up niggas holla roll up
And I tell 'em hold up, you ain't getting money you ain't smoking
In my Benzo, 20 inch Lorenzo's
Smoking on indo, high as a motherfucker
I be on them backstreets, niggas know I clap heat
Only if you got beef, man ,you better holla at me
Niggas get locked up, stabbed up, shot up
Every time I pop up, a lot going on in my hood
I shoot the dice, I holla get 'em girls
Daddy need new shoes, daddy need Pirellis to look mean on 22's
Stash box, Xbox, laptop, fax machine, phone
Bulletproof this bitch and I'm gone
2003 Suburban swerving, too many sips of Henny
The D's sick, they searched the whip and they can't find the semi's
They was just harassing me cause they know who I was
Spent the night in Central Booking for smoking some bud
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Now if you heard I done started some shit
It ain't because I be high, be high
And if you heard I done let off a clip
It ain't because I be high, be high
But I twist that lye, lye lye lye
I get high as I wanna, nigga
Go against me, for sure, you's a goner, nigga
I don't smoke to calm my nerves, but I got beef
Finna crush my enemies like I crush the hashish
If you love me tell me you love me, don't stare at me, man
I'd hate to be in the pen for clapping one of my fans
Let me show you how to greet me when you meet me, when you see me
If you real, my nigga, you know how to holla "G-Unit"
There's no competition, it's just me
50 Cent, motherfucker, I'm hot on these streets
If David could go against Goliath with a stone
I can go at Nas and Jigga, both for the throne
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Now who you know besides me who write lines and squeeze nines
And have hoes in the hood sniffing on white lines
You don't want me to be your kid's role model
I'll teach them how to buck them 380's and load up them hollows
Have shorty fresh off the stoop ready to shoot
Big blunt in his mouth, deuce-deuce in his boot
Sit in the crib sipping Guinness watching Menace
Then oh Lord, have a young nigga bucking shit like he O-Dog
My team they depend on me when it's crunch time
I eat a nigga food in broad day like it's lunchtime
You feeling brave, nigga, go ahead get gully
See if I won't leave your brains leaking up out your skully
I done made myself hot so ain't shit you can tell me
Now niggas calling me to feature, man, fuck your money
I ain't hurting, I'm aight, nigga, I'm doing good
I ain't gotta write rhymes, I got bricks in the hood
[Hook]
[Outro]
G-Unit, are you ready? G-Unit, are you ready?
G-Unit, are you ready? Nigga, ready or not, here I come

[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah... Huh... (hip hop, hip hop, hip hop)
Turn my mic up a little bit (hip hop)
Hit some of this 
Cali guido
 (hip hop)
Listen to some motherfucking... (hip hop)
Everybody got a little story they gotta tell
Niggas ain't heard my shit...hahaha
The life of Bizarre...what!
[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Hip hop, that's the way of life
 
(Word?)
If you think you're nice, then go grab the mic (Grab it!)
Let me tell you my story, cause everybody got one
Grab a pen and pad and start to jot some
Always told myself that I would never be losing
Man, I ain't had no hood, my mother was always moving (Damn!)
From Detroit to Texas, Texas to Detroit (C'mon!)
Goddamn, Mama, what's the point? (the fuck?)
So I would go in my room and pack my little bags (Aughh!)
Jump in the truck with my step-dad
When I was ten years old, I started to feel the hunger
Got a little older, man, the force got stronger (Yeah!)
And me and my rap partner wasn't seeing eye to eye
So he picked up and started a group with some other guys (Haha)
This is hip hop, man, I won't stop
Yo Big Boi (What up?) Gimme a beatbox
*beatbox*
[Hook]
Hip hop, hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop
Hip hop
[Verse 2: Bizarre]
From the 
Hip Hop Shop
 to 
Maurice Malone
 (Uh-huh)
Ten years later, I'm still in the zone (Word?)
7 Mile and Foyer where a star was born (Yeah!)
United we stand, divided we swore (D12!)
And hell yeah, I lived in my car (Yeah!)
Bitch, I was homeless, I would have slept in a jar (Hahahaha)
And Dirty Management, I wish all the best
But me and my niggas, we had to do what's best (That's right)
It was a mess, all them taxes and accounts (What?)
Checks started to bounce, niggas couldn't buy an ounce (Hell yeah)
And now that we platinum, they diss our name (What?)
Like we won't go to the car and get them thangs
And beef, sometimes you don't have a choice
From the fight with Whitey Ford to the beef with Royce (What!)
To the Ja Rules, Benzinos
, and niggas in the club
To the e-dubs and niggas you ain't heard of
And man, I don't know how to use a gun (Naw)
But I'll learn quick if the fucking beef come!
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop
I'd rather be fishing in flip flops, flip flops
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, did, I
Can't see no country singers beefing over some guitar
Riff that Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger
When I was younger I was so eager
To have a gun I would do the same
Couldn't wait to get to the shooting range
Me and my man Goofy Gary just trying to let loose some steam
Motherfuckers laughing cause I couldn't aim
So I'd pull the fucking target closer and just shoot the thang
I used to have this theory: 
keep three bullets in the gun
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan
For each bullet if you got no CCW license
I tried to apply for one, they said it'd take 5-6 months
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come?
Hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk
Now, back to what my three-bullet theory was
I'm triple platinum, I ain't trying to catch no murder one
Figured I'd shoot to wound, probably miss with at least one
But them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up
Then I'mma say it's self defense," how come I had the gun?"
"Was because I was at the range, on my way back from"
This dude approached me on some bullshit
I'd get a year for each bullet at the most
As opposed to having a full clip in that
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety
But it gave me power, 
and it made me crazy
And psychotic, I just got retarded once I got it
Thank God it was empty the night that I got caught with it
What the fuck, man I thought that it was supposed to be
[Hook]

[Intro]
Come on! Put me in my place!
Come on! Put me in my place!
[Hook]
Hit me with your best shot! (x6)
Put me in my place! Come on! (x4)
Put me in my place!
[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Proof died, what happened? (What happened?)
Marshall stopped rapping (Damn!)
I guess that makes me the captain, hit the mattress
Pistol packing, sick assassin
Hit the gas and, get to mashing
D12 broke up, who you bitches asking?
Our clique's relaxing in the hills of Aspen
Popping pills and Aspirin
And I'm the machine that brought Marshall back to life
Told him that my rhymes just have to be tight
So I figured that I would grab the mic
Like a nigga bout to rhyme right after Christ
Sometimes we get mad and fight, right back to the lab tonight
Grab an o and I have to light
That's only right, 
living like a rock star is the only life!
And we are, six grown men, who are old friends
To my nigga Bugz, DeShaun Holton
All the way down, I'mma hold them, D12 nigga, till the world end (D12!)
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Swifty]
Alot of niggas try to underestimate me
Till I come back with vengeance and slice their 
trachea
Yall been placed on a contract for hating
I'mma waste them, one by one, for tainting
My ability to kill a facility, 
I'mma send them to Satan
Fast as a child rapist facing
Life or trifle
, Henny has made me in waiting
They gon' lock me up under the basement
I'm a one man army, marine and navy
You done made me angry, I'm crazy, insane
And maybe I bite the face off your baby
For anyone who try to diss Proof or Hailie
I'mma break their Halo
Put them on the reaper's payroll, erase them and hang their soul
It ain't no hoes here, McVay got a scroll
With names on it, dipped in blood, man I'm cold
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I know you thought we were done, we rose up
Got a gun to make your whole inside fold up
They hit us with the best shot and we're still standing
So tell the world it can lick our scrotum
Straight soldiers, who wanna stunt?
Who wanna be the fall guy? Who want the pump?
Who wanna get slumped just for looking at me sideways
Every time I roll up I'mma keep it blunt
Where did y'all run when we almost lost Marshall?
Y'all did it big like Costco
And 
we back in this bitch like a tampon
Still talk dirty, 
Em's clean like a bar of soap
And you will soon slip, on some buffoon shit
My hand's on a sweeper, yours on a broomstick
So stop looking all stupid, I'm rude and abusive
And strapped, don't make me use it
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Aight, here's where I come in at
I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
I'm stubborn, evil, and insensitive
I'm like nothing you ever seen, pencil in
Hand, it's like I'm holding the insulin
So you might wanna button it like Benjamin
I ain't frightened of nothing, I injure men
Step right in this mark with my henchmen and
Walk, straight to the stage
I ain't here to cause trouble, get the fuck out my face
Fall back, little cocksucker
I ain't 
A&W
, don't get your cold mugs in my way
Get 'em? Shattered
, 
fucking A
Been this way since B.C., what can I say?
I'm stuck in my ways like double stick tape
Don't get turned to a vegetable dick face
You ain't Superman, stay in your lane, Lois
D12 spitting flames like flamethrowers
Spit 'til we get sprained jaws with metaphors
That cut with the same force as chainsaws
Hope you're coming with your A game
Cause things have changed in this game, isn't the same game, boys
The stakes have been raised, better make lemonade
When they give you lemons, if they want us, let 'em aim for us
[Hook]

[Intro]
Yo, I can't sing, I feel like singing, I wanna fuckin' sing
Cause I'm happy.. yeah, I'm happy!
 
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out
[Verse 1]
Somedays I sit, staring out the window
Watching this world pass me by
Sometimes I think, there's nothing to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
[Hook]
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin on me
Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me
[Verse 2]
My baby girl, keeps getting older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes, cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Man if I could sing, I'd keep singing this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes,
 
I'd blow something as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy,
 
I'm so glad that her mom didn't
 
*want her*
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'mma pistol packing drug addict who bags on his mama
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
Cause there's a lotta shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breaking
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life living hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facing, three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it coming, what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fucking
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie
So sayonara,
 
try tommorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get,
 
the weight has been lifted
[Hook]
And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leaning on me
Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothing can take her from me
[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing, oh well, I tried
Hailie, remember when I said, if you ever need anything
Daddy would be right there? Guess what?
Daddy's here, and I ain't going nowhere baby
I love you {*smooch*}

[Eminem - Talking]
So I changed huh, you got a phone
Pick up and call me
[Hook - Eminem]
How Come.. we don't even talk no more and you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all and I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine we even beefing now
After all the years we've been down
Ain't no way no how. This bullshit can't be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
We were so young so full of life and vibrance
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some Bonnie and Clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it
You even had the same type of childhood I did
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succame to yours
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just can't describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it your cold your touch is just like ice
And your eyes is a look of resentment I can sense it and I don't like it
[Hook - Eminem]
[Verse 2 - 
Kon Artis
]
It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
'Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worrisome
Bitch that I wasn't with I woulda hit it and quit
But you were playing to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her you would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or something
But me catching her fucking other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you woof off at the mouth to people like you want it with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And ever since the fans and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I ain't your man and lying like she can't be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Don't hate the game or the player the one that's changing is you
[Hook - Eminem]
[Verse 3 - Proof]
Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch get to speaking all rude
Fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snapping and poof it just happen
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown
Shady made it so my babies ain't starving at home
See the devil in your glance since the ghetto we been friends
Forever real intelligence that's forever till the end
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the Satan in your lies
Ain't wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life?
And every time I go to hear you play, you look away
We barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face
[Eminem]
How come?
[Verse 4 - Bizarre]
When we started dating I was almost 9
Now I'm 35 missing that big behind
And all I do is drive think about our lives
Come home every night dodging butcher knives
And I ain't gon' lie I like the attention
Sleeping with other wives saying I'm out fishing
Let's put it all behind let's settle our difference
You ready to talk I'm ready to listen
[Verse 5 - Swifty Mcvay]
Back in the days I was feening for fame
It's a shame rappers just like coochie you kick game until you bang
And every waking morning I'm doing the same thing
Just hanging and brainstorming just trying to make a name
When you blessing the game
That's when everyone around you whole persception will change
And you accept it cuz you made it
But when your funds faded your treated like a scoundrel
Obviously your homies never gave a shit about you
I pain my dues twice and I ain't lying
See that's first in the hood and the other after I signed
No time for being kind when your enemies shown
I walk alone while y'all trying anything to get on
[Hook - Eminem]

[Verse 1: Redman]
Word is bond
, Redman
 
makes the kids run
I'm seeing dead people creepin' on my income
Piercing the ear drums, how the fuck he do it?
Got little miniture Redmans, crawlin' into it, cause my
Back against the wall get to actin' like a fool
That's what happens to students, when you keep 'em after school
I stay a wild child, beef, bring it like "Raow! Raow!"
My guns go boom, boom, and your guns go pow pow!
Still, I feel a chill, bumps in my body
The spirits of other MC's records in the party
Cause, me being, the man that I am
I'm awfully hunted by them guns with wide lens on the scope
Sucka, you miss, I'm a get my laugh on
You fuck around and woke up, 
with the stash gone
How I spaz on niggas is ugly
You got the game fucked up on makin' the money
See I don't say I'm thugged out, but I know my choice
Back up plans, got back up; if I blow my voice
That's why I'm Brick City, 
can't wait to put my niggas on
To see us perform, we sellin' out at Ticket Tron
What I'm doing is wrong, 
but It lasts long
Yo, toast the niggas that passed on
Get it while the gettin good, whole life with a grip
Cause when it's gone, 
that's it, that's it, that's it!
[Hook 2X]
I'm seeing dead people creepin on my income
You win some, you lose some, but you never run
[Verse2: Redman]
(Yo what's on, come on)
Redman it's the war head; BOOM!
Nigga I don't die, 
I was born dead
Top of the mornin' to ya, I wake up like a born loser
The world is my Bermuda; Triangle and I'm lost in it
I'm hearin' voices saying "Red, the wanna put holes in ya authentic"
I walk among winners and I put out work, nigga
And I don't stop, until I squirt
Haters hate on, you can tell the rest of the class
I can see the evil in you, through a masculine task
Smoke the greenest grass
 I live by the hand of god
That me, ya boys, or ya guns won't leave a scar
You niggas too hard and not ready to scrap
Knowin' damn well, ya moms raised you better than that
Redman the weirdo, I'm my own dirty clique
With 35 KO's nigga 
I'll make it 36!
[Hook 2X]
[Verse 3: Redman]
Thou shall not fuck with raw, 
Funk Docta
Takin' ya breath when I drop ya
I feel for you 
cause cats, try to test me
You a waiteress set of an MC, check please
Been waited way too long
, now it's time to put 
Gilla
 on the map
Gilla on ya back, same Zombies, from Phila on attack
Niggas want it back, Triggas on the map
Won't stop me, I'm not a quitter that's a rap
If I was just broke you wouldn't notice me
Ha, Ha, but look at the bright side my man
Nobody really planned to fail, you really failed the plan
Gotta keep the bomb like an Israeli hand
My music's killa, your's girlie; Scram!
I can hang out in the same place as my fans
Let 'em touch me, feel how far that I swam
Look in my eyes, ya noddin to sleep
It ain't a watch, as Eminem, providin the beat
That's why..
[Hook 4X]

[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
I feel pretty (x3)
And witty
And gay
And I pity any girl who isn't me tonight
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off, bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it, nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch, life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music, so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)
[Hook: Eminem]
I feel ugly (x3)
Slut don't touch me or hug me
I'm mad and I pity any girl who gets with me tonight
[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas, Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
I hear them mumbling, I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
[Verse 3: Eminem]
All you lil' faggots can suck it, no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, it's (high class) meets (white trash)
[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, boys

[Verse 1]
I used to be a lonely man
Only mad
Til I got a million dollars
Shit now if I only had
Some fucking hair I'd pull it faster than a bullet
Out of 2Pac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it
I'm trying to grow it back again
It was an accident
I had my back against the fan
And chopped it off in Amsterdam
I hate this straitjacket
It ain't latching and can't lock it
So they stapled my hand to my pants pockets
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it
Before me and just kept throwing their fucking self at it
My head is aching
I'm dedicated to medication
But this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation
Anyway, I got down with Dre
The first man who taught me how the Glock sounded to spray
Running up and down the street screaming, Fuck the Police
When you still had your mother's fucking nipple stuck in your teeth
Became a role model after Colorado
Now all they do is follow me around and holler bravo
Hell yeah I punch my bitch
And beat my kids in public
Suck my dick bitch
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face
But I won't
Cause you probably wanna stand in his place
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass 2Pac image
You faggots ain't tough
You just get drunk and become talkative
I'm probably the awkwardest alcoholic talking
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket
So when you see me on your block stumbling
Mumbling a bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does
I ain't buzzed, I'm just high on life
So why on earth would I need drugs
When I'm fly on kites
Motherfucker
Slim Shady
I'm drunk, pass the Tec
[Hook x2]
Cause if I get locked up tonight
Then I might not come home tonight
Keep it moving
Off and on, Eminem is on
Off and on, Dr. Dre is on
[Verse 2]
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron
Psych, I'm just joking
For Christ sakes
Don't get so bent out of shape
Cause I went out and raped six girlfriends
Some people just don't get it
But I won't let it upset me
Cause they don't know better
They don't know what the fuck it's like to be so fed up
And fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up
My mind's got a mind of its own
Sometimes I can't find it at home
It hides in the stove
Hello, where you at
Shit, talk about your brain being baked
My shit's still in the oven on 480 degrees
Hailie Jade,
 
Daddy loves you, baby
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter
Fuck you
 lady
You critics wanna criticize but couldn't visualize
Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes
The neighborhood that I grew up in, you could die for nothing
And Dirty Dozen watches over me, so try some dumb shit
I'll have a fucking man raped
With a Band-Aid over his mouth
And shove his head in a fan blade
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say
Or change cause of the age range in my fan base
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit
Quit fucking buying it
I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit
Hip-hop is universal now, it's all commercial now
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now
But now the White kids like it
So they tell me I can buy it
But as soon as I get on the mic
It's like the night gets silent
Either that or booed
, 
that's why I keep an attitude
And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon
I'm sick of being judged
Fuck it, let me see a judge
I'll confess to every murder I committed since three years old
[Hook x2]
[Dr. Dre]
Fuck that, turn that shit off
Let's get the fuck out of here
You know how we do [echo]

[Verse 1: Eminem]

[Intro]
"Life," by Marshall Mathers
What is life?
Life is like a big obstacle put in front of your optical to slow you down
And every time you think you've gotten past it, it's gonna come back around
And tackle you to the damn ground
What are friends?
Friends are people that you think are your friends
But they're really your enemies,
 
with secret identities and disguises
To hide their true colors
So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers
They wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't looking
What is money?
Money is what makes a man act funny
Money is the root of all evil
Money'll make them same friends come back around
Swearing that they was always down
What is life?
I'm tired of life
[Verse 1]
I'm tired of backstabbing ass snakes with friendly grins
I'm tired of committing so many sins
Tired of always giving in when this bottle of Henny wins
Tired of never having any ends
Tired of having skinny friends hooked on crack and Mini Thins
I'm tired of this DJ playing your shit when he spins
Tired of not having a deal
Tired of having to deal with the bullshit without grabbing the steel
Tired of drowning in my sorrow
Tired of having to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo
I'm tired of motherfuckers spraying shit and darting off
I'm tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour
Then this boss wonders why I'm smarting off
I'm tired of being fired every time I fart and cough
Tired of having to work as a gas station clerk
For this jerk breathing down my neck, driving me berserk
I'm tired of using plastic silverware
Tired of working at Builder's Square
Tired of not being a millionaire
[Hook]
But if I had a million dollars
I'd buy a damn brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick
Without a condom on, while I'm on the john
If I had a million bucks
It wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out
Robbing armored trucks
If I had one wish
I would ask for a big enough ass
For the whole world to kiss
[Verse 2]
I'm tired of being white trash,
 
broke and always poor
Tired of taking pop bottles back to the party store
I'm tired of not having a phone
Tired of not having a home to have one in if I did have one on
Tired of not driving a BM
Tired of not working at GM, tired of wanting to be him
Tired of not sleeping without a Tylenol PM
Tired of not performing in a packed coliseum
Tired of not being on tour
Tired of fucking the same blonde whore after work
In the back of a Contour
I'm tired of faking knots with a stack of ones
Having a lack of funds and resorting back to guns
Tired of being stared at
Tired of wearing the same damn Nike Air hat
Tired of stepping in clubs wearing the same pair of Lugz
Tired of people saying they're tired of hearing me rap about drugs
Tired of other rappers who ain't bringing half the skill as me
Saying they wasn't feeling me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"
And I'm tired of radio stations telling fibs
Tired of JLB saying, "where hip-hop lives"
[Hook]
[Outro]
You know what I'm saying?
I'm tired of all of this bullshit
Telling me to be positive
How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see shit positive?
You know what I'm saying?
I rap about shit around me, shit I see
You know what I'm saying? Right now, I'm tired of everything
Tired of all this player-hating that's going on in my own city
Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm saying?
But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm saying?
I'm just fed up, that's my word

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, 
I get it
I run this rap shit
, now 
guess who's back
You thought I left you
, now why would I do that? (1, 2, 3)
[Verse]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West,
 
maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause 
I ain't black
, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because 
I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap
While I'm sittin' back in my office jackin' off to my plaques
I'm still sick,
 
how can I be sick this long
And I'm still alive
, 
Magic Johnson arise
I thrive on makin' my opponents think that I've died
That's when I just pop up outta nowhere, oh yeah, there we go there
Damn I forgot how much money he got
On the beach of St. Tropez, but your man don't lay
In the sun cause I don't tan, I burn
, 
blood clot
When you gonna learn how much money we've earned
How does it feel to know I came in this game at 25
And coulda retired at 29
 
in my 20's still
And Fif' here to lick on that Coca-Cola shit
And he ain't even gotta look at coke to even hold a brick
No more,
 oh boy, 
goddamn did he score
To go from sellin' bags to bottles right out the store
And Shady hit the box office man
, 
he knocked the socks off us
My ex-wife is set for life,
 you 
profitless
 
cocksuckers
So stay the fuck off us, we make pay
I'm just a super easy 
modest
 MC, okay?
Til I hear the word has been, that's when I start spazzin'
Smart asses, kiss a smarter ass then
I'm the best thing that ever happened to rap
,
 bastards
I'm a blonde Dre
, now gimme 
Kanye's glasses!

[Hook: 50 Cent]
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (I, I get it)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah, yeah)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run New York!)
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I took quarter water sold it in bottles for 2 bucks
Coca-Cola came and bought it for billions, what the fuck?
Have a baby by me baby, be a millionaire
I write the check before the baby comes, who the fuck cares?
I'm stanky rich, I'mma die trying to spend this shit
Southsides' up in in this bitch
Yeah, I smell like the vault, I used to sell dope
I did play the block, now I play on boats
In the south of France baby, Saint-Tropez
Get a tan, I'm already black, rich, I'm already that
Gangsta, get a gat, hit a head in a hat
Call that a river rat, shit, fuck the chitter chat
The baker, I bake the bread; the barber, I cut your head
The marksman, I spray the lead, blood clot, chop your leg
Do not fuck with the kid, I get busy with the Sig
I come where you live, ya dig?
[Hook: Eminem]
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
I, I get money, money I got (Yeah)
I, I get money, money I got (I Get It)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (I run this rap shit)
I, I get money, money I got (Now guess who's back)
I, I get money, money I got (You thought I left you)
I, I get money, money I got (Now why would I do that)
Money, money I got, money, money I got (One, Two, Three)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
They keep on sayin' the same rappers are the best
Jay-Z and Kanye West, maybe they're just tryna distract it
From the fact that I'm comin' back
Or maybe it's cause I ain't black, maybe it's because of that
Maybe it's because I'm the highest sellin' artist in rap

[Hook: 50 Cent]
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new though
I got rid of my old bitch, now I got new hoes
First it was the Benzo, now I'm in the Enzo
Ferrari, I'm sorry, I keep blowing up
They call me the cake man, the strawberry shake man
I spray the AR, make your whole clique break dance
Backspin, head spin, flatline, you're dead then
9 shells, Mac-10, "who wanna get it cracking?"
I was young, I couldn't do good, now I can't do bad
I ride, wreck the new Jag, I just buy the new Jag
Now nigga why you mad? Oh, you can't do that?
I'm so forgetful, they calling me cocky
I come up out the jeweler, they calling me Rocky
It's the ice on my neck, man, the wrist and my left hand
Bling like bloaw, you like my style
Ha ha - I'm heading to the bank right now
[Hook: 50 Cent]
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Yeah, I talk the talk, and I walk the walk
Like a Teflon Don, boy, I run New York
When I come outta court, yeah, I pop the cork
I keep it gangsta, I have ya outlined in chalk
In the hood if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya I'm about my bread
Round the world if ya ask about me
They'll tell ya they love the kid
[Outro: 50 Cent]
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (Yeah)
Whoa, hey (I run New York)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (I-I get it)
Whoa, hey (Yeah, yeah)
Whoa, hey (I run New York) whoa
I get money, money I got
(I'm back on the streets, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm bringing the heat, man)
I get money, money I got
(I'm on my grind)
Money I got, money I got
(Like all the time)
I get money, money I got
(Trying to stop my shine)
I get money, money I got
(I'll cock my 9, don't get outta line)
Money I got, money I got
(I said don't get outta line
I-I get it, I-I get it
Yeah, yeah)

[Intro: Hopsin, Nay Nay]
Yo (Tell ‘em how it is Hop)
For all you young rappers out there
Who think about blowin up one day
Just be careful man
This shit ain’t all fun and smiles and giggles and all that shit
(It really isn’t)
It hurts and it’s scary
Shit you can learn from my mistakes
[Hook: Kid Cudi, Hopsin]
I hear them callin me
(I can hear them callin)
Will I answer
(Will they answer, will they answer)
I see them chasin me
(I see them chasin me)
Will I run from them
(Will I run from them, will I run from them)
[Verse 1: Hopsin]
Yo, this rap game is shady
It's trifling what they did it to me
Took away my whole fucking life
And then showed no sympathy
They'll trash you in a blink of an eye for another entity
And I always thought that me and this rap game were meant to be
Every day I sit alone in a dark room
Mad at my fucking career, just hoping it starts soon
So I put these white contacts in that I go berzerk with
Then wile out on rappers who made it that don't deserve it
I needed cash so I signed over my soul to earn it
I'm writing flows dead as I lay in a hole of curses
They promised fame
I ain't spend five minutes on its surface
My life is a bogus circus
I'm trying to hold my purpose
I'm writing the dopest verses inspired and so assertive
But I'm broke as fuck
Washing my laundry with no detergent
They told me "Hopsin your the best MC
The next big thing to blow up from the west indeed”
Shit..
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nay Nay]
To music my life was dedicated
I never hesitated
Givin up my friends for these beats, mics, plus pens and pages
Now each day seems like the worst day ever
I sit and think bout how they say it always gets better
But I don't see it like they do
How come my dreams never came true
And how come every time I walk around I never get waved to
See this industry is shifty
With their deals and it's a pity
Even though I'm spittin gritty
In this city that don't get me
Its like, lookin back at all my work
Was it worth all the effort I put forth
Trying to heal and change the earth
And make some use out of my birth
Or was it all for nothin
Puttin my name out in public
The times I spent writin something
Through the night while wolves were huntin
Yeah these blood thirsty record labels
With contracts stapled on tables
Won't go for one though I'm able
Cause I can't fall for their fables
So Imma do it independent
Imma try until I get it
When I do then Imma spend it
On what I want, I'm through pretendin
[Hook]
[Outro: Nay Nay]
Yeah
So just take warning
The world isn’t always as it seems
Not everybody out there’s good man
Yeah
Nay Nay
Hopsin
Kid Cudi
Yeah

[Hook]
I hear them calling me, will I answer? (Answer) 4x
I see them chasing me, will I run from them? (Run from them) 4x
[Verse 1]
There are demons all around (around)
Monitoring every sound (sound)
Make sure so i do not grin
I do nothing then they win
Seeing me they breaking into my skin (skin)
Time being shit i just flew through my next akin
If i get another rhyme text i swear i take it on the chin
I never had fear, i know i get to your ears and you'll show tears
All you ever did was to hear me when i bust a gore and spray more
Call whenever why should i care fore when i crush a small whore
Now and again there's war that i just gotta crawl above all near me
Over again there's a time i be thinking doesn't anyone hear me
What the fuck have i done for to get this sentence here with me
All of you just jealous wish i was gone but when i drop more
All you motherfuckers fearing me, come on
[Hook]
I hear them calling me, will I answer? (Answer) 4x
I see them chasing me, will I run from them? (Run from them) 4x
[Verse 2]
When i go outside they chasing me, tracing me
Trying to find me, hide me dig keep inside me
Fake homies wanna ride with me i wish they all died from me
Sometimes i just wanna say goodbye and open fire on any nearby
I tried to survive their reply but tonight i must go by and murder 'em
Hereby when i drop by lyrical everyone die and i won't sit and cry
In lyrically I might just be that one criminal spitting them miracles
In the top of your little ear, you'll always hear me spit a syllable
And me hitting up the front row with the fo-fo blasting the po-po
Everyday i'm being invincible i hate it but i keep on killing
Because I'm despicable and my mind kinda wicked, ho
[Hook]
I hear them calling me, will I answer? (Answer) 4x
I see them chasing me, will I run from them? (Run from them) 4x

I Hear Them Calling
KiD CuDi ft. Kody Fowler
[KiD CuDi]
{Chorus} 2x
I hear them calling me, will I answer? (Answer) 4x
I see them chasing me, will I run from them? (Run from them) 4x
[Kody Fowler]
This is really how it is when you start to feel alone
You hear voices, but you're the only person home
Scary how it is in this reality
I can hear them calling me, but there is no way I can see
All the devils that surround me behind the smoke
All of my friends laugh at me, they think I'm a joke
There's no way they could ever know
There's no way I could ever show
The pain I keep locked away
Depression that's here to stay
Self-medicated and I almost overdosed
But that's surely not something that I try to boast
I broke my nose snorting that cocaine
Hoping that it'd take away all my pain
Yes, your friend the KiD almost died
Yes, I believe nobody would've cried
{Chorus} 2x
[Kody Fowler]
There are demons all around
Monitoring every sound
Making sure I do not grin
I do nothing, then they win
Defenseless in my own head
They cause all my bloodshed
Toasting to every tear
I know not what brought them here
Please help, calling from my own mind
Looking for sanity, there's nothing to find
I lost that at eleven years old
Put my father in the ground and made my heart forever cold
{Chorus} 2x

[Hook]
Oh, I just died in your arms tonight
It must've been something you said
I just died in your arms tonight
[Verse 1: Lil' Wayne]
Weezy F matchin with Bird Baby
VRP's, SB's, matchin shirt, maybe
White T, Neck V, glasses are Versace
Married to the mob, but im a bachelor baby
Love is in the air, I put on a Gas Mask
I rather be there first, than the ass last
I'm a Gorilla, call me Sasquach
And I keep my army with me like M.A.S.H
Light up the purp, 
pass it like Steve Nash
Bitch your so hot I give yo ass a heat flash
Young Money boy, I'm on 03' cash
Such a CEO, like my homie D-Dash
Gas... we mash like 
Pac and the outlaws
And we stand-up, and try not to down-fall
Tryin' to reach my goal, like a round-ball
Freddy'll do anything for the crown y'all
I keep on looking for something I can't get
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holding back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dapper Don, Cap' of Queens, mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'mma fucking G?
I'm all automatic when I'm at it, start static and you splattered
Shit shattered, 
I'mma walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it live it always to the limit[x2]
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits you dig it? 
Me I'm from the street[x2]
We ain't nothing sweet[x2]
The home of the homies
There's a body every week[x2]
Now I don't hear the sirens
But they probably gonna creep[x2]
Plotting to pull me over
Plant the in my jeep
So I'll be skipping cities 7 states in a week
For the wolves follow rules
Don't get moved by the two's blood'll ooze on your shoes
Wait Control your hate, you ain't ridin' in them sixes
Cause you spendin all your on them bitches
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
They think they crazy
But they ain't crazy lets face it
Shit basically they just playin sick
They ain't shit they ain't sayin shit
Spray umh 50
A to K 
get in the way
I bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem
You stayin wit me
Don't let me lose you
I'm not tryin to confuse you
When I let lose wit this uzi
And just shoot through you Isuzu
You get the message
Am I gettin through to you
You know what's comin
You motherfuckers don't even know do you
Take some BIG and some PAC
And you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top
What the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers
Tied up in a knot
The Juggernauts of this rap shit
Like it or not
It's like a fight to the top
Just to see who die for the spot
You put your life in this
Nothin like survivng a shot
Y'all know what time it is
Soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats
Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was 80 seconds
Away from the towers
Them cowards fucked with the wrong building
They meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children
It's Nuclear showers theres nothin spookier
You're now about to witness the power
[Hook]

[Future]
Well Jimmy moved in with his mother
Cuz he ain't got no place to go
[Eminem]
And now I'm right back in the gutter
With a garbage bag that's full of clothes
[Future]
Cuz you live at home in a trailer
What the hell you gonna do?
[Eminem]
Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you
Well my names Jimmy, and his name's Greg Buel
And me him and you went to the same school
This ain't cool, I'm in a rage, he tapping my mom
We're almost the same age!
On the microphone I drop bombs
Look at this car, thanks a lot mom!
"Here happy birthday Rabbit
Here's a brand new car, you can have it"
A 1928 delta, this shit won't even get me to the shelter!
And I can't even say I'm from Motown
Cause I'm back in the 8-1-0 now
Cuz I live at home in a trailer
Mom I'm coming home to you

[Intro: Proof]
Yeeaah! This is DJ Seven Deuce,
 
live at
Club Runyan,
 
where all the girls with burgundy hair get in free
G-Unit in the house!
 What up baby
Performing live tonight live on stage... Captain Save-A-Ho
And the fabulous Case y'all, stick 'em out y'all
All my Detroit players, let's go!
[Hook: Kon Artis]
I ain't set the stroke and I ain't for games
I just came to fuck and maybe
 
get some brain
I got a woman at the crib so I ain't your man
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
You know all I really wanna do is fuck
I ain't gon' let a money hungry women set me up
And if you think I'm that stupid you done pressed your luck
I'll be damned, I'll be damned, I'll be damned
[Kon Artis]
You damn right, yes I love menage-a-trois
And I got drawers as big as guys's big "wah"
I'm a Trick Daddy nigga, so bitch how you figure
That I wouldn't turn my niggas on to you when I hit ya
I probably could forget ya if I hadn't been drunk
But your badunkadunk,
 
keep my mind on hump
When my mind's on hump it mean my .9's in the trunk
And Denaun got a line for every fine bitch I hunt
Not once, twice, but three times the lover
That your man is,
 
and I'm a freak undercover
I got plans for you, trick, 
I don't need a baby mother
I got five of them motherfuckers trying to smother me already
We can't go steady, but you can give me head
Give me that, get the hell out my bed, and leave the shed
My chapped lips will cut nipples when breast fed
And on the way, leave the bread with Achmed
I'd love for you to stay but I got another date
With a fat chick that eat cake on playskates
She rubbed my funky ass feet and feed me grapes
Plus my man in the closet ran out of videotape
[Hook]
[Swift]
I'mma make this one thing clear
Ain't no woman here gon' ruin my career
All the hell you doing is pursuing a dream
That's when you find out that life ain't truly what it seems
All these hoes be lying, bullshitting each other
And why the hell Kobe Bryant didn't wear a rubber?
He might as well have went and told the ho that he love her
I'm sure as hell ain't gonna go to court for my mother
Or my wife, and my sisters, so motherfuck a mistress
They signing a contract before these bitches hit this
Never will a woman take me out that way
I keep a RCA camera in their motherfucking face
[Hook]
[Bizarre]
What's your name again? It doesn't matter
My name is Bizzy, a bodyguard for
 
Mr. Mathers
Sit down girl, let me get you a drink
I'mma buy you a mink,
 
and rape you on the sink
From day one, I knew you was a ho
I put a rubber on my toe and fucked you some mo'
Turn around, let me see your nasty ass
Put on a Jason mask while I take off your maxi pad
[Kuniva]
These hoes be on some bullshit, always trying to pull shit
Outta they ass, get mad and put you on blast
Tell 'em bitches how she fucked you, sucked you, put it on you
Boned you, yapping off with they mouth, saying she loved you
All on your dick, calling your phone, spazzing and shit
Having a fit until you feel like calling it quits
Then she starts calling your chick wanting to fight
Every time you show up at a gig she front row with her friends
Flipping you off follow you to the bar, the bathroom
The parking lot, to the car, pissing you off
Until you blackout, now you and the ho is having
 a scrap out
You get locked up for assault 
and now you assed out
[Hook]

[Intro: Busta Rhymes] (Eminem)
Yeah! Guess who it is!
Aiyyo Dre! I think they in trouble!
 (WOO!!!)
Scott Storch!
 
Why you have to do it like this 
to them?!
Feels like a new day
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes] (Eminem)
Listen, now every time I come and I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit
 
you ain't never even gotta question who
Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin zoo
Then I come and I spit c-crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panic and freakin get schizophrenic and let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test
 
my crew
Take a second check it I wreckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded that's why ya shit is through
 
(WOO!!!)
You fuckin idiot I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't blind and if you ain't handicapped in your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo
You do not have a fightin chance to move you you were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do
G-g-g-goobers are glued to you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
You're probably wonderin why there's thunder
 
and everyone
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block
Cause Bus a Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
 then
With Shady quietly tryin not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we all been spotted, we might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody come on lets get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet put somethin on and get to the club
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas you bunch of bumblin fools
Who got me rumblin dudes all way down the block
Keep on stumblin and jumblin over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin out of time see I'm tired of all y'all
M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin n-n-nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your cd player and turn up the volume
You bang your head because your shit is not
I - 
continue with crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin while I got you tr-tr-tremblin
For one of my niggas bust ya head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brotha bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbin and fuck her then tell you bitch to get off my yacht
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]

I need Christopher Reeves to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on Medicine Ball
First off
, 
I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Whoa, I'm on a roll, don't get me started
Ellen
 got pissed at me tried to push me and pussy farted
With such accuracy he aims and he shoots the target
Cupid's arrow
 and Portia ??? now look, sweetheart it's
The kissin' bandit on a mission to leave
, Miss 
Degeneres
Disenchanted by men
 now just listen damn it
Miss De Rossi, I need no posse,
 now 
single-hand it
Lee
 
will steal your heart with a kiss
Where should I plant it?
 
Mm-wha! Baby, it's *moi*
And my repertoire's runnin' around in pink panties and leopard bra
And negligar, negligee, you say tomayto I say TOMato
I’m Tommy Mottola 
Mariah
 don`t stop me I`m on a roll, ohh
Y'all know what it is

[Hook]
That's why they call me Slim Shady
(I'm back)
I'm back
(I'm back)
I'm back
(Slim Shady)
[Verse 1]
I murder a rhyme one word at a time
You never heard of a mind as perverted as mine
You better, get rid of that nine, it ain't gonna help
What good's it gonna do against a man that strangles himself
I'm waiting for hell, like hell, shit I'm anxious as hell
Manson,
 
you're safe in that cell, be thankful it's jail
I used to be my mommy's little angel at twelve
Thirteen I was putting shells in a gauge on a shelf
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block
Til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox
I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less
What do I think of suc-cess
It sucks, too much press I'm stressed
Too much cess, depressed, too upset
It's just too much mess,
 
I guess I must just blew up quick (yes)
Grew up quick (no)
 
was raised right
Whatever you say is wrong, whatever I say is right
You think of my name now whenever you say, "Hi"
Became a commodity because I'm W-H-I-
-T-E,
 
cause MTV was so friendly to me
Can't wait 'til Kim sees me
Now is it worth it, look at my life, how is it perfect
Read my lips bitch, what my mouth isn't working
You hear this finger, oh it's upside down
Here, let me turn this motherfucker up right now
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it
Just to see if he's influenced by me, if he listens to music
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim
And becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe
{*vocal scratches*} My name is Slim Shady
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me
The sensational
 
{*vocal scratch "Back is the incredible!"*}
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible
It's Ken Kaniff on the internet
Tryin' to, lure your kids with him into bed
It's a sick world we live in these days
"Slim for pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs"
Geez, you guys are so sensitive
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"
Mind with no sense in it, fried schizophrenic
Whose eyes get so squinted,
 
I'm blind from smokin 'em
With my windows tinted, with nine limos rented
Doin lines of coke in 'em,
 
with a bunch of guys hopping out
All high and indo scented
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
I take seven [kids] from [Columbine], stand 'em all in line
Add an AK-47, a revolver, a nine
A MAC-11 and it oughta solve the problem of mine
And that's a whole school of bullies shot up all at one time
Cause (I'mmmm) Shady, they call me as crazy
As the world was over this whole Y2K thing
And by the way, N'Sync why do they sing
Am I the only one who realizes they stink
Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things
Cause all these fans screaming is making my ears ring (AHHH)
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger
Longer than the rumor that I was sticking it to Christina
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz
It'd be Jennifer Lopez and Puffy you know this
I'm sorry Puff but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother
I still fuck her with no rubber and cum inside her
And have a son and a new brother at the same time
And just say that it ain't mine, what's my name
[Hook]
[Eminem {*vocal scratching*}]
Guess who's b-back, back
Gue-gue-guess who's back 
(hi mom)
{*scratch*} Guess who's back
{*scratch*} Gue {*scratch*} guess who's back
D-12
 {*scratch*} Guess who's back
Gue, gue-gue-gue, guess who's back
Dr. Dre
 {*scratch*} Guess who's back
Back back {*scratch*} back

[Verse 1]
My hoodrat's fatal, they not stable
I could be at a dinner table
With 'Union Gabrielle', fine as hell, pierce in the naval
Look at my rat like she act brand new
"Hey boo, how are you?"
Yeah, cool, now tally-o your ass back across the room
You see me with Pocahontas
I ain't tryin to be honorary but honestly I ain't tryin be bothered
You got a brain, define honors in college
You'd rather define how your knowledge in chronic
I'm tryin step my game up a notch bitch
Your aim to cock block on my plot bitch
She hot and your not, so stop bitch
Quit blowin up my motherfuckin spot, shit
[Hook]
How could you be here? Why don't you leave here
I ain't tryin to see you everytime at my show
I got a piece here, you ain't gotta speak there
You know how we get down on the low
Your playin me cheap here
Tonight I don't drink beer
I got a bottle, so it's time for you to go
You's the freak here, you don't know me here
She's a model, you my late night ho
[Verse 2]
They chase me (Obie, Obie), when they see me in the club
With a lot alike Stacey Dash, they gettin mad
Then they wanna brag and say "already had 'em
He ain't shit cause he rap for Mr. Mathers (girl)
Plus 50 Cent's like ten times badder (girl)
D-12 shouldn't of had him on they album" (girl)
That's what I get just for stabbin them hoes
They nag, when I pose with a chick with nice toes
Ya'll knew O before for new hoes, but since it's a new ho
Just act like you never knew O, boo
We still crew, we just the same (uh huh)
Just not tonight, you don't know my name (you don't know me)
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Hey yo fellas, never get timid when the chicken is interferin
When your chillin with a chick, who a ten (damn)
Let her know the situation at hand (uh huh)
And tell the bitch go play with her friends (BITCH)
This is for the model that your chillin with, hoodrats is often awful
My advice keep your mouth on muffle
Feistiness give 'em the right to snuff you, and you too pretty to scuffle
This is for the rats, go on with that (go on)
Quit actin like you smokin that crack
Cause he pokin that chick, you ain't ownin on shit
Ain't no rings on that finger
And every nigga in the hood ain't triple teamed her
[Hook]
[Obie Trice - talking]
That's right, ha, you see me at the club
With a, with a look-alike Halle motherfucker
Look alike, look a, look alike Alicia Keys
Haha, you don't know me
Don't say shit, you know who I'm talking to
All my hoodrat bitches
Neneh, Aqua and Trip Entanetta
Haha, all ya'll
I'm straight, Obie Trice

[Narrator]
Torture chambers, secret passageways, vats of acid, and deadly vaults
[Intro]
I said, ohh
Damn, it feels good to be back
I'm having a 
Relapse
[Eminem]
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?
He's already got life in jail man, what the hell is his problem?
Well to be honest, 
the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic
They've
 compelled me to kill this elderly man
And I get these panic attacks, 
pop a Xanax, relax
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass
Then I get manic depressed
, 
see the orthodontist, get gassed
Man, it's kick ass, the first thing I put on is the 
mask
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you? Well, thank you, 
Jason
There goes one more 
coma, due to blunt force trauma
Just give me one more Soma
 and 
I'll be done for mama
Go in the damn broom closet,
 another 
Valium
, lost it
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet
It seems like everyday I get a little flakier
The medication is making my hands a little shakier
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up
It'll only take me a second to choke his 
trachea
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places
 baby, here Shady comes, lady
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums
Yeah, here I come-come, you hear the rumbling vrumm-vrumm?
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum, drum
A head and torso of someone, where'd it come from?
Who's it belong to?
 
Maybe the girl with the long, blonde
Hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms
Clearly there's somethin' wrong, cause she didn't come home
She's missing, 
where is she
? Something 
fishy
 is going on
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song, come on

[Verse 1: Eminem]
My music is soothing but it's also been proven
That it can put you in the mood to jump out your car while it's moving
You been waiting on this moment, my sermon is like a omen
I'm serving, I'm Erick Sermon, I saw the window was open and I jumped through it
My shit if you don't get pumped to it
I quit, here's my rhyme book, go ahead and thumb through it
And pick what you want from it, rummage and find something
You can use to jump someone and roll up bumping
I'm constantly copping over you, squatting, shit has gotten
To the point where I ain't even writing no more, I'm just jotting
This is chicken scratch, shit is sickening, I've been kicking ass
Off bullshit throwaway rhymes, pick a batch
I live for the love of rap, you crazy
I've made beats for Jay-Z for free
Page me, you need a beat, you Canibus?
Then it's Dre's fee, if you Kay Slay, the fees waved
I stay beefing with JD, 'til the day Dre 2-ways me
That it's okay to stop blazing him
Oops! I put it out, I apologize now
It's too late G, it's on tape and the tape leaked
Say What You Say,
 motherfucka
Drama King, Kay Slay,
 motherfucka
We dictate these mixtapes motherfucka
Xzibit, blaze this little gay midget cocksucker

[Produced by Bass Brothers]
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Who came through with two Glocks to terrorize your borough? (huh?)
Told you how to slap dips and
 
murder your girl? (I did!)
Gave you all the finger
 
and told you to sit and twirl
Sold a billion tapes and still screamed, "Fuck the world!"
(Slim Shady...)
 
so come and kill me while my name's hot
And shoot me twenty-five times in the same spot (Ow!)
I think I got a generation brainwashed
To pop pills
 and 
 til they brains rot (uhh-oh)
Stop they blood flow until they veins clot
I need a pain shot, and a shot of plain scotch
Purple haze and acid raindrops
Spike the punch at the party
 and drink 
pop
 (gulp gulp)
Shaved my armpits and wore a tank top
Bad Boy, I told you that I can't stop
You gotta make em fear you 'fore you make em feel you
So everybody buy my shit or I'mma come and kill you
[Hook]
I got mushrooms, I got acid, I got tabs and aspirin tablets
I'm your brother when you need, some new weed to set you free
You know me, I'm your friend, when you need a Mini Thin
(I'm Slim Shady...)
 
I'm Shady!
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful (uh-huh huh)
I like birds, bees, I like people
I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful (hehehe)
Like when my teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool
 (Woo!)
The ill type, I stab myself with a steel spike
While I blow my brain out, just to see what it feels like
Cause this is how I am in real life (mm-hmm)
I don't want to just die a normal death
, 
I wanna be killed twice
 (uh-huh)
How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat
When they high off of drugs they haven't even done yet (Huh?)
So bring the money by tonight - cause your wife
Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (Help me! Help me!)
I try to keep it positive and play it cool
Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay in school (Stay in school!)
Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to better
Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a fuck you letter
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yo.. I listen to your demo tape and act like I don't like it
(Aww that shit is wack!)
Six months later you hear your lyrics on my shit
(What?? That's my shit!)
People don't buy shit no more they just dub it
That's why I'm still broke and had the number one club hit
 (Yup, uh huh)
But they love it when you make your business public
So fuck it, I've got herpes while we on the subject (uh-huh)
And if I told you I had AIDS y'all would play it
Cause you stupid motherfuckers think I'm playin when I say it
Well, I do take pills, don't do speed
Don't do crack (uh-uhh) don't do coke, I do smoke weed (uh-huh)
Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer (yup)
I just wanna make a few things clear
My baby mama's not dead (uh-uhh) she's still alive and bitchin (yup)
And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin'
It's not syphilis, and as for being AIDS infested
I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested
[Hook]
And that's my name!

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Lil' Tyrone tired of gettin his ass whipped, so he holdin that gat down
His momma think it's my fault, cause he listened to "Back Down"
Bobby was a fucking bum, he pumpin' backs now
He need some fresh chicks, white T's and fitted hats now
Uncle Rock a wino, he won't put the yak down
Eric had the jump shot, but he's smokin' crack now
The Lunatics, the Lost Boyz, Cheeks shit is whack now
Country blew trial, them crackers got him on his back now
And Sean runnin' round with his fucking gat now
Up in niggas cribs, sayin' "where that money at pal?"
Now Sandra from BK I seen her out in Houston
That bitch travelled the world, she runnin' round boosting
Now Toya got these bad-ass kids, they a nuisance
Her baby daddies never come around, they useless
Every now and then I come through on some new shit
Pearly white 6 or some chrome deuce-deuces
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I'm so hood - I can't help it
I'm so hood - I can't help it
Love me for bein me - cause I can't change it
Can't rearrange it, I am what I am
So love me for bein me
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
When I was six man, momma told me God don't like ugly
I fell, scraped my face, and thought God must don't love me
Saw Owen every mornin before school, he sell dope
Niggas keep whuppin' Nut ass cause he sell soap
Charlie be beggin all the time, he stay broke
Flip be down on 1-0-9, rollin up smoke
Shameek, he a thief, catch a stunt in a stolen car
He that nigga that you call when you crashin into a bar
See they love me cause I rap now, but they don't like me
I been locked up three times and they ain't write
Stevie a punk, but fuck what he say, he can get mean quick
Pop shots at you, Esau must suck a mean dick
The block's hot, D's jump out on us almost all the time
They watch us from the buildin but niggas still be on the grind
Wayne used to call the cops and tell them G had a 9
'Til G put that gun in Donrad seat and said it wasn't mine
[Hook]

[Intro]
Ah-ha man! Ay you know where them niggas be at right?
Take me to 'em
[Hook]
All through the hood I keep hearin niggas sayin'
I'm supposed to die tonight
Niggas done put a hit out and they talkin like the shit okay
I'm down to ride tonight
We rollin, whip stolen, AK loaded
I'm down to ride tonight
Weed smokin, straight loc'n, lockin loadin
Somebody gon' die tonight
[Verse 1]
This is nothin' new, I been in this position before
Grandma crib, niggas outside of her door
Different day same shit
, 
old mac new clip
32 hollow-tips, gloves, no rubber grip
I'm a boss, but niggas never show no respect
I catch 'em slippin', I'll have 'em tongue kissin' my tec
Go on, come, test me, pussy boy, don't try it
Police response never fast enough to shots fired
Don't be stupid, find out who you fuckin with son
'Fore we find out where yo' bitch get her hair and nails done
It's elementary, life is but a dream
You know row row your boat, your blood forms a stream
After you get hit, you shoulda thought about the shit
You took that paper you take a life or yo' life get took bitch
Sometimes I sit and look at life from a different angle
Don't know if I'm God's child or I'm Satan's angel
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
In 2002, if you asked me to make a wish
I simply woulda wished that my music would be a hit
Big said, "Damn - niggas wanna stick me for my paper"
"And pray for my downfall," I understand it all
But 
me,
 I'm a little more flashy a nigga
So chances are, I'mma have to blast me a nigga
I'm on that Kevlar and vest shit, that Wild Wild West shit
There's eighty-one one carat stones in my necklace
I shine so hard, I make motherfuckers wan' kill me
Every projects in every hood I go, they feel me
Know it sounds like rap, but this shit is real B
I don't talk that rich shit, but nigga I'm filthy
When I come out to play, and my mob ain't with me
You can bet your bottom dollar that revolver with me
Homeboy, frontin on me'll shorten your lifespan
Hold the mic with my left, my knife in my right hand
YEAH!
[Hook]

[Hook: Skylar Grey]
I'm about to lose my mind
You’ve been gone for so long,
 
I’m runnin' outta time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor to bring me back to life
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
But I don’t even know if I believe it when I’m sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in,
 
every day it's just so grey and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for ‘em, they just say it's wack, but they don’t know what dope is
And I don’t know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me,
 
I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son,
 
demons fighting you, it’s dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me,
 
not the slightest clue
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon either wanna fight me when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me,
 
but I'm outta options, there's nothin' else I can do cause
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
It hurts when I see you struggle,
 
you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I’m puzzled,
 
cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don’t believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I’m your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are
It was YOU, who believed in me when everyone was tellin'
You don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
, 
Dre, I’m cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up Dre I'm dyin', I need you, come back for fuck’s sake
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death,
 
but where the fuck are they now?
Now that I need them, I don't see none of them
All I see is Slim, fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers, when the chips were down you just laughed at us
Now you bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets
 and 
ask us where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack
, maggots
And the crackers' ass
, 
little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers
, 
I'm back bastards
One more CD and then I’m packin' up my bags and as I’m leavin'
I’ll guarantee they scream, "Dre, don’t leave us like that man!" cause
[Hook]

[Intro]
Ah yeah
This is Eminem, baby
Back up in that motherfucking ass
One time for your motherfucking mind
We represent the 313, you know what I’m saying?
They don’t shit about this, for the ‘96
[Verse 1]
Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxin', the zany-actin' maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely wack with just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with spray that disinfects 'em
Twisting necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
Put this in decks and check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution, contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hits a snare and bass on a track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be staring gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland
[Hook]
I'm Infinite,
 
you heard of hell? Well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murdering instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it but when I hear the beat
I'm tempted to make another attempt at it,
 
I'm Infinite
[Verse 2]
Bust it
I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense in your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and then two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coiled hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator intimidator, stimulator, simulator of data, eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My a capella releases classic masterpieces
 
through telekinesis
It eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be infinite
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Man I got evidence, I'm never dense and I've been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MCs
Mic nestler, slam it like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, my skill is intergalactical
I get cynical, act a fool, then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tactful track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
So this is for my family, the kid who had a cameo
On my last jam plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be,
 
cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit
 
and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit
[Hook]

Eminem- "Infinite" Front Cover

Eminem- "Infinite" Back Cover

[Verse 1]
Niggas screw they face up at me
On some real shit son they don't want beef
I cock that, aim that shit out the window and spray
There ain't a shell left in my heat
Y'all niggas better lay down, yeah, I mean stay down
You get hit with AK round, your ass ain't gon' make it
You niggas will get laid out, your blood and your brains out
Have you on the concrete shivering and shaking
I'm from Southside motherfucker
, where them gats explode
If you feel like you're on fire, boy drop and roll
Niggas will eat your ass up, cause they heart turned cold
Now you can be a victim or you can lock and load
The party jump, shorty bouncin that ass, I wanna fuck
Gimme a second I'mma holla, I'mma see whassup
I got my razor in my hand, got my pistol in the trunk
Carve your ass up nice you play me like a punk
[Hook]
In my hood - niggas got love for me
But I don't go nowhere without my strap
In my hood - a little 'dro, a little Hennessy
And niggas just don't know how to act
In my hood - niggas is grimey
I stay on point, I roll with my gat
In my hood - niggas might buck at me
So I keep something around to buck back
In my hood
[Verse 2]
I don't trust a muh'fuckin soul
When the D's come they fold, on my first case they told
Where I'm from it ain't safe to have more than a eighth
Niggas'll come to your place, put a gun in your face
Tell you open the safe, as your heart start to race
Cause a robbery could turn into a homo' case
Co-operate, or Doc'll have to operate
Niggas I'll pop you, run a light then pop at Jake
Trust me son, niggas'll go hard for that cake
These thirsty niggas are lurking, you'll have to catch 'em and merk 'em
I'm observing in my hood, cause niggas be dumbing
Shots forfeit the dice game
, all you see is the running
They make it harder and harder to pump on the block
I'm a hustler, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to eat when it's hot?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The house party off the hook until them shots go off
Well that's what you get for stuntin on my block showoff
You shit out of luck if niggas catch you slippin
Crack money slow so you know niggas is trippin
Shorty down there on that Queens tracks takin a whippin
Sheeit, bitch get out of pocket, she need some discipline
Peep the fiend shootin diesel in his arm in the alley
Look at the chrome spinner spinnin on that black Denali
The grimey niggas where I'm from don't wanna see you chipped up
You shy nigga on jux, you about to shoot your whip up
It ain't good to do good in my hood
{*click-clack, BLAM*} You know not to do good now
[Hook]

[Eminem]
I was born with a dick in my brain, yeah fucked in the head
My stepfather said that I sucked in the bed
'Til one night he snucked in and said
"We're goin out back, I want my dick sucked in the shed"
Can we just play with Teddy Ruxpin instead?
"After I fuck you in the butt, get some head
Bust a nut, get some rest"
The next day, my mother said
"I don't know what the fuck's UP with this kid!
The bastard won't even eat nothing, he's fed
He just hung himself in the bedroom, he's dead!"
"Debbie
, 
don't let that fucker get you upset
Go in there, stick a fuckin cigarette to his neck
I bet you he's fakin it, I bet you
I bet he probably just wants to see how upset you would get
I'll go handle this, of course, unless you object"
"Aw, go fuck his brains out if any's left in his head"
[Hook]
If you count the skeletons in my closet
Under my bed and up under my faucet
Then you would know I completely lost it
Is he nuts? -- NO, he's insane!
[Eminem]
(Did you get him?)
 
Naw, fucker tried to bite my face off
I just got fuckin chased off with a chainsaw
Then he took the chainsaw, bit the fuckin' blades off
Ate the blades
, 
stuck the baseball in the slingshot
Then the aimed at his own face, let the thing pop
Took his eye out, picked it up and played ping-pong
Then he played ping-pong with his own ding-dong
That motherfucker's got nuts like King Kong
Then he set the lawnmower out on the dang lawn
And he laid all up underneath it with the thing on
Then he took his pants and took every fuckin' thing off
Everything 'cept his tanktop and his training bra
Ain't he raw? Yeah, maniac, that Shady dawg
Man, that motherfucker's gangsta, ain't he, dawg?
Shady dawg, what be goin through that fuckin brain of yours?
Say no more, what the fuck you waitin' for? Sing along
[Hook]
[Eminem]
Don't you know what felch means? (Yeah!) Well, then tell me
Would you rather get felched or do the felching?
Fuck 'em in the ass, suck the cum out while you belchin' {*burps*}
Burp, belch, then go back for a second helping
Could you dig what I'm sayin, man? Could you smell me?
I want you to feel me like my stepfather felt me
 
(uhmm...)
Fuck a little puppy, kick the puppy while he's yelpin
(Shady, what the fuck you saying?) I don't know - HELP ME!
What the fuck's happening?! I think I'm fucking MELLLTING!
"Marshall, I just love you boy, I care about your well-being"
NO, dad! I said NO! I don't need no help peeing
I'm a big boy, I can do it by myself, see?
I only get naked when the babysitter tells me
She showed me her a movie like "Nightmare on Elm Street"
But it was X, and they called it "Pubic Hair on Chelsea"
"Well, this is called 'Ass Rape' and we're shooting the jail scene"
[Hook]

[Hook: Swifty McVay]
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
(I'm an instigator) Nigga, can't you see?
(I'm an instigator) Ain't nobody worse than me
(I'm an instigator) I'll be the first to beef
First to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe. Fuck with me
[Verse 1: Kuniva]
I love getting shit started.
 
I instigate a peace talk
Into a beef talk until police need chalk
To chalk you up. Have bitches walking up
Smacking you in your face; screaming that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Ran his pockets and stuck him
'Til they gather in front of your crib, guns and long clips
Laughing when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies that's so believable
You'll run and grab your shotguns, Glocks and nines
Walking blind; excite fights until they erupt
Instigate my own death cause killing you ain't enough
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I don't give a fuck if we beefing or not: I'll squeeze first
I'mma heat up your spot;
 I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets every day, snatching nigga's yay
How you bitches needing work, you can get it from McVay
I'm just spiteful. I tie a ho; a maniacal foul animal
Liable to leave you strapped with your bible
I'm psycho; my bullets won't fly by you
You wanna kill me? You got the right to
Ain't gotta wait 'til night to snipe you: if I don't like you
You getting hit in broad daylight with a white rifle
In front of your window: I'm looking right through
I love when I see a nigga get stuck
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
(I'm an instigator) Drama tends to follow me, I know
I probably owe all of my friends apologies
Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me
Get a lobotomy; nigga, this one's to my arteries
Guns are a part of me: I pack more than pottery
I ought'a be jailed for depicted mockery
Egg on fights to plot on the niggas that shot at me
I don't twist the truth I just make it Gothic, see
I'm nothing but a liar with a big-ass mouth
Dick and fists big enough to knock your bitch-ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you, I rap with him but I don't like Proof
[Verse 4: Proof]
Nigga, fuck you
. Me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you
(I'm an instigator) Convince a tenth-grader
To run up inside his classroom and leave the kids *screaming*
Bitch, straight-up. This is the season
For squeezing off triggers on niggas for no reason
Either jump or quit running your mouth
Pull a gun out, better use it 'til the bullets run out
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Swifty McVay]
I throw a brick at your crib, have you standing on the porch Screaming "Look what you did!" I ain't feeling no remorse
Nigga, just pick up the kids. Swift got first dibs
With these cherry-hot slugs that'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparing deathbeds. Quick to bust lead
While I'm staring at the Feds, tearing off they legs
Once you drop dead, they'll be swearing it's a plague
I'm sicker than a coke Rastafarian with dreads
You get shanked if you move; ditched with no clues
Dopest shit on yo' tape was yo' skits and interludes
And once I finish you, they wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts, so you hoes ain't got the guts to interview
[Hook]

LINKIN PARK AND EMINEM - IN THE END REMIX -
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Fuck it
Dre, just let it run
It starts with...
Hey yo, turn the beat up a little bit
Hey yo, this song is for anyone...
Fuck it
Shut up and listen
Hey yo, When this first started off
It was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle
Came Motion Man
And at the end of it all
It was Kutmasta Kurt
With a remix
[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
That echo of the clock rhythm's in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
And I watched the time go right out the window
Tried to grab hold
Tried not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
[Hook]
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
[Verse 3: Motion Man]
Hey yo, One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialized
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shacked, and made eye-contact
Partied and toasted strong, all that
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No opportunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up to weaken your system
I had you throwing up
I brought you back into things
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
You'd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt like loving, never played real
I'm bringing the pleasure
By any means it means I'm leaving your team
Hell of a team, man it seems I tried so hard
[Hook]
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
[Verse 4: All]
Linkin Park
Remix
Motion Man
Linkin Park
In the end
Kutmasta Kurt
Linkin Park
Remix
Motion Man
Linkin Park
In the end
Kutmasta Kurt
Remix
[Verse 5: Mike Shinoda]
One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall, and I hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run with you mocking me, stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chock-full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard
[Hook]
I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter -In The End-

[Intro: Yelawolf & Eminem]
(In this world, in this world!)
Yeah, aight Marshall, uh
(Well, I'm think you can tell 'em today)
Who am I? (Yelawolf)
(And now you need to bring 'em into this world!)
[Hook]
It’s getting hard to be me
Every where I go, somebody’s looking at me
And If I ever need something, I’mma get it for myself
Cause I’m the only person thinking ‘bout me
It’s getting hard to be me
Everywhere I go, somebody’s looking at me
And if you gon’ compare me at all best compare me to myself
Cause I’m the only person fucking with me!
[Verse 1]
In this world of sticks, hicks and chicks with aqua net spray
Shhh-shut up motherfucker don’t disrespect these country ways, yeah!
Alabama, if yeen know, I ain’t hiding a damn thing, I just like to lean low
Yeah, I’m the theme show stereotypical beanpole
Slim, tall, tatted, let me add that I gotta green glow
From all the Mountain Dew that I consume from a mason jar
In a racing car, chase it with a tall ice brew
Let me not leave you confused, what I represent culturally
Trash bag full of freon,
 I’m huffin’ puffin’ on potpourri
That gummo’s squeaky swingin’ gate in front of that trap house
Trailer park is sewed up and Billy done pulled that ac out
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Wonder what I got inside this Chevrolet Trunk I’m hiding
About ten Bodies on a fishing line with baby clothes on consignment
Came to the Game so broke that I still find one-dollar bills and get a thrill
That’s the kind of shit that leaves my pickle dill'd
Siding on the single-wide got icicle steel, too cold
Got a kerosene heater to heat up the grill, meatloaf?
Daddy’s in jail again for shuffling pills, we know
Man I’ve only come to give you a peep show
, (In this world)
I run across the South Like a wild stream, smiling
I’ve seen more colorful mushrooms than a child’s dream on an island
Desolate left behind, cause my state is a state of grime
God said, 1979, go change the minds (In this world)
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Yelawolf, 
Hi my name is
President O' Bama, I’m so shameless
I’m taking it all, so what am I saying?
I’m the voice of every small town (In this world)
Like a light in the pipe, with a mic
And take flight in this life, I'm a sight
Put a vice-grip lock on my right to fight
Despite the way you may feel about sights and sounds
That I might put down, about prices found on a sack of that white
Heaven is a place in a 7/11, I can never get away from hell
Found hell in the bible-belt, and found love in a 6-pack on the shelf
Went to the seashore to see more, but Leroy didn’t seem sure to me
So I took Leroy to Alabama, he bought the hat and bought the tee
Converted him y’all, I gave him convertible thoughts
When he saw that big buck hangin’ on the wall (Yeah)
I’m off by a millimeter, I’m on by a million light-years and 2 liters
A pint of moonshine, I ride in two-seaters
Take a ride (In this world)
[Hook]

[Intro]
The Invasion! (Invasion yeah)
Green Lantern! the infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)
[Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice!
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!
[Verse: Eminem]
Whoa, here we go, I shoulda' known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then I'm a flip
, 
then I'm a get to
"Stomping in my Air Force Ones"
But you won't be able to tell
If it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a 
woody
 when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the {*Eminem vocal scratch*}
Wit a pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy
[Hook: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50,
 Shady records
We the label fa' sho!
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records
We gon' kill your label fa' sho!
[Eminem]
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months
 {*gun cocked*}
[Outro]
Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
Cause we do and we see y'all
We just gon' sit back for a minute
While I see what the FUCK y'all do

[Intro: Eminem & Obie Trice]
Kay Slay! (Yeah) Yo..
Drama King! (Yeah!)
Check it out, check it out, O. Trice!
(Shady Records nigga, it's going down once again, boy)
It's just a scratch, man (Let's go, Em)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I Murder this Inc as soon as I touch the page
You ain't gon' have no other choice but to rush the stage
And charge the mic, and I hope you got the heart to fight
Cause you gon' have to
, 
cause you ain't got the smarts to write
Something that good, to try to come back at me with
What you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?
You motherfuckers crack me up, talking bout you gonna smack me up
Yall won't even back me up
Throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard
It's like fucking cats de-clawed trying to jack me off
You think I'm afraid? What you trying to throw some fear in me?
You think I'm dumb enough to roll with no security?
I'm doing my best to try to show maturity
But don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me
Like it's supposed to be scaring me
Like I won't leap clean over this fucking
V.I.P. rope and throw this chair
At anyone close or near me, trying to approach me physically
Cause he don't spit lyrically
And he knows that my flow's so sick
, 
his ho's on my dick
And he's so sick of hearing me, my posters are staring at him
But I don't think he knows the severity
Of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously
If I go hysterically, cause I guarantee
There's no one in here that would resort back childhood
Any quicker than I would, or hit you with plywood
Especially when I'm sipping on this liquor and tonic
One swig of this bottle I'mma go upside your head so hard with it
The mark from it'll be so dark that it'll leave a scar so big
You'll be able to read a label from the motherfucking
Sticker that's on it, I'm sick of the nonsense
Shit is ridiculous and I refuse to let it get to this point
Where I'mma let you sit on my conscience, I'm gone, bitch (YEAH!)
[Hook: Obie Trice]
I'm gone bitch
Shady Records motherfucker, we gone, bitch
I said we gone bitch, so long, bitch
Catch up if you can, we moving on, bitch
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
Now who you know been to Kyoto, Tokyo
Off of one debut, screaming, "I'm in Janai yo!"?
Obie Trice, showed you right
He done seen overseas, he's not a prototype (nah)
Nobody's protégé, Em only showed O. the way
Fuck what the media say
If you listen to music then you should know that O. Trice fused it
In a matter where he speaks how the streets views it
Choose, to translate it through the art of music
And started using it reaching the youth
Influenced by the truth in it (truth!)
And as a boy, a man, I ran from boys in vans
Do the knowledge, acknowledge and try to comprehend
Hand full of contraband
A product of my environment, narcotics and violence
Inspires the content, but my intent is
To retire these tired-ass writers in si-lence (yeah!)
Cause haters they hate us cause Shady became famous
And claimed the rap game when they thought he'd be nameless (hah!)
But racist accusations won't change us
Let the truth be told, you think O. will be over here
Like, "Master, show them you got soul!"
No, anybody knows us knows that's not how we roll
So, I still push the bucket
If I ain't trust it I wouldn't fuck with it
But fuck it, I'm gone bitch!

[Intro]
Your mother.. you fuckin' faggot
Ayo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of Erik Shrody
Rest in peace, we ain't forget about you, you fuckin' homo, we still remember
[Verse 1]
There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singin the blues like there no tomorrow
Left his boys in the 
House of Pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those that act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do
[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years, how it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago, 
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more
[Verse 2]
I remember back when you had the Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughin when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing you could ever do
Was try to buck a 380 on those who act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Remember back in '94, like right before Ms. Everlast was Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was outta fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard "The Knack"
And you were down with Syndicate, I went to get your shit, man I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit,
 how could you diss me, bitch?
I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhymin, then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothin'?
Like you was mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or somethin
I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin to steal your light or nothin
But you're a homosexual, 
white rappin Irish (Muslim)
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a *Muslim* too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you? 
I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what, are you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fuckin' sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So everytime I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues
[Hook]
[Outro]
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy fuck
And by the way, a 
380's a fuckin' sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin' real gun, you little bitch
Next time say my fuckin' name in a song,
 
don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin' diss me, diss me you fuckin' faggot
You fuckin' punk pussy, you fuckin' little bitch, fuckin' cunt

[Eminem]
It has been said, 
that there has been known to be bloodshed
Over bread
, 
men who have bled to death, dead
Strapped to beds
, 
pipe bombs, dynamite, lead
Money, power, respect, street cred
, yeah
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself going out as a hero
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners
Notorious tried to warn us
We watched, so many piggybacked off of
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap
Statistically in fact; 
it's so sad to see us re-enact
These tragic events, which lead us back
To where we left off on March 9th
To come from such hard knock lives
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights
And, once they're on us this is our lives
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us
To see who can last the longest
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starving
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies
And applies to his persona or the sizes
In his entou-rage, that intimidates the people
To the point that you know that he's gangster
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it
[Obie Trice]
Since B.I.G. taught us niggas to think big
I'm been about my business since then, so anxious
It ain't how we live, it's what he said, he did it for Brooklyn
This I took in, sent chills through my skin
Vicious, I'm experiencing the same sights as him
It's what excited Obie to write these poems
Rolling, going through the same shit he spoken
Open up my eyes so there's no limit in them skies
When Ready to Die was a sick part of my life
Palming that forty-five, plotting to pop my mind
Then that crooked eye Jamaican I'd so many times rewind
Got me to walk a straight line and get up on my grind
Get up out the system, who could give him better signs
No pop of mine could top Big Poppa rhymes
So possibly I'd be popular, huh?
That's the inspiration I got from my nigga B.I
[Diddy]
I took him from coal to diamond, 
I molded his mind
Enter the most phenomenal artist of any and all time
I made a Frankenstein
, 
my design impressed
Backpackers and press who said my house was a mess
Critics lashed, said I made a fortune off of his passing
All I did was build a dynasty, off of his passion
And 
I'm addressing the adolescents absent to who he is
The original king of New York, Christopher Wallace
This is a promise on Diddy's honor, I'm a father T'Yanna
And teach her that with all the drama don't even bother
On repeat, all of your albums play back to back
And 
I visit your grave cause our friendship's intact
An immaculate concept, extravagant progress
Bullet wounds left in my heart, I'm yelling "God bless"
Regardless to critics yelling that East/West
I seen the game losing, I'm just pressing the reset
And when 
the resurrection of you shines through an individual
Lyrical enough to wear the same crown of thorns
 literally
I'mma pay homage, Brooklyn's finest
Whether it's Queens or Harlem it'll be instant stardom, nigga (nigga)

[Hook]
Thanks it's been real
I love you but I just can't deal
With the stress this game is giving me...
But before I go
You know
I can't close the show
Without no closure
So before I leave...
[Eminem talking]
Yeah
I just want to take the time out
To basically say
Rest In Peace
To Deshaun Holton
That's my heart man
Dr. Dre
For giving me the opportunity
Just to even listen to me
To get me to this point
I wanna thank Jimmy Iovine
Interscope,
 
Aftermath
Everybody in the whole Shady staff
Everybody whose basically supported me from day one
Paul Rosenburg
, 
Tracy McNew
You know I love you guys
I couldn't do it all without you
D12
Ca$his
, your gonna be a beast when you get out there man
Trust me homie, my ears don't lie to me
Who else am I forgetting
Oh yeah, 
Obie Trice
Bobby Creekwater,
 and basically man
The whole city of Detroit
8 mile road for making what I am today
Which basically goes back to Proof & D12
I love you guys man
Runyon Ave for holding me down when shit got thick
Oh, it wouldn't be complete, If I didn't
Thank my mom, bitch
So
[Hook (Fading)]

[Intro]
[Proof] Check it out
[Eminem] Hey Kyu!
[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
It's a broke day but everything is okay
I'm up all night, but everything is alright
It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep
It's a long year pretending I belong here
[Verse 1: Eminem]
One day I plan to be a family man, happily married
I wanna grow to be so old that I have to be carried
Til I'm glad to be buried and leave this crazy world
And have at least a half a million for my baby girl
It may be early to be planning this stuff
Cause I'm still struggling hard to be the man, and it's tough
Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough
I've been taken advantage of, damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffed
But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff
Or plan to give up,
 
the minute shit hits the fan, it erupts
I'm anteing up, double or nothing,
 
I've been troubled enough
And I'm sick of struggling and suffering, see
My destiny's to rest at ease, 'til I'm impressed and pleased
With my progress, I won't settle for less than cheese
I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call
Way before my baby is able to crawl
I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates
To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
I seen the golden gates to heaven on Earth
Where they don't pull a weapon on you when you stepping on turf,
 
Kyu
[Hook: Eye-Kyu]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm going for broke, gambling and playing for keeps
Every day in the streets, scrambling and paying for cheep
Praying for sleep, dreaming with a watering mouth
Wishing for a better life for my daughter and spouse
In this slaughtering house, caught up in bouts with the root of all evil
I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful
And make them do shit illegal for these Grant's and Jackson's
These transactions explain a man's actions
But in the mist of this insanity, I found my Christianity
Through God and there's a wish he granted me
He showed me how to cope with the stress
And hope for the best, instead of mope and depressed
Always groping a mess, of flying over the nest
To selling dope with the rest, 
I quit smoking cess to open my chest
Life is stressful inside this cesspool
Tryna wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel
My little brother's tryna learn his mathematics
He's asthmatic, running home from school away from crack addicts
Kids attract static
, 
children with automatics
Taking target practice on teens for Starter Jackets
I'm using smarter tactics to overcome this slum
I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum
It's cumbersome, I'm tryna do well on this Earth
But it's been Hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth
[Hook: Eye-Kyu]

It's only fair to warn
I was born with a set of horns
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord
Warlord of rap
 
that'll bash you with a 2 by 4 board
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella
To chop a fella to Mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller
Got you locked in a cellar
With your skeleton showing
Developing anorexia while I'm standing next to ya
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death
With an IV in your vein feeding you liquid Darvocet
Pumping you full of drugs
Pull the plugs on the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs
Who were picked up in an ambulance and driven
To Receiving with the asses ripped out of they pants
And given a less than 20 percent chance of living
Have a possible placement as a hospital patient
Storing the dead bodies in Grandma's little basement
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp
And pulling your Adam's apple out through your mouth
Better call the fire department
I've hired an arson to set fire to carpet
And burn up your entire apartment

Call me baby, baby
{She say}
Call me baby, baby
{She say}
Call me baby, baby
{She say}
Call me baby, baby
{She say}
[Chorus: Brick & Lace}
I just want you in my arms Obie
Hold you till the morning Obie
Know you got it going on Obie
I don't hear what the rumbleclots say {She say}
I just want you in my arms Obie
Hold you till the morning Obie
Know you got it going on Obie
Sex and on that good love to me
[1st Verse]
She say she like em dark skinn-ded
Not timid, wanna rumble in my loft is it
Talk different
, 
her walk's exscusite
Switch is ridiculous,
 
locks is twisted
Like a block she said visit us
Jamrock
 
why don't you picture us, with
Kids or whip, a ton of cannabis
So I can can it on a cannoe
Sippin coconuts like its a can of some brew
I'm what she plan to hold on to {she say}
[Hook]
[2nd verse]
Haters wanna hate, hey no way, hey
She'll slit ya throat, mess around with O
She move a pound of coke, like brown with hopes
Of being close to folk, if you clown ya poked
No joke, murder she wrote, provoke me no a rotty
Be a dead body, it be that dread hotty
Me no know noone that more potty
Down on her knees, up in the party to please my body [she say]
[Hook]
I just want you in my arms Obie
Hold you till the morning Obie
Know you got it going on Obie
I don't hear what them rumbleclots say {She say}
I just want you in my arms
Till the break of dawn we can get it on Obie
Ain't no need to prolong Obie
Realest nigga on this song is Obie
[3rd verse]
Way she move, got me in her hypnotic ways
Her voice manuevers, got me thinking bout her day to day
See I'm faced with beauty, there's nothing more for me to say
Put on the dance floor and play with Obie
And it's no cliche, O's great like the lake
So she pon'd the river her way of doing the snake
Jamaican God, make a true playa break
Say it ain't so, ya truth is fate
Incense lit when she's interested in insertion
Any minute ya squirting, she gifted in
Giving you the business, hurting em
Plus she know that art of perversion {she say}
[Hook]
Call me baby, baby x12
[Talking fades out]

[Hook: Sample]
Jealous
! (8X)
[
Woman's voice: (Talking over the singing)
]
Jealous!?! What he mean jealous, know what I'm saying?
He just mad cause he all with them ugly hoes, know what I'm saying?
Girls don't buy him no clothes. He bought that ho some clothes!!
He don't buy me no clothes. That nigga ain't got no money, no vibe, no dick
I mean, what do I got to be jealous fo'?
He ain't gonna make it nowhere. He ain't got no type of time
He has no career move, I mean...
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I come home every single day from working double shifts
And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts
I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me
Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously
Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me
It must be only just because you never learned to trust me
Plus we only squabble over only irrelevant issues
Too many tissues, for my feelings you misuse
I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me
I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things
So what's a man to do when all I hand to you is handed back to me
You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me
I used to love your company, now you’re always pumpin' me
For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me
So I'mma wait for your evacuation
Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in
See I've never been so sure, and you're just insecure
So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure
I recommend you take your things and check them in
Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?
[Hook: Sample]
[Woman's Voice: (Talking over singing)]
Fuck you and what you going through
Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man
Me and Eminem don't need nothing but minus money
Immature, me? 
Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang
Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night
Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about
Motherfucker just trying to get his pussy
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments
I used to be intoxicated with your sweet scents
Until the day I started following your feetprints
And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents
It made complete sense, there's someone else you like
So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike?
And you was like, (sampled) **I need a new nigga**
Someone rich that I could follow
And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow
Leaving me in sorrow
, 
Brandy never felt so brokenhearted
I fell apart when you departed then the joking started
I was an open target
, 
you play comedian
And I became the laughing stock.
 
but now I'm on my feet again
And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife
All in my sex life,
 
I got a message from Phife
He goes, "You didn't want me to see yo hon, don't want me now
Take the towel, wipe your brow,"
 quit trying to hunt me down
You run me down and now your trying to 
apologize
For all the lies and everytime you made me ball my eyes
Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it
Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it...
[Hook: Sample]

[50 Cent]
Maaaaan!
Let's go
[Eminem]
Hey yo Fif'
[50 Cent]
Yeah?
[Eminem]
Call 'em and tell 'em
It's time to hate us again
We're back
[50 Cent

Beautiful day without drama is rare
Your girl's a freak man sometimes we share

Running, winding, donning and shining you know what I'm saying

They wanna talk shit let them talk shit cuz they talk shit
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it
Cuz no one wants to walk around stepping in dog shit
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they wash it
But the pride won't let 'em inside they like go get 'em
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um
Shady Limited's in any size yo denim to velour
Even our clothing lines on fire
As 50 would said our clothing lines on fiya !
Meanwhile your mind's on us like mine's on Mariah
And you all just like her you're all fucking liars
But I'll just keep fucking you like I fucked her
Right in the ass with K-Y yessir
So full of joy boy am I absurd
Even Chingy would tell you yeah boy don't curr
[Hook: Eminem]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH
Can we get more of those they like OH YEAH

So Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos I'm like OH YEAH
See me ride up close, you're like OH 'EM
And where's D12 at they like WE OVER HERE
And where the fuck we goin' we're like NOWHERE
[Verse 3: Ca$his]
(Ca$his!)
Watch Jimmy get cracked to the floor with a round
Spun around and hit the ground
You the new James Brown
New king of Mo-Town
Side with folk while
You not a G you a joke and they all know now
I don't brag about the way that I lived in the past
I just pray I get away after whoppin' your ass
From now on don't speak namin' your reps
I'll hop out yo' pussies restin' on blech
But I told you Ca$his consecutively sweet life off the beat all you hear is me
I'm A B.B.G plus a B.G.D Bring it on anytime you wanna come see me
Stay alive lil' guy you don't want it with me
And your man Fifty put your money on me
King Mathers made me to blow up
Re-Up, I'll crush that you know Cash up Shady!
[Hook: Eminem]
See us on the award shows and we're like OH YEAH
Can we get more of those they like OH YEAH

So Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care
See me in the videos, I'm like OH YEAH
See me ride up close, you're like OH 'EM
And where's D12 at, they like WE OVER HERE
And where the fuck we goin', we're like NOWHERE

[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
Hey, we ain’t really gotta keep going through this
If anybody wanna rap circles 'round you, my nigga, we 'bout to do it
You about that bitch, dough, and that swag, that’s it
Let me talk about us, we about that bitch, dough and that swag
We about that sitting on that ave
And because we sitting on that ave
We about that pistol in that bag
We about that fist fight, only after we grab a fist full of that cash
We about that get right
, 
what you have perceived the least but not last
We are the sickest scribbling with that pen, that pencil and that pad
And y'all talking this and that, so what
My click can wrap my dough up
Now picture that, I write the sloppiest verses down you seen
I hand it in for green
So I can buy all of my bitches bags with the stacks
And call the cash chicken scratch
Slaughter baby we just getting warm
Y'all ain't fucking nothing we can't fuck
Y'all ain't driving nothing we can't drive
If we can't afford it we just take yours
See ya'll little niggas just misinformed
Shady blew up, took the game, turn around
And ten years later he gave it to the
[Hook x2: Eminem]
Juggernauts of this rap shit (7x)
Like it or not
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
Some of you niggas is bitches too, you rocking panties, huh
Sit down when you pissing too, you niggas trannies, huh
What you stand for is beneath me, you understand me, huh
Niggas get X'd like the professor and juggernauts running our family, huh
Homie I was making checks before that Martin Margiela
And niggas was rocking Avirex
, 
now hot rappers date my ex-s
And I'm still rated X, stick my dick so far in a bitch's throat
It'll come out the other side and turn a blowjob into anal sex
Ain’t no next, cause I got now until I decide to to bow, avow your style
It ain’t gonna mean a thang cause I came to bring the pain like Tical
Nigga, now, we're the juggernauts to this rap shit
Bust a shot with ya ratchet
When suckas dropping that whack shit
[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
Ask them hood niggas if I hug the block
Ask these broads if I slide on that glove and uppercut that box
Man I come from the roughest so if I come up in the spot
And you bugging I’m tellin you suckas watch, I’m a take off that fucking watch
And scratch a, bitch, I'll be on a nigga ear, scream Juggernaut
He hot, that don’t mean that he nice, y'all get that confused a lot
2Pac
, 
I don’t sacrifice what I write for the newest drop
Big Pop
, 
us big boys still clean down to the socks
Then sprinkle a little Big L on top
I’m what the fuck you got,
 
put Porter rock
With a pen and Eminem as a friend I’m touching this Entenmanns
That’s cake
, 
you little boys don’t get it so listen let’s make amends
We don’t wanna be bullies, y’all wanna get beat up
So lift your knees up and start running
Or put your knees down on the ground and bow cause we the
[Hook x2]
[Verse 4: Joe Budden]
Look, it's House Gang
 
on that shady street
Chill, 
y'all already know the address
Where the eulogy's said, so they assuming he's dead
Before that body hit that bag yet
Be face to face with them slugs
Sad cause my goons ain’t load that mag yet
In the bottom of the ocean floating
They hoping they gon find your ass with that drag net (nah)
(Blat, blat, blat) You're listening to a juggernaut
She just gon' sit by the pool 'til one nigga decide if I’m ready to fuck or not
Rap is contingent on everything other than rap
,
 so no we ain’t discussed a lot
It's sad when they wasting your passion
Not do it for cash when they tell me they up the pot
Nigga you would too, if you knew, what this game would do to you
Been in this since 2002, look at all the bullshit I've been through
So-called beef with nobody's
, 
I mention them and they nobody's
They say they killers, got no bodies
, 
I’m sober talkin on no molly's
It’s Joe probably won’t throw not one bottle in the club
Honestly, 
it's worthless killing the purpose of these hollows in these gloves
And really I’m having a much better time on the couch with these models on my nuts
The minute we raid is the minute you’ll see us show these cock-a-roaches love (waddup)
[Outro: Joe Budden]
What on Earth will the Fuck Boys do next?
That’s right
Same shit they been doing
Getting fucked

[Intro: Frogg]
Get your hands in the air and get to clappin em
And like, back and forth because
This is what you thought it wasn't
It be the brothers representing the Dirty Dozen
I be the F-R-O the double G
And check out my man
He goes by the name of um, er
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Slim Shady
 
brain dead like Jim Brady
I'm an M-80
, 
you Lil' like that Kim lady
I'm buzzin'
Dirty Dozen,
 
naughty rotten rhymer
Cursin' at you playas' worse than Marty Schottenheimer
You wacker than the motherfucker you bit your style from
You ain't gonna sell two copies if you press a double album
Admit it, fuck it
While we coming out in the open
I'm doing acid, crack, smack, coke and smoking dope then
My name is Marshall Mathers, I'm an alcoholic
I have a disease and they don't know what to call it
Better hide your wallet
Cause I'm coming up quick to strip your cash
Bought a ticket to your concert
Just to come and whip your ass
Bitch, I'm coming out swinging
So fast it'll make your eyes spin
You getting knocked the fuck out like Mike Tyson
The proof is in the pudding
Just ask DeShaun Holton
I'll slit your motherfucking throat worse than Ron Goldman
[Hook]
So when you see me on your block with two Glocks
Screaming, "fuck the world" like 2Pac
I just don't give a fuck
Talking that shit behind my back, dirty macking
Telling your boys that I'm on crack
I just don't give a fuck
So put my tape back on the rack
Go run and tell your friends my shit is wack
I just don't give a fuck
But see me on the street and duck
Cause you gon' get stuck, stole and snuffed
I just don't give a fuck
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm Nicer than Pete but I'm on a Serch to crush a Miilkbone
I'm Everlast-ing, I melt Vanilla Ice like silicone
I'm ill enough to just straight up diss you for no reason
I'm colder than snow season when it's 20 below freezing
Flavor with no seasoning
This is the sneak preview
I'll diss your magazine and still won't get a weak review
I'll make your freak leave you
Smell the Folgers crystals
This is a lyrical combat
Gentlemen hold your pistols
But I form like Voltron and blast you with my shoulder missiles
Slim Shady, Eminem was the old initials (bye bye!)
Extortion,
 
snorting,
 
supporting abortion
Pathological liar
Blowing shit out of proportion
The looniest, zaniest, spontaneous, sporadic
Impulsive thinker
Compulsive drinker, addict
Half animal, half man
Dumping your dead body inside of a fucking trash can
With more holes than an afghan
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Somebody let me out this limousine
I'm a caged demon
On stage screaming like Rage Against the Machine
I'm convinced I'm a fiend
Shooting up while this record is spinning
Clinically brain dead
I don't need a second opinion
Fuck dropping the jewel
I'm flipping the sacred treasure
I'll bite your motherfucking style just to make it fresher
I can't take the pressure
I'm sick of bitches
Sick of nagging bosses bitching while I'm washing dishes
In school I never said much, too busy having a headrush
Doing too much rush had my face flushed like red blush
Then I went to Jim Beam
That's when my face grayed
Went to gym in 8th grade, depar the women's swim team
Don't take me for a joke
I'm no comedian
Too many mental problems got me snorting coke and smoking weed again
I'm going up over the curb
Driving on the median
Finally made it home but I don't got the key to get in
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
Shit, fuck everybody
Outsidaz, Pace Won, Young Zee
Fuck the entire world

[Intro: Eminem]
Daddy?
[Hook: Kids] (4X)
I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, yes I do
[Verse 1: Bizarre]
You don't wanna be just like your daddy
Pimpin' hoes out here drivin' Caddies
Runnin' 'round town, fuckin' with skeezers
Shots in your ass, catchin' diseases
Son, your daddy got a foul mouth
From fuckin' bitches in they foul mouths
I can't help it, my group's D12
All we do is pop pills and stay in jail
Talkin' nasty shit, Bizarre won't stop
I'll fuck two twins, with a midget on top
A sick mind, rapin' an old lady
Knowin' damn well Bizarre shouldn't have a baby
All I can teach you, learn how to mac
Smoke crack, smack a bitch when she talk back
Matter fact, smack your sister, she's a slut
Don't you realize Bizarre don't give a fuck
[Hook] (4X)
[Verse 2]
Don't go to school, become a Catholic priest
Sell crack to your Auntie Denise
If Auntie Denise is short forty cent
Make her get on the ground and {suck} your small {dick}
Nas is gon' probably hate me
When Mos Def hear this he probably gon' suffocate me
Why they let Bizarre rap
 
on Hi-Tek
 
track?
All he gon' do is talk about hoes and smoking crack
If your wife is pregnant I call her a whore
Leave her no money and go out on tour
Nah, I'm playing leave her something
I pack a hot dog and a fucking dirty muffin
You're my son, I'm trying to teach you somethin'
You're {eight} years old? It's time to start fuckin'
You know daddy won't give you the wrong advice
Smoke weed and listen to Obie Trice
[Hook] (8X)
[Outro]
All I can tell you how to do is pop pills and stay high
And tell a bitch to suck a dick
I'm a parent, yeah
A motherfuckin' 
role model
Hi-Tek

[Intro]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time
[Verse 1]
Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusations
Ah ah ah ah ah
, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung-hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot," it's ok
(fart sound) Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip
[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah) oh baby, baby (ah ah)
[Verse 2]
It's Friday and it's my day
Just to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday
I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I get there someone's gonna (touch my body)
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out (yeah)
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
(Man you must be up out yo mind)
Dre (ah ah) beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind
 (now I'm)
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady" (touch my body)
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It gets real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's "8 Mile" now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality,
 
look! there's B. Rabbit
"Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man!"
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here
 so, chubby
Tellytubby
 
fellas (what) fellas (what)
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm calling all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go (ah ah ah ah)
It's so appeasin'
[Hook]

Ready to hold it steady....Speakin of hold it steady
You can hold my nuts steady and then

[Proof]

Emzy
[Eminem]
Speakin of lift off
I'm blastin off...your ass is soft...so I'm startin to jack off
Cuz I'm so horny...and your lyrics are so corny
That they bore me and I woke up too late this morning
Or too early...wait a minute there goes Shirley
The girly I fucked last year when her hair was curly
Couldn't remember it cuz I was 
Infinite
And I met Ken Kaniff in Connecticut
He said his predicates and pronouns and wanted to throw down
And he said “I like you”
...and then he walked up and said “Let me snake bite you”
And I said hell no...kicked him with my shell toe
Gave him a elbow...
Ayo Proof ...go
[Proof]
Yo it's the D to the 1 - 2
What you wanna get done to
Your chest plate...eradicate
Get your flesh ate...easily done..Here it is
Freestyle...no need to write shit...

Y'all like to buy shit
...that why street light up when we write stuff
It's time to be the champions at this...it's D-12
1-2 True crew...Slim Shady and Big Proof
Knockin over igloos in Alaska when we blast ya
A massacre creator, one time for data
Darker than Vader
...go anybody hot as the Equator
It's time to get down one time for those that dont know us
Girls wanna blow us like 
Monica....Lewinsky
Come against me
[Eminem]
Go and see I'm an invincible MC
If you dont believe it then you wanna try to convince me
That you're doper than me...which we'll hope
You would hope to be....but hopefully I will rock globaly
And nationwide...
thats why my ass is wide
Thats why your ass just died on the passenger side
Like a fuckin ride...when it got shot up by a drive-by
When I drove by 5 times and gave it five tries
And still missed it
I got a fuckin' mental illness a gentle stillness
Violence...complete silence is what I need in the room while I freestyle
What I need is to do...what is need is smoke weed and brew
And......smoke brew ? You don't smoke brew
If you do I'll choke you and then I guarantee I'll out smoke you
You're crew's a joke too and I can stick my dick in a bitch and poke you
[Proof]
Stick it in there....rock with my cock on sky rock
Knock ya eye out the 
sock

So don't get in the way cuz we gon drop....(shit)
Now how you feel right now we bust yo..op....(tic)....(tock)

The dirty dozen is non-stop
To the top from tree tops to ewoks that pop Reeboks
And men with pre-ops
Yo now there is 3-Pac's
Master P....
Thug Life and now it's 2pac
Get back to that one...here goes the rhyme that you dropped
[Eminem]
The rhyme that I dropped is stickin up 
IHOP
In high tops and walking around like a one-eyed Cyclops
And you can't see me....
I only got one eye and I can still see you
You can even give it a dumb try...If you're a dumb guy then come try this
But I rock the microphone with my flyness
So get off my jock..get of my cock..when I sky rock ...it in sky
Rock..shit...bitch
[Proof]
Ayo...a lot of people always try to tell us...that we gonna be better or failures
But me or Slim yo you can't tell me
You try to freestyle son we gon' put these verses on your LP
Slow down with that old stuff....I heard the most of y'all is 
Mos Def
[Eminem]
My LP...my whole LP...tha last one was screaming help me
You couldn't melt me if you was Vanilla Ice...Yo guess what
My Nuuuuuuuuutz!!
Here I go with the lyrical miracle...spiritual spirital...you dont wanna hear it though
I rickety rock the microphone
Don't do it dont do it cuz that shit is stupid...I knew it
I take a beat and loop it...I take a beat and troop it
What the fuck did that mean...I dont know but I got phat jeans on
And I already said that but I dont know where my head's at
All I wanna do is go back to the hotel and know where my bed's at
[Proof]
Yo wheres the beds at so we can relax and catch Ease
Y'all dont want none of tha 
dirty Deez

Y'all get broke up...put back together ...re-enactment
Some times you see this...you just a faggot
No need to tag it...
wit more loot that Jimmy Swagart
[Eminem]
Faggot....uh oh...was that homophobic...?
But no one knows it...and I'm so homophobic
I won't even throw clothes in the closet
Fuck it...I've lost it....I'm holocausted...see my face it's written all
Acrossed it
This beer
 makes me wanna disappear this year
I'm so high I'm 'bout to die
...and I'm so tired I'm 'bout to fry
You're so fired you're down
[Proof]
Hey....it's me...it's the hamster man
Coming all the way from Amsterdam
And I come to tell you all a little secret
So you can ........eat it ....you got to grab your crackers
{mumbling}
[Eminem]
Quit spittin your writ shit bitch I'll kill you and kick you
In your motherfuckin' dick and your clit...you little pussy
Hermaphrodite with no appetite
And you ain't rappin' right but you was taking rapid bites
Of my dick when you was on it...my brain is haunted
I walk up in a place in a T-shirt wit my stains on it
But I dont give a damn...give a fuck...give a shit...give a hell
Give a piss give a dick give a lick
[Proof]
Yea....live and direct it's us

You better back up before I jack off

You better back off before he jack off (laughing)
You better back off before I jack off
[Eminem]
Colder than Jack Frost...smack you across your face
While I'm still jackin off
Sittin' in the closet beatin' my shit
Ain't got nuttin' else to do cuz I'm thinkin' of a bitch
Wait a minute ...oh shit she's here
Look who walked in the door....come in it's 
Britney Spears!!

(Ken Kaniff)
Oh....come here little girl
Come here little girl
[Eminem]
What happened? (I dunno)
We stopped rappin' (Oh it's clappin')
Gun clappin' 
...and all I need is one napkin to wipe the cum off
When I come off with the drum off
Whatever the hell that meant...but I can still speak wit' a accent
A French accent
Excuse my French but
Suck my dick touche le le poo...uhh....bitch

Bonjour...I'm here with the cure...Oh yea lets rock it for the drawer
Hey Em...how you doin this is me...The Em jock...get off my
Damn cock
[Eminem]
Yo while you're spraying verbs...you ain't even fuckin' saying words
(THuuuG) Pronounce your words right...and you can ride around curbs
And bounce your herbs tight
What the fuck ? (Yo somethin' is in the beat that keeps talkin')
Yo put another beat on before you get peed on
[Proof]
Yo are we done or what? They want us to freestyle for 45 min—
[Eminem]
Hi...Hi.... My name is ...my name is...my name is
Slim Shady...Slim Shady...
Bitch you're little just like that Kim lady
And I'm in sky rock radio...the shadiest bro on the radio
But you dont hear me though

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keepin' it raw,
 
illegal like Maleek and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law, like I'm Steven Seagal
Flippin' off the police while I'm leapin' a wall
Take some Tylenol, then fall asleep in a mall
I got ya little son, you'll be receivin' a call
You lucky this little punks still breathin' at all
Fuck the world, this how I get even at y'all
Pop shit, get rolled up and leave in a ball
I hit you in your mouth and sink ya teeth in ya jaws
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a
 
malt
This lethal assault, is givin' you a reason to stall
I'm cockin' this
 
deuce deuce
 
and I'm squeezin' it off
At the first burp, fart sniffle a sneeze and a cough
Get your arm chewed off like you was teasin' a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and unthaw
I'll kick my girl out, in 10 degrees in her bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
I'm shittin' on rappers
, 
(Where's Shady?)
 
he's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw

[50 Cent]
Ay yo, what’s up, yo this is 50 cent
You’re here with mah man Green Lantern
And you know how the fuck it go down
You wanna hate? Okay, it’s okay, You can hate me baby!

[Hook: Eminem]
Bitch, keep talking
Keep on popping off with them jaws because we ain't stopping
We ain't got to prove shit to yall
So all yall can lick the balls and keep walking
Keep on popping that shit you're popping
Cause we ain't stopping, cause you ain't stopping us
We ain't got to prove shit to yall
So all yall can lick the balls and keep walking
[Verse 1: Kuniva]
Yo, (Kuniva!) the derelict's back
I'm blazing niggas while they up in the Sheraton last
I even sold my therapist crack
You niggas is bitch, straight up, I'm bearing the facts
I love pussy wit all my heart but Im married to gats
And nigga I'm top pedigree so don't play wit me
I
'll blow your tattoos all over your baby seat
Kids and all be hit
Peers and all mausberg will take your back, liver ribs and all
Kuniva the street talker, heat sparker the beef starter
Packing guns when I'm sleep walking
(Bitch, keep talking)
Throwing fire bombs down your chimney
While you eating at Wendy's
I'm in your bushes cocking the semi
Nice with the hands
Never bow down to another man
I was popping guns while you was still popping some rubber bands
Smother your clan
Sever your hands and your legs
Mail your brother your heart and send your mother your head
[Verse 2: Swift]
I'm the only one your bitch let touch her
Type of brother that will fuck your mother
With a fishnet rubber
A belligerent and rowdy motherfucker
That'll dump your body and still fly away to Maui on Atella
When it comes to beefing, it ain't no explaining
I'll change your language with a stainless
I'm contained with an anguish to leave you famous
I'm a deranged pit you all lift an AK to pinch your face with
Niggas don't say shit, fuck your hype man
If it's a bystander standing by I'm fire in at your, cause I can
You get squashed like pop cans
I be shooting 7 up in your mouth, man
I'm about to sell your mama bud and lace it
So when she fires it up she's coughing blood
I love to see 'em wasted
I'm made to behave in this case
You try to be brave in this rage and your legs will be replaced
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Bizarre]
(Bizzy, come on!) 
I ain't here to talk about Benzino or Ja Rule
I'm here to talk about little Ray Ray and what I'mma do
Psyche, I ain't gonna mention it, he'd probably sue
Next week, this shit'll be out on DJ Clue (Exclusive)
The first time I had sex... a dirty mattress
No condom... my grandmother... bent over backwards
Bizarre been fucking raw all summer
Lets make a trade, my wife for your brother
Psyche, I'm not bisexual
I'm an intellectual, transsexual, with one testicle (one nut!)
And I ain't saying shit just cause it rhyme
I got colon cancer
I'm dying
[Verse 4: Proof]
YAY! YAY!
Rest in peace Jam Master Jay
2Pac
And Notorious BIG
I'm probably the best
God in the flesh
Blow your heart out your chest
And your chest out your vest
Leave your body a mess streets bloody as hell
Study my trail I cut and me fail
A druggy on bail nutty as well
Which such like Buddy Revel
Dead or in jail
Still heading for hell
The ghetto rebels the wrong guy
Now get your lungs heart you full of wholes like sponge bob
We can set this from your front door to your CEO office
Got the key to your coffin
To pee on you often
Great me wit offers we taken over
Or get China white mixed wit baking soda
Your hear me
Get CRACKED!
[Outro: Eminem]
Fucking crack heads
And this is just mix tape shit you fucking morons
This ain't brains over brawns
This is bullies over fucking pussies
Ha ha, come on
[Hook]

[Eminem]Hahahahahaha

Your mother, you fucking faggot
La da da, da da da, da da (repeated)
Aiyo, this next song is dedicated to the memory of 
Erik Schrody
Rest in peace
, we ain't forget about you, you fucking homo
We still remember
There once was a man who liked to jump around
But he got too old to jump up and down
So he put the mic down and picked the guitar up
Started singing the blues like there no tomorrow
Left his boys in the house of pain
It was the wisest decision he ever made
But the dumbest thing he could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those who act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do
[Hook]
Cause I remember all those years
How it was when you were here
I remember how it was, how it was when you were young
Yesterday was so long ago
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit
 came along now
Don't nobody wanna hear 
your old ass
 sing no more
I remember back when you had 
The Knack
And I remember when you had your first heart attack
I was right there laughing when I heard the news
I just wish the cardiac woulda murdered you
Maybe Ice-T's right, you are a bitch
You come around when you're broke and you leave when you're rich
But the dumbest thing that you could ever do
Was try to buck a .380 on those who act shady
Tell me now what you gonna do
[Hook]
Yo (yo) yo (yo) yo (yo)
Remember back in '94, like right before 
Ms. Everlast
 was 
Whitey Ford
Before his heart attack had him on life support
When House of Pain was out of fame like someone doused the flame
And they became destined to never jump around again
Or even further back, when I first had heard The Knack
And you were down with Syndicate
, I went to get your shit, man, I was into it
But then you went and took your style and switched the shit
Now you sound ridiculous, you dickless piece of shit
How could you dis me, bitch?
I liked you,
 
thought you was alright for a white dude
Remember 
Sway and Tech
 when I came up and sat beside you
Started rhyming, 
then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nothing?
Like you mad that someone else was white and tried to rhyme or something
I'm sorry man, I wasn't trying to steal your light or nothing
But you're a homosexual, white rapping Irish 
[...]
Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a 
[...]
 too
Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do
What's up with you?
I never fucked with you, why would you fuck with me?
Knowing I could rap circles around you, what, you as nuts as me?
Plus I can sing better than you and I don't fucking sing
And probably play guitar better, and I ain't never touched a string
But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you
I'm what you used to be, shit you was me in '92
So every time I write a lyric, I'mma think of you
And maybe that will help me know what it's like to sing the blues
[Hook]x2
You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin faggot, sissy, fuck
And by the way, 
a .380's a fuckin sissy gun
If you're gonna shoot somebody use a fuckin real gun
You little bitch
Next time say my fuckin name in a song
Don't be subliminal about it
You wanna fuckin diss me, diss me you fuckin faggot
You fuckin punk, pussy, you fuckin little bitch, fuckin cunt

[Scarface sample]
I told you, don't fuck with me
Stupid fuck, look at you now
Yeah, ha ha, have you noticed like
When niggas go to the club, it's always
It's one knucklehead nigga always mean mugging and shit
Heh, he wanna, he wanna have contact with me
Have contact with men, all these bitches in here
Faggot ass, these for them hard head niggas man
[1st verse]
Now I don't wanna come across as a boss some type of mafia
But these are my thoughts, they awful, I won't argue with ya
But see, I got a cause a clause, that I live by
Keep the heater close because I don't want to die
You see I'm from Detroit where they dump 'em off in coffins
And often there's assorted men where bullets holes departed him
And I don't want no parts of them, crazy complications
So I keep the heater cocked up in case of confrontation
And I would just be fakin if I said I wouldn't erase him
If he blatantly, tried to take away God's creation
[Hook]
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Running up on me, may he, rest in peace once released
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Yeah, look at ya now, for running ya mouth, ya stretched on the ground
I'll kill me a muthafucka
Ain't no way you can stop it, on that hot shit, we can get it popping
I'll kill me a muthafucka
{I told you, don't fuck with me, stupid fuck, running ya mouth}
[2nd verse]
Now I'm riding through the city in a Range with no tints
Just to show these muthafuckas yes I am a resident
I ain't stack up my pennies just to move out the city
So if you got a problem with me you should know where to get me
Niggas kills me, portraying that thug
My nigga, you's a crack baby, go smoke on some drugs
Before that hot piece of slug make you where you ain't budging
Don't even nudge him, it's over for cousin, he caught a dozen
Just for fucking with the wrong animal
Animated no more, off to hell, yes I
[Hook]
[3rd verse]
When I'm down in ATL
Stat Quo keep my fo'fo'
So shawty know Obie for real
When I'm chilling in L.A
Dre keep my AK, so I'm like an esse
When banging that steel
When I'm out in NYC
50 hold artillery for me
Watch me shut down son and dunny
Listen, O-bizzle, hold the Tek-nizzle
Holding ya neck if you, disrespect Bizzle
Sizzle up tissue, missles will not miss you
Maybe ya momma, when that pistol uplifts you
[Hook]

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]
[Intro]
When I was just a little baby boy
My momma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older
And I realized, she was the crazy one
But there was nothing I could do or say to try to change it
Cause that's just the way she was
[Verse 1]
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They ain't say I can't rap about coke no more
Slut, you think I won't choke no whore
Til the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?
These mothafuckas are thinking I'm playing
Thinking I'm saying the shit cause I'm thinking it just to be saying it
Put your hands down bitch, I ain't gon' shoot you
I'ma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
Shut up slut, you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, okay Ma?
"Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing a whore
Snorting coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?"
You're goddamn right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple platinum
 
and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence, you vile venomous volatile bitches
Vain Vicodin,
 
vrin vrin vrin!
Texas Chainsaw, left his brains all
Dangling from his neck, while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts, knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch I'mma kill you
[Bridge]
You don't wanna fuck with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothing but a slut to me
Bitch I'mma kill you, you ain't got the balls to beef
We ain't gonna never stop beefing I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
, 
Imma be another rapper dead
For popping off at the mouth with shit I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me, I'm bringing the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothing but a girl to me
[Hook]
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (cause why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (ha ha)
I said you don't wanna fuck with Shady (why?)
Cause Shady will fucking kill you (cause why?)
[Verse 2]
Bitch I'mma kill you
Like a murder weapon, I'mma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows and
 
film you
Fuck with me, I been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm tryna develop these pictures of the Devil to sell 'em
I ain't "acid rap," but I rap on acid
Got a new blow-up doll and just had a strap-on added
Whoops! Is that a subliminal hint, no
Just criminal intent to sodomize women again
Eminem offend, no, Eminem'll insult
And if you ever give in to him, you give him an impulse
To do it again then, if he does it again
You'll probably end up jumping out of something up on the tenth (AAHHHHHH!)
Bitch I'mma kill you, I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it 3 or 4 times
In a tub.. but that's normal,
 
ain't it Norman
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of our medicine
Out of our minds and we want in yours, let us in or I'mma kill you
[Bridge & Hook]
[Verse 3]
Know why I say these things
Cause lady's screams keep creeping in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These 80 G's a week to say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
Fuck shots, I hope the weed'll outweigh these drinks
Motherfuckers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with 'em cause their ratings stink
Fuck that! I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From fat bitch to all 70,000 pounds of her
From principal to the student body and counselor
From in-school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin', I'm leaving air in your lungs
Just to hear you keep screaming for me to seep it
OK, I'm ready to go play, I got the machete from O.J
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep egging me on
'til I have you at knifepoint, then you beg me to stop
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talkin' to you, you hear me, answer me
Or I'mma kill you
[Bridge & Hook]
[Outro]
Ha ha, I'm just playing, ladies
You know I love you

[Intro]
Aww, look at daddy's baby girl
That's daddy's baby, little sleepy head
Yesterday I changed your diaper wiped you and powdered you
How did you get so big, can't believe it now you're two
Baby you're so precious, daddy's so proud of you
Sit down bitch, you move again I'll beat the shit out of you
 
(Okay)
[Verse 1]
Don't make me wake this baby, she don't need to see what I'm bout to do
Quit crying bitch, why do you always make me shout at you
How could you just leave me and love him out the blue
Oh, what's the matter Kim,
 
am I too loud for you
Too bad bitch, you're gonna finally hear me out this time
At first, I'm like aight, you wanna throw me out, that's fine
But not for him
 
to take my place, are you out your mind
This couch, this TV, this whole house is mine
How could you let him sleep in 
our bed
 
look it Kim
Look at your husband now (No) I said look at him
He ain't so hot now, is he little punk
(Why are you doing this?)
 
Shut the fuck up!
(You're drunk, you're never gonna get away with this)
You think I give a fuck?
 
Come on we're going for a ride bitch (No)
Sit up front (We can't just leave Hailie alone, what if she wakes up)
We'll be right back, well I will you'll be in the trunk
[Hook]
So long, bitch you did me so wrong
I don't wanna go on, living in this world without you
[Verse 2]
You really fucked me Kim,
 
you really did a number on me
Never knew me cheatin' on you would come back to haunt me
But we was kids then Kim, I was only eighteen, that was years ago
I thought we wiped the slate clean, that's fucked up
(I love you)
 
Oh God, my brain is racing
(I love you)
 
What are you doing? Change the station
I hate this song,
 
does this look like a big joke?
 
(No)
There's a [four] year-old little [boy] laying dead with a slit throat
In your living room, ha-ha,
 what, you think I'm kidding you?
You loved him didn't you
 (No)
Bullshit you bitch don't fucking lie to me
What the fuck's this guy's problem on the side of me?
Fuck you asshole, yeah, bite me
Kim, Kim! Why don't you like me? You think I'm ugly, don't you?
(It's not that) No, you think I'm ugly (Baby)
Get the fuck away from me, don't touch me
I hate you, I hate you, I swear to God, I hate you, oh my God, I love you
How the fuck could you do this to me
 
(I'm sorry)
How the fuck could you do this to me
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Come on get out
 
(I can't, I'm scared)
I said get out bitch (Let go of my hair)
(Please don't do this baby, please I love you)
(Look, we can just take Hailie and leave)
Fuck you!
 
You did this to us, you did it, it's your fault
Oh my God, I'm cracking up, get a grip Marshall
Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie
That was funny, wasn't it? (Yes)
That was funny, wasn't it?
 
(Yes)
See it all makes sense, doesn't it?
You and your husband have a fight, one of you tries to grab a knife
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced (No)
And while this is going on, his son just woke up and he walks in
She panics and he gets his throat cut (Oh my God)
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note
I should've known better when you started to act weird
We coulda...hey, where you going? Get back here
You can't run from me Kim, it's just us, nobody else
You're only making this harder on yourself
Ha-ha, got ya, go ahead, yell
Here I'll scream with you, ah, somebody help!
Don't you get it bitch, no one can hear you
Now shut the fuck up and get what's coming to you
You were supposed to love me
Now bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed bitch, bleed!! Bleed!!
[Hook]

Any rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time Trying to battle Eminem
Is worse than David Starr Trying to battle Proof, Eye-Kyu, B-Flat, Bizarre
 
?
 
that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
?
 
You're that bitch
, 
you couldn't slip up in the zone If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top And take this building down cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop

[Eminem]
Yo, yo, I start it off, yo, yo
My name is Shady, his name is Proof
Yo, we used to have a roof up on my house
And now we had a mouse that ate the cheese out of the fridge
Didn't want to admit that I was on welfare when I was three
Plus when I was four, my mother used to leave
She used to always slam the door and say
"Goodbye, goodbye Marshall, I'm leaving
I'm single and right now I'm going to mingle at bingo
"Yeah, see you later alligator" is what she said
And I would always stay at house freezing til I'm dead
Cause it was cold inside that house we never had no heat
Yo Proof used to come walking up right up the street and be like
"Yo what up Em? How you doing?"
I used be like "Yeah man it's good to see you dawg
But my life's ruined cause my mom just left"
She left my brother Nate and I hate the fact
We never had no food on our plate
So then Proof said "What up Em?"
Yo, so I said "Proof won't you come in?"
[Proof]
Yeah, yeah, come in what’s up with dat
Tango and Cash
Came to mingle and blast
Together tougher than Alcatraz prison bars
Driving foreign cars
Yes it's me and my man compadre
Black and white, white and ivory and black ebony
They can't step to me
Rubbery and heavenly
They can't see us in the 313 vicinity
Aiyyo Em, ha, ha, ha, ha
[Eminem]
What up? Ha, ha, I'm coming like ha, ha
I'm ill like nah, nah
And y'all don't wanna see me because I'm ill with the skill
And I can grill
 and 
I always keep it real
When I built my garage back after it just got burnt down
Sorry that my parents weren't always around
But it was really hectic growing up
But now I'm blowing up so it don't matter
Every show I do I'm always showing up
To the club drunk as hell, drunk as fuck, drunk as what?
Can't say that on MTV
But remember it?, little, old, wimpy me
Who used to always dream be on MTV
Now you can't see me
I know you remember that rhyme
Ay, wait a minute, yo check it out, I'm about to flatline
Pass the mic back to Proof, cause we get loose
We drink 
gin and juice
, 
sip it cause
 
we always raise the roof
[Proof]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, we all up in your sight like cataracts
Me and Em tag team
Beat any of y'all on some battle rap
See us next time we stripping out your Cadillacs
How you like that? Soon you down like a battle axe
[Eminem]
I'm down like a battle axe
I got a phatter axe to smash
And I smash your cataracts
Cause it'a a Cadillacs that I be driving
When I be high off fucking vivarin
Now you can't see me cause I'm reviving and surviving in
 
the D
Every single day in Detroit
If rappers wanna step to me they better get to the point
Cause they don't understand the way that I do it
The fluid that I be spittin' is never written
Cause I'm always, always spitting, cause it...
[Proof]
Aiyyo, you make your neck crack like a snare pop
We're fresh and they're not
So give it up, don't even do this
You're wack, 
in fact you get flat-lined
You need practice
We stick you like a cactus
Nah you're not a guy you're an actress
The fact is...
[Eminem]
Here's my address
This is my old address
And called: a street called Dresden
Yo, 
dead president is what I'm resurrecting
Gotta say "what's up?" to 
Desmond
 and 
J.L.B
But yo they don't help me do a thing, they never did
When I was a clever kid rhyming
I always used to go to school
And climb in the back 
baseball diamond
[Proof]
Hey yo, aboard, hold up
Hurt shoulder
Peace for 
Kurt Loder
Yeah, we're doing an interview
In a minute or two we're gonna enter in you
[Eminem]
In the nude, when we intrude
Don't mean to be rude but yo what's up dude?
How you doing MTV? 
How you doing Kurt?
How you doing everybody else in the world?
You getting hurt by this freestyle that I be coming up with
Erupting and kicking your mother in the tummy and in the stomach
[Proof]
Aiyyo, aiyyo, and all of this we just done is freestyle
Ah, ah, ah, 
don't touch that dial
Yeah
[Eminem]
Hold it right there 
I'm your worst nightmare
Wiping diapers on my high chair
[Proof]
What?! Yeah
[Eminem]
When I was this big, now I'm still bigger
But I'm skinny like a twig
Skinny little white boy growing up I liked noise
I spike punch and light joints
[Proof]
Aiyyo, everybody looks for us to follow
We thrust the bottle, thrust the throttle
Bust a bottle over your head
Train your thoughts just like 
Cus d'Amato
Your guts is hollow
Back up, Proof and Em
[Eminem]
And all them wack MCs step it to me
And say 
“nine deuce”
Just remember that I hate you and yo I can't stand you
Em & proof: 
Yeah! bye bye, goodbye good night, bye bye, good night, bye bye, good night, bye bye

[Ca$his]
Screech out, yeah
That's what I'm talkin 'bout {*bzzt*}
Ca$his, Shady {*bzzt*}
Good lookin Em
We in the Cadillac Cartel and Snoop DeVilles
Ridin on Treys like Barksdale, I'm movin steel
Step out and see the new Car-mellos you would steal
But you ain't runnin around here cause dude is real
You dub for fifteen minutes sayin they shoot and steal
I would tell you more, but I think, you would squeal
I'm ridin at the wheel, lean back, poppin pills
I make a lil' side money plus I got a deal
I'm nine kids deep; see, why I gotta deal?
And serve so the government, can't touch my skrill
Before I'm sittin in my big, house, on the hill
Dark, not in H.B., Hall go, have a meal
I am the bogus boy, that was in my uncle's will
You figured that out, and see that I'm a G for real
And fear man is one thing that he don't feel
Knock a nigga out, while his gun on him still
[Hook: Ca$his]
'Llac ('Llac) motion (motion) drop (drop) top (top)

New Makaveli jeans, five Vicks, Blue Leaf
Tall tee, hang to my motherfuckin knees nigga
I got a gang of my partners from O.C., figure
If it's some drama they all, ridin with me if ya
Recognize a situation that you can't win
You may feel like a marked mellow but you can live
Still you tryin to be hard, yellin out stupid shit
I just look at you laughin, say that you a bitch
I got somethin from class despite my truant seers
But I can whoop on yo' ass homie if you in Sears
It's better not to be brash and come with foolishness
Talkin 'bout my county 'til you see how true it is
Come to the 
7-1-fo
', 
Glizzy could get you rich
Some of the homies got dough, the rest is militant
We got goons that's loon tootin them wicked sticks
My whole set to end, Shady that's what the bid'ness is
[Hook]
[Ca$his]
We switchin lanes and candy paints on 22's
And '83s and '88s, in grammar schools
Different names of the 'Llac, I hear the hundred crews
Miss the exit, that's all from gettin blunted fool
Flick the tussin, a couple buzzards is comin through
Soon as they see me say "Ca$h, I wanna fuck wit'chu"
So many niggas is lamed out, and gullible
We make 'em lookouts in fog eyes for copper moves
I was livin the life, of sellin rocks to dudes
When I got to a block, I was unstoppable
I had to serve out the 'Llac, cause they was watchin moves
But bein poor was just, somethin I couldn't do
I wanna roll in a six-hundred and stunt on you
Next time I see you and yours, I'll pull a gun on you
Through every stage of my life, 
I been that fuckin dude
You should be glad I took, time to fuck wit'chu
[Hook]

[Intro: Obie Trice]
Can we re-enact Biggie's song?
Can you shit on me? I just want you to shit on me
, Obie
[Hook: Eminem]
Hey lady, hey darling, hey baby, I'm sorry
But I can't be, your boyfriend if you toy with, my mothafuckin' emotions
I'll kill you,
 bitch I'm fucking for real, I'll make you suffer
Like I suffered, if you fuck me, then I'll make you fall in love
(I don't think you really wanna be my girl
Fucking with me could be dangerous
You never know what I may really be like in real life
I'm the type, that might flip and get a little bit crazy)
[Verse 1: Obie]
Baby I'm extra large (huge) in magnitude
And Magnums the lubrication that I use
To chose which hole on a ho I abuse
Have 'em confused, can't tell who is who
When I fuck the shit out you, then the next day (bitch)
I'll rush the shit out you off my two-way (ooh wait)
You wanna cuddle, emotional hustle up on Pocono's
Poke ya nose in and outta Obie's own
No, I'm in and out your home
And this in, and out your tone
I ain't the nigga that settles 'em down
Put 'em in nice homes and floss 'em around
I bounce 'em around, camcord the sex
And sell 'em around town, how that sound?
If I was in love with ya, now you wanna clown?
Fuck with them clowns until I pound on your crown
Bust a few rounds and the cops come and get me
Bad mouth a nigga just to convince a jury
You don't want it with me, you just horny as me
You want a nut, nothing but what it should be
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm internationally known baby but actually
There are few people who know how I am naturally
All you know is that I can act irrationally
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV
So they label me this crazed loony rap bully
But truthfully that ain't the truth and if you believe
In that shit then you'll believe anything's true
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally
But personally that actually works for me
Cause the last thing that I need's a string attached to me
I'ma bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers
Cause see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully
But we do still make booty calls occasionally
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern
And we end up back at that god damn tavern
And having another deja vu, we seeing security
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry
I got news for you bitch, your new curfew's early
You ain't home by 2:30, [gunshot], you heard me?
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Obie]
See you looking at the life, you looking at the lights
You looking at the ice, you ain't looking at the Trice
You should look at some advice when I say he ain't nice
Despite the fact you think you the feisty type
O love to fight, I love the drama
Love when my bitch get to cussing out Yolanda (fuck you, bitch!)
Find the Obie condom on the counter
Swinging her weave, can't breathe like I can't believe!
Least I ain't deceive and try to mislead
And sell a dream just to get you on my team
I came clean to keep down the beef
Keep down my reach, you can 
keep all your teeth
, sweety
[Verse 4: Eminem]
What we do under the covers should stay between the covers
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage
On the front page cover of "Us" as new lovers
But this is when a bitch get to showing her true colors
Cause the truth of it, everything that I do's public
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends
Guess who you just screwed as soon as me and you've done it
And save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it
I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you
But you better be careful of who you're doing it to
Cause you never know when the shoe could end up
On the other foot and it backfires on you
Cause you may think you want it, then you want me, til you get me
Then you got me and you're fucked cause you'll be stuck with me
For the rest of your life cause if I get attached to you
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you
You'll be walking out the house and I'll run up and tackle you
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you
You don't think you're leaving this house in that, do you?
Not 'til I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you
And have you walking out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather
Front on me? Never cause we gon' be together forever
Right bitch? Right bitch?
[Hook]

[Obie Trice]
Here we go
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
You could get popped; it's a possibility up in my vicinity
Poppin off with that hostile energy
In a hospital with a doctor getting in
When adrenaline is mixed with an obnoxious temperament
Honestly I got a monster pistol gripped
And I commence to spit, none of y'all exempt from it
Spit, spit, passes from it
You get stiff from it, church man see your box plummet
And I will never let 'em give it to me
I gotta live to be one hundred and three
Gotta reach my epitome, wanna seize my enemy
And receive my penalty nigga
[Hook 2X]
LAY DOWN! (Lay down..)
I'm a man, man
I ain't runnin, I'mma stand wit my gun in my hand
I got plans and a place to BE!
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
I ain't tryna be cocky wit it, but I'm the nigga from the block that did it
Got a nine that's livid, I ain't tryna see the box in prison
Getting knocked outta my position
Now I got a pot to piss in, pissed off motherfuckers' mouth off - bitchin
Probably cause he lack ambition, so his wack decisions
Get mad at the nigga that's getting 'em
That's when he see the next nigga that's hittin him
With a vigorous pistol over this ridiculous issue
Dismiss you, in attempt to
Take me out my motherfuckin tempo nigga
[Hook 2X]
LAY DOWN! (Lay down..)
I'm a man, man
I ain't runnin, I'mma stand wit my gun in my hand
I got plans and a place to BE!
[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Niggas get nauseated, a artist made it
Had it hard against odds and emancipated
To the floor I spit cause, god damn they hate it
To see the lady they dated caterin to the latest
Shadiest artist
, up in my radius
Get faded with a plated revolver
Rated me R, haters get faded with horror
Erased, no fate for tomorrow
All cause he think he hard tough
Got a car cause, he was runnin at the mouth, hush
I will never let 'em give it to me
I gotta live to be one hundred and three
Gotta reach my epitome, or decease my enemy
And receive my penalty, that'll be the end of he
Tryna seize my entities, finna be the end of his identity
When I tell him to
[Hook 2X]

[Lil Jon]
STOP! IT'S THE MOTHERFUCKING REMIX!
[Intro: Mase]
Uhhh!!! Yeah, Harlem is back 
(TS)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (fo' real)
I heard Harlem is back (You know we had to do the remix)
Who in the world want a problem with that?
 
(Lil Jon: Yeah! Eminem nigga!)
Uhhh!!! Yeah, Harlem is back (Lil Jon: Lil Jon nigga!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Lil Jon: Mason Betha!)
I heard Harlem is back (Lil Jon: Fat Joe!)
Who in the world want a problem with that? (Lil Jon: Let's go!)
[Hook: Fat Joe]
Said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Come on
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull up our pants
And do the rockaway, now lean back, lean back, lean back, lean back
Come on
[Verse 1: Mase]
You know it's deja vu,
 and the day yall do
It'll be the day yall bleed
Wrist minus 80 degrees
King of Harlem ain't nobody made me leave
Who else could take 5 years off?
Cold turkey?
 
Come back and fly lears off
Cats front leave them leaning like Smirnoff
If haters wanna hate then its their loss
Come up in the Rucker
 with all my Jake's on
Car grills 
so big you can cook a steak on
People hear Mase call them wanna get their mase on
You hot 16, I'm a very great song
They beating on the DJ booth 'fore the Mase song
You play Clark Kent, you better have your cape on
Plenty homes Mansion many rooms
My necklace, 2Xs and three Bentley bulls
Lean back
[Hook]
[Lil Jon]
Eminem, what's up! 
Hey!
[Verse 2: Eminem]
You don't want no problems with Harlem
You don't want no problems with the boogie down Bronxter
You don't want no drama with the blond bomber
Original Don Dada of the blond bottle,
 the model from 
White America
Then Joe, the spokesperson for the Latino
Then we got Mase back to re-per-e-sent
E-ver-y-thing else in between
Including the percentages of the rest we don't
The best from each coast, the midwest to the dirty dirty
Even further to Miami, all the way back to 
Californ-i-a
It'd probably be best right now if I warn Dre to get on the horn and
Tell him about the storm coming all our way
So tell a pal, grab a gal right now, get on the floor while I wait
Shake that ass a little more my way, but baby, I don't dance
Not that I can't, there's a pistol in my pants
Come on
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
No Judas or cowardice that Caine's brother
Abel is able to stop me, nigga, NOT ME!
Got the streets asking "Damn, who can top P?"
Summer Jam killed it man they did it all with one beat
I guess I'm bi-coastal now
Took a down south brother to bring your boy out (WHAT?!)
As the wheel keeps spinning
I can hear niggas thinking Crack got one hit, then he out
Nope! Joey bring them semi's out
Force you and yours to pour a little Henny out
So much rappers acting in the game
I had to tell them put the mic away and run and get your Emmy's out
Lean back, motherfuckers
This here's a three peat we back at the Rucker
It's Cook Coke Crack, preach it to ya, brother
The mic more rap and preach you motherfuckers
[Hook]
[Outro: Lil Jon]
Said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, fuck nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
I said my niggas don't dance we just pull out our gats
And say blow your back away, bitch nigga
Lean back, lean back
Lean back, lean back
HEY!

[Kenneth Kaniff - {unknown person}]

{Ken wait! .. Nice going, Shaggy!}

[Hook: Eminem]
Yall better leave dat boy alone
Cause if they don't, yall know he gon' come back on 'em
And they don't want him to come back strong
I wouldn't dare get that boy going
I said leave dat boy alone
Cause yall don't know him
That there boy he out cold
And that there boy he been known
To tear some shit up when he in that zone
[Bridge 2X: Eminem]
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Better leave that boy alone
Cause you don't want to get that boy going
[Verse 1: Swift]
It's my attitude that's making me bust shit
I ain't to be fucked with
So basically niggas wasting they time trying to touch Swift
I run with a bunch of killers that dealt with punks
Be turning ghost 'fore you be looking at yourself get stomped
I'm a dysfunctional bastard who will puncture your ass
With a mag and, I'll be glad to send another one after you
Without no hesitation, I'll run up in your house and wake your spouse up
And give her gun to mouth resuscitation
A niggas information, they haunted and they sad
Got you mad cause they shitting through their stomach in a bag
We coming too strong so its irrelevant to blast you
We master ready, slash like relatives of Manson
When you hear us niggas think it's elephants dancing
Coming here is the worst mistake that could ever happen
When I'm in my vehicle, I'm pulling you in
I guarantee the world will never see you again
Motherfucker
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Honest to god I usually try to keep to my self
But it's kinda hard when you surrounded by ignorants, well
Let me explain something to ya
A real street nigga ain't trying to get in the streets
He's trying to get out, feel me?
And he ain't the type of dude to pop a E and get drunk
And wave his heat all in the air like he's some dumb ho punk
At least a soldier in the army lose his life over a cause
That nigga's dying over pride to prove he got balls
I play keyboards, I don't play beef
You borrow guns, I own shit that explode when it hit
You think it's fun that you home sick and you can't really get sleep
Cause you done laid a nigga down, but that ain't me
Well my conscience won't allow me to make decisions in vain
I'm a man, I do my business and I do it again
If you take it to that level, I take it to whoever
Want to harm me and my family, Runyon Avenue forever
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kuniva]
Now people I live trifling, I express it through writing
If you can't feel it, then I must express it through fighting
And I just bought me a new gauge and added on a new knife
And I strike people so fast, niggas think I threw lightning
Clash with a few titans, blasted a few hype men
Been harassed by two dykes who wanted lou pikner
Plus you know I'm too violent, to be out with you whiling
Cause as soon as you driving I'm a spit a few 5 ones
And I love to Kuniv' son, and you left a live one
I know how to hide guns, from skinny to wide ones
Go buy me a long sub and hide it inside buns
You looking for hoes, and up in here you going find none
You niggas done tried once, and you can kiss my nuts
You soft little dry cunts, get stomped till your eyes shut
No time for the why whats, 
I'm writing these five words
"Fuck you dick riding niggas," count it, it's five words
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
Swifty McVay (that boy he hot to death)
Mr. Porter (that boy he hot to death)
THE Kuniva (that boy he hot to death)
Yep, better step before you get beat to death
Yall dont want to get dem there boys
Dem there boys be makin noise
Dem there boys got all kind of toys
You better step before you get destroyed
D12
Dem there boys they hot to death them boys

After battling with his major label for years, 50 Cent has decided to become an independent artist.
The rapper announced Thursday that he's leaving his longtime record label, Universal Music Group's Interscope Records, and Eminem's imprint, Shady/Aftermath.
The Grammy winner and his G-Unit Records have signed a distribution 
agreement
 with Caroline, the independent label at Capital Music Group. Capitol is one of the many labels that are part of Universal Music Group.
50 Cent launched an ultra-successful, six-times platinum debut with "
Get Rich or Die Tryin'"
 in 2003, when he burst on the music scene with Eminem as his mentor. His sophomore album, 2005's 
"The Massacre"
 was almost as successful, but other albums didn't match his previous efforts and he expressed his unhappiness with his label. 50 Cent had been planning to release a fifth album on the label, but it was set with multiple release dates and singles, and eventfully didn't see a release.
His last album was 2009's "
Before I Self Destruct
," which also had several release dates.
"I have had great success to date with Shady/Aftermath/Interscope and I'd like to thank Eminem and Dr. Dre for giving me an incredible opportunity," 50 Cent said in a statement. "I've learned so much from them through the years. I am excited to enter this new era where I can carry out my creative vision."
50 Cent had a plethora of hits early in his career that dominated the pop, rap and R&B charts, from 
"P.I.M.P." to "Candy Shop" to the anthemic "In da Club," which introduced the young rapper aside Dr. Dre and Eminem.
"Both myself and Shady Records are grateful to have had the chance to play a part in 50's career," Eminem said in a statement. "Shady simply would not be what it is without 50 Cent. I've developed a great friendship with 50 over the years, and that's not going to change. We know 50 will have success in his new situation, and we remain supporters of both him and G-Unit."
The rapper, born Curtis Jackson, has also been a success outside of music, 
from film roles to fashion to books.
50 Cent's new album, "Animal Ambition," will be released June 3. Caroline has recently distributed albums by Korn and rapper E-40.

[Intro: Polina]
Tell me where to go, tell me what to do, I'll be right there for you
Tell me what to say, no matter if it's true, I'll say it all for you
[Verse 1]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority
Defiant often flyin' off at the handle at my mom, no dad
So I am noncompliant at home, at school, I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Trying to diagnose why I have all these underlying problems
Thinking he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalking up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive
Talking to myself, either that or inside hiding off in
The corner somewhere quiet, trying not to be noticed
Cause I'm crying and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fucking locker
Cause he said that I eye-balled him
[Bridge: Polina]
And if you fall, I'll catch you there
I'll be your savior from all the wars
That are fought inside your world
Please have faith in my words
[Hook: Polina]
Cause this is my legacy, legacy, yeah
This is my legacy, legacy, yeah
There's no guarantee, it's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy
[Verse 2]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come,
 
it's mind-bogglin'
Cause I obsess on everything in my mind
Small shit bothers me,
 
but not my father
He said sayonara then split but I don’t give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit look on the bright side at least I ain't walkin'
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me, life offers
Why bother even trying to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'
They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of trying to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something, like Onyx
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I want to say to the kid that said that I eyeballed him
Grab hold of my balls like that's right, fight's on bitch
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that
I could be iconic, in my conquest
That's word to Phife Dog from a Tribe Called Quest
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky is fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fucking giant sacks of lying dog shit
Now you shut up bitch, I am talkin' thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fucking worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
Cause you dicks butt kiss,
 
bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're going to die a ball licker, I've been diabolical
With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can suck a dick
The day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flying saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exalting and I ain't haltin'
'til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, I'm the Fire Marshall and this is my...
[Hook]

[Intro]
I'm legendary, legen-legendary, I'm le-le-legendary
[Verse 1]
The theme song to my supplier, plays in the key of a ki
, 
I'm like a messiah
Crossed with The Wire,
 
rapping around the Boardwalk Empire
Who brought their Bibles? This the Christ chapter
I'm sick enough to take my life then take your life after
Don't take me light or play me light: we two of the same
God melted the Rubic's cube into fluid and threw it into my intuitive brain
I'm eating food for moving music in the gratuitous lane
Been through twice, now I'm running through until I'm through with the game!
You can find me under a black cloud: I'm a dark star
Only thing I hate worse than a mark, is a marked car
I climb mountains like Marvin Gaye, Tammy Terrell
You could put a face on my style; it'd be Sammy Cassell's
I switch the fire up like I am a tranny from Hell
What I got in my hand right now should remind you of
 
Stanley Burrell
Cause it's the hammer, the cannon, you can dance with the shells
My pet peeves are 
granny panties
 
and planning to fail
I'm a heavyweight;
 I'm catastrophic
When I set it like Farenheit 9/11
, 
meditate 'til the levees break
I tar and feather featherweights until my 'fetti straight
The MAC-11'll clap your melon and give your ass spaghetti face
You ever looked inside some dying eyes?
You'll see surprise and realize there's no denying God
When was the last time that you heard that the "I" in "try"?
Ryan vibes
 
like cyanide
; 
I am proud
To say that I've evolved,
 
there's only one "I" in defying odds
Small-time arrogance perishes every time to giant pride
Who y'all respect is probably cross-dressing
Your favorite MC can probably find himself
, vibing to my 
Lost Sessions
I'm legendary
[Hook]
Now everybody wanna believe me
But they don't really know what's in my heart
This time around it's startin' to feel easy
My enemies starting to fall down
(I'm legendary, legen-legendary, le-le-legendary)
My enemies starting to fall down
(
I'm legendary
, leg-legendary)
Fall down (le-le-legendary, legendary, legendary)
I'm legendary
[Verse 2]
I got my noodles intact
You want support of Detroit rap, niggas can Google this gat
Cause we the reason why you eating, we put the food on the map
Right where the mitten is and you ain't do jack
Just who we kidding here?
 
This here's a different year
So you shouldn't assume that I'm tryna measure up to you
When I tell you the ruler is back, in fact
As far as you new kids, what have you did?
I know that I've burnt some bridges in the past, but I'm happy to say that I built a new bridge
As far as killing I'm forever willing and ready
I will make my children's peanut butter and jelly sandwich with a machete
You marry the streets then we will kill at your wedding
Tell every guest at your reception they gon' get more than just hit with confetti
Now your bitch a believer
You know what you get when you mix a bumblebee with a lamb?
You get the 'Ghini I'm sitting in
Riding through Pittsburgh
 
while I'm listening to Wiz Khalifa
Black and Yellow,
 
the blunted joint: here's the reefer
One minute you tough, one minute you shook
I know, I learned a while ago, to hide power from you, I should just put it in a book
You illiterate parasites: I kill you every time
Throw a nigga' body around the room, have a nigga looking like Jamiroquai
And yes I, am a firm believer that the naked truth
Looks a hundred times better than the best-dressed lie
And why you niggas is hating?
I wonder is God really an atheist? He made me the same temperature as his nemesis Satan
Y'all need to repent cause y'all been imitating
A statue of me, to you is a statute of limitations
You backwards as me and a feminist dating
Let's tally the sales like Gladys and Patti LaBelle: I'm a big wig
My straw's in the hole of a volcano: I'm having a big swig
[Hook]

Detroit
There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who would drive to you, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people
Stay up Detroit

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
This one's for you and me living out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes and now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters
[Verse 1: Eminem]
By the time you hear this, I will have already spiraled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards fuck my world up
If I was you I would duck, or get struck like lightnin’
Fighters keep fightin’
, 
put you lighters up, point them skyward, uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
Rap game’s nipple is mine for the milking
'til nobody else even fuckin’ feels me, 'til it kills me
I swear to God I’ll be the fuckin’ illest in this music
There is, or there ever will be
, 
disagree? Feel free
But from now on I’m refusing to ever give up
Only thing I ever gave up’s using, no more excuses
Excuse me, if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I’m a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin’ shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit
Who you dicks tryna kid? Flip dick you did opposite
You stayed the same, 
cause cock backwards is still cock you pricks
I love it when I tell them shove it 
cause it wasn’t that
Long ago when Marshall sat flustered, lacked luster
Cause he couldn’t cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy cause he’s buzzin’,
 
woke up from that buzzer
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it?
 
Wasn’t cause he had buzzards
Circling around his head waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it cause some bitches wrote him off?
 Little hussy ass 
scuzzes
Fuck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it?
What difference it make? What’s it take to get it through your thick skulls
That this ain’t, some bullshit
 
people don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage
And let be known from this day forward,
 
I wanna just say thanks
Cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise
 
cause I came with 5'9"
 
but I feel like I’m 6'8"
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Royce]
By the time you hear this I probably already be outty
I advance like going from toting, I end up going and buying 4 or 5 of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me, "Slow down boy, you're going to blow it."
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute
To tell Shady I love him, the same way that he did Dr. Dre on the Chronic
Tell him how real he is or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right, that I write till he can march right
In to that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in 20 years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
Cause what goes up, must come down
You goin down on something you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oow, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight, like Pacquiao
Y'all are doomed,
 
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself and auto-tunes
Cause now I'm in the Aston,
 
I went from having my city locked up
To getting treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossiping like bitches
On a radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all bugging out like Wendy Williams staring at a bee hive
And how real is that? I remember signing my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights, let it shine, because
[Hook]

I stay higher than racial tension,
 
with a facial expression
Tensed up like I'm suffering from a case of nasal congestion
Eyes hazel complexion, beige, age still in question
Critics hate my tape, kids can't wait for the next one
As long as there's rejects, my tape never ejects the deck
That's the level of respect each CD gets
While ya'll graspin at straws like me snorting crushed Aspirin
And gasping at air and collapsing in malls
I'm just a realistic impression of artistic expression
Who's tape is in the deck when kids shot up the delicatessen
So when I launch a verse full of controverse
That'll haunt you worse than Ma$e before he joined a church
I'm sorry kids I dismissed this class
I'm going back in the broom closet to sniff this gas
Um, Mr. Mather's just missed the bathroom
Pissed his pants and the world still kissed his ass
This is my last album cause this is my last Valium
Just pick my ass up when I pass out in the bathroom
If ya'll don't like the shit that you're hearing
Just blow me til you lipstick is smearing
And I can see my dick disappearing
May 23rd
That means we're taking over this year, you heard? (x2)

[Verse 1]
Modern day gangsta, old school playa
A find display of greatness at it's greatness
Send an array of strays at any patrian
Breaking down K's instead of quarters, it's kettle water
Please, no more zip locks or shoe boxes
My little niggas in school got shit now
All of the teachers in the school got fixed
When they seen me in the streets they give me gifts
I ain't riffing or rapping or yapping
No I ain't from the Nolia, but I'm clapping
No I ain't into coke, but I have it
No I ain't into dope, but I stock it
Like I ain't got the poll in my pocket
No I don't like Nicole's but I cop it
The white man looking like I ain't fin' to go in my pocket
No I ain't fin' to stop I'm still poppin
Holla, like I ain't at your throat
I'm a turtle neck collar
Our purpose is respect with a capital R
Whoever don't die today, they'll be back tomorrow nigga
I'm on a Harley, cruising by rides
With the stogey in my mouth,
 
Makeveli in the iPod
Weezy F., nine milli and the eye's lied
Make you think it's a fire squad
The way I find mine, in reality yall behind mine
So I can't see you, all you see is Evisu signs
Weezy

[Hook]
Step by step, heart to heart
Left right left, we all fall down like toy soldiers
Bit by bit, torn apart
We never win, but the battle wages on for toy soldiers
[Verse 1]
I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it
Even if it means going toe to toe with a Benzino
It don't matter I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle
'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted
And I'm so caught in it,
 
I almost feel I'm the one who caused it
This ain't what I'm in hip hop for, it's not why I got in it
That was never my object, for someone to get killed
Why would I want to destroy something I helped build?
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good
I went through my whole career without ever mentioning *Suge*
And that was just outta respect, for not running my mouth
And talking about something that I knew nothing about
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth
While he's all over TV,
 
down talking the man
Who literally saved my life,
 
like fuck it I understand
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business
I'm still knowing this shit could pop off at any minute, because
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and
Wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dying
But now it's elevated, cause
 
once you put someone's kids in it
The shit gets escalated,
 
it ain't just words no more is it?
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rapping
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it,
 
he wasn't going to go after him
Until Ja started yapping in magazines how he stabbed him
Fuck it, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction
Some receptionist at the Source who answers phones at his desk
Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous
Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothing?
Well fuck it, that mothafucka could get it too, fuck him then
But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind
We still have soldiers that's on the front line
That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus
To show 'em we love 'em back and let them know how important it is
To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is
But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
It ain't worth it,
 
I can't think of a perfecter way to word it
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict
I'll walk away from it all 'fore I let it go any further
But don't get it twisted,
 
it's not a plea that I'm copping
I'm just willing to be the bigger man if y'all can quit popping
Off at your jaws well then I can,
 
cause frankly I'm sick of talking
I'm not going to let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause
[Hook]

[Hook]
I know there’s something in the wake of your smile
I get a notion from the look in your eyes, yeah
We’ve built a love but that love falls apart
A little piece of heaven turns to dark
Listen to your heart
[Verse 1]
There’s a certain mystique when I speak
That you notice that it’s sorta unique
Cause you know it’s me, my poetry’s deep
And I’m still matic the way I flow to this beat
You can’t sit still, it’s like tryin to smoke crack
And go to sleep, I’m strapped
Just knowing any minute I could snap
I’m the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain’t even funny, I ain’t even hungry
It ain’t even money, you can’t pay me enough
For you to play me, it’s cockamamie
You just ain’t zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cockadoodle, my clocks cuckoo
I got screws loose, yeahhh, the whole kitten-kaboodle
I’m just brutal. It’s no rumor, I’m numero uno, assume it
There’s no humor in it no more, you know
I’m rollin with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a new hole in my ass
[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
I’m supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
I ain’t never supposed to show it, my crew ain’t supposed to know it
Even if it means goin’ toe to toe with a Benzino it don’t matter
I’d never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
I’m supposed to set an example
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide ‘em
If some shit ever does pop off, I’m supposed to be beside ‘em
That Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
There’s a certain line you just don’t cross and he crossed it
I heard him say Hailie’s name on a song and I just lost it
It was crazy, this went way beyond some Jay-z and Nas shit
And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
I spent too much energy on it, honestly I’m exhausted
And I’m so caught in it I almost feel I’m the one who caused it
This ain’t what I’m in hip-hop for, it’s not why I got in it
[Chorus]
[Verse 3]
I’m the man in my city ain’t nobody wit me
You can ask the real niggas and all the bad bitches
I’m a known drug dealer I always have 50′s
And the thugs and the killers was all in class wit me
SS’S on 26′s watching some television
Shorty I’m never slipping got the berretta in vision
And ready to pop the clip in, ready to get to tripping
Ready to show these folks a celebrity pistol whipping
Pimp stolen’ the automobile and the roof for the tag missing
Polices’ try to pursue me it’s nothing but gas given
Addicted to fast living, guess I’m one of my dad’s children
Think I’m bad now shoulda seen me before I had children
Give dick to ya daddy’s daughter and dare her to have children?
Hope he got some insurance ’cause death her is enduring?
Kill her in Mississippi and drive her to Missouri
Still my wet paint drippin’ while I’m woodgrain gripping
[Chorus]
[Verse 4]
There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
And wouldn’t have to worry about one of your people dyin’
But now it’s elevated cause once you put someone’s kids in it
The shit gets escalated, it ain’t just words no more is it?
It’s a different ball game, you callin’ names and you ain’t just rappin’
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin’
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
And asked him not to start it he wasn’t gonna go after him
Until Ja started yappin’ in magazines how we stabbed him
Fuck it 50 smash ‘em, mash on ‘em, let him have it
Meanwhile my attention is pullin’ in other directions

Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
But now he’s fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up
Was through that publication the same one that made me famous
[Chorus]

[Intro]
Yeah man is like I don't been through so much man
I don't see so much shit out here man
All this material shit man this shit don't mean shit to me man
You know its like I done did so much man I ain't got no shit to show for it man
Fuck The World man, naw Buck the world, yeah Buck the world I like that, yeeaah
[Verse 1]
Everybody trying to KILL me
I don't have no friends
I'm by myself in this mu
thafucking Benz
Don't you TEST me, nothings going right and yeah I wanna fight
So im jumping in the night you gonna RESPECT me
I don't wanna talk my nerves bad and I having suicidal thoughts
Somebody WATCHING me I can feel the heat who ever in here is scared
I can hear they heart beat and they ain't no STOPPING me
I'm out of control like a nigga locked up then just got out of the hole
What they DO TO ME, put me in this game give me all this fame
And expect for me to change my fuckin mind
[Hook]
You motherfuckers don't know me (Let's go)
You motherfuckers don't know me (Yeah)
You motherfuckers don't know me (Come on)
You motherfuckers don't know me
[Verse 2]
I am not going to jail, we gonna smoke our weed
We don't need no help, you don't wanna fuck with me
I do not CARE, ya won't get enough
I'm from the neighborhood where we throw the first punch
Get out my WAY, 
I had a bad day
My brother wouldn't have died if I had my AK
, 
ya don't FEEL ME
I am on the edge, so when I woke up on the wrong side of the bed
You don't LOVE ME, You just like my car
And if I ever went broke you find another star
Don't you TOUCH ME, I don't need a wife
I love my lil girl but her momma needs a life
[Hook]

[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs
 
but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down,
 
the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how
Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality
Oh - there goes gravity
Oh - there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad
 
but he won't
Give up that easy nope,
 
he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this mobile home,
 
that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo
 
this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Hook x2]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
[Verse 2]
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a New World Order
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada.
 
And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum da-dah
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my
 
nine-to-
Five
 
and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these God damn
Food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie
There's no Mekhi Phifer,
 
this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed
 
plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father
 
and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot,
 
another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point,
 
I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot,
 
or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
[Hook]
[Outro]
You can do anything you set your mind to, man

[Verse 1:]
You're not as cold as me, motherfucker stop pretending
I'll murder you in front of your crib like John Lennon
Rip the tendons out of your muscle to cut the tension
I'm beyond your comprehension like related subatomic particles in fifth dimensions
Suspension in your breathing is what I'm leaving until a legion
Of demons whisper the meaning of life in your ear
Right before they make your motherfucking life disappear
But just cause you hear the multi-syllabic grammatical
Don't compare me to rappers that are on sabbatical
Cause I never did business in little fucking Italy
I play checkers on triple-decker tour buses in Tripoli
The way that you typically bicker with me inexplicably
Is a mystery that pisses me off ridiculously
Because I'm lyrically beyond your level scientifically
Specifically spitting out the spic in me prolifically
I'm the majority of America futuristically
After I die, fuck my music, you'll feel me spiritually
Darker than Sicily ripping above the averages
You hold no weight, like bitches after miscarriages
And your label produces no kids like gay marriages
I'm disparaging every fake thug rapper in sight
That's why your faggot ass will never make it into the light
I'll crack your skull when I smash your face into the mic
And now you know what I'm like
I'll Suge Knight the industry, 
I feel like the spirit of Nat Turner got into me
You're infinitely hopeless, you sound like shit when you spit live
Like Jennifer Lopez,
 
I'll massacre a rich rapper
And all his broke friends, and go to Club Cheetah
Rocking some blood-soaked Tims, party crashing, animal-fucking model bitches
Leaving their stick-figure anorexic pussy in stitches
My verbal blitzes have outshined your offence
You're watered down nonsense, and I'm two-hundred proof
Choking the local youth in this home-made vocal booth
You're a fucking incomponent killer like Rae Carruth
And I'm Technique, the rawest nigga ever produced
I spit nastier than regurgitating period juice
So burn your fucking rhyme book
Stay warm, and put it to good use
I'm about to drop like frozen airplane-shit through your roof
And I'm sick of fake hustlas telling lies to the youth
You never robbed Dominicans, and you couldn't sling rocks if you was Palestenian
You broke motherfucker, you cats don't burn rubber
You niggas can't even get a fucking cab like Danny Glover
You ain't hardcore, I'll smack the shit out of your mother
You wanna be gutter? I'll leave you laid out in the street
Signed yours truly, the motherfucking Immortal Technique
[Outro:]
Yeah, Immortal Technique
Yeah, cut this motherfucker's face off

Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted. one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous,
 
but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down
The whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, bloah!
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit,
 
he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Hook:]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
(You better)
The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter

You can do anything you set your mind to, man

[Intro]
Look, if you had, one shot
Or one spaghetti, to seize every spaghetti you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
[Verse 1]
His palms are spaghetti, knees weak, arms spaghetti
There's vomit on his spaghetti already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm spaghetti
To drop spaghetti, but he keeps on spaghetti
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes spaghetti
He opens his mouth but spaghetti won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The spaghetti's run out, time's up, over - blaow!
Snap back to spaghetti, oh! - there goes gravity
Oh - there goes spaghetti, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't
Give up spaghetti nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope

The spaghetti's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This spaghetti is mine for the taking

A normal life is spaghetti; but superspaghetti's
Close to spaghetti, it only grows harder
Homie grows spaghetti, he blows it's all over

[Intro: Brick Tamland]
LOUD NOISES!!!!
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Life handed me lemons, I jumped back in the public eye
And squirted lemon juice in it
 
by now you just wish I’d fuckin' die
But I electrify, get electrocuted, executed by the execution
Of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin' by
(Choom chigga choom choom choom choom waa)
Guess who, what’s happenin' guy?
They told me to shit,
 
I fell off that pot hopped right back on that crapper
 and I
Said fuck it with a capital I, look who’s back to antag-g-onize
You don’t like it? you can eat shit, fuck off little faggot and die
You right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin' at my
Shit better get to the back of the line
, 
If you wanna get your shot at me what kinda crap is that battle
What kind of rapper would I be fore I let another rapper think he’s hot
I’ll bury my face in a stinky twat and go...
Girl my head, space is limited, so I ain’t even room in the back of my mind
That’s why I ain’t thinking about you, I don’t got time
 
I done told you a thousand times
So how can I find the time to put an alkaline battery in Royce's back
And at the same time put juice in mine?
 
Goddammit Slaughterhouse is signed!
[Crooked I]
SLAUGHTERHOUSE!
[Verse 2: 
Crooked I
]
I’m a menace villain,
 
my pen is sick and spilling
, 
my lyrics killing
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceiling
A niggas willing to give the listeners the sickest feeling
Like mixing some Benadryl and penicillin then I’m filling the clip
With a written, can you picture my pistol drilling
A million women and children when I’m illing but it isn’t real, it’s a rap
On the real, it’s a wrap
, 
how could you possibly stop the Apocalypse
When I’m atomic bombing the populous
Shock the metropolis hostile as a kid popping the Glock at his moms
And his pops
 
then he hops in his drop with his iPod rocking his slaughterish
Documentation
 of 
lyrics I write with confidence
Write like a columnist slash novelist
I’m in this game to demolish it, establish my dominance
Over prominent rappers
 
you popping shit to ya opposite
I can spit ominous so spit politics
Now I’m Haile Selassie
, 
Gandhi and Pac of this hip hop genre
, bitch!
[Crooked I]
SLAUGHTERHOUSE!
[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Lyrically I’m a cocaine Altoid
Ability so brain it’s a no brain bow boy (fresh)
Physically. I’m literally a cocaine cowboy
Wait-wait, did I just go almost four bars without talking about my big dick?
The other day me and 
your thick bitch
 
had a great date and we ate cake
And then we walked and then she tried to jack me off but she lost
Cause she couldn’t handle my Shake Weight, I swear,
 the irony of 
Ryan
 
is I am
Bipolar while I’m rhyming standing beside a big ole white bear
Neither one of us fight fair
, 
you are literally looking at Woody and Wesley
In a movie where the white boy ain’t got to jump
 
nowhere cause I’m here
Nigga I’m on fire, yeah and I’m every bitch’s dream
One, two I’m coming for you, I’m a big ole nightmare
Nigga, this the slaughter, step it up
I’ll pretty much slap your ass and tell you to shut the fuck up
After that, I’ll slap your ass again and tell you to shut the fuck up shutting up
And that’s how you body a fucking beat (Goodbye)
[Crooked I]
SLAUGHTERHOUSE!
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
I should be the one that goes slow
Nah, get a stopwatch, clock my flow, hit the button on top
Watch your jaw drop, 00:00 (oh oh dot dot oh) Yaowa
When I drop I go outer space
Blackout like Darth Vader’s face
, 
placed in a molten shower
Say something and get done proper, mama poppa pouring out vodka
Mama mia
Em pass me the scissors there’s visitors In the Slaughterhouse casa
Better jet boy go home, better jet boy
 
G4 Chrome
Better jet boy,
 
Mark Sanchez, Santanio Holmes
 I’m not your any 
old
 homeboy
Just sitting in the lab picking up a pad, I be spitting bad
I'mma get you mad with this gift
 
I have little ducks
Sufferin succotash
 
when the trigger blast
I’ma put your beak on your fitted hat
Where the liquor at? Sip a yac bad bitch and a vicious track
I relididax slide pro-tools to both
 
so smooth I coast to the West
Like where Crooked living at?
New York, here’s a piggy back ride to the motherland, hold on brother man
On the other hand, get down,
 
I’m gutter fam
Gun butt you with the Eagle handle Cunningham
I don’t wanna talk, I just wanna beef, I don’t want a piece
I want it all baby boy I don’t wanna eat, I wanna feast
Stuff my cheeks with rough beats and shit
You done, weak, I’m the one, capisce?
[Verse 5: 
Joe Budden
]
Insane what they call us, how you married to the game
But you probably shouldn’t of came to the alter?
Every bar like propane for the sawed-off you shoulda hang and they'll fault ya
Eminem, Mr. Porter, slaughter my sentiments, eminent torture
All of you feminine marauders, they're swimming that water, men will assault ya
Tommy's and bats to resemble Lasorda
Kidnap your trembling daughter
At least a quarter of my I’ma menacing supporter
It's got an aura more like Sodom and Gomorrah
Normally something’s wrong with me
Blame it on quantity of the porn I see on the pawns to me
When I fix the game y’all think shit came with a warranty
How the fuck are they gonna stop what I was born to be?
Corner me shit belong to me
Two choices, you can get along with me
Or sit your faggot ass right there in dormancy
Wait, all he missing is heels to be
 
RuPaul
Ain’t nobody that’s real ever knew y’all
And I’m second to none and I’m dealing with bums
Whose time never comes, now deal with the blue balls
You ain’t gotta fear me but you respect me
 
niggas who never met me
Threaten me, want to Gillette me
, 
coming to a sword fight against a machete
Swinging spaghetti like it’s heavy
Some said he
 
deserve an ESPY
 
in a Chevy like Andretti
Put the desi where his chest be
[Crooked I]
SLAUGHTERHOUSE!

(For all the ladies out there)
I never meant to give you mushrooms, girl
I never meant to bring you to my world
And now you're lying in the corner crying...

[Hook: Kid Rock]
Yeah I’m throwed off
Ain't about the money I’ma blow it all
I made my own lane
Let’s roll, let's roll
Yeah, I’m going off
Ain't got a whole lot but I’ma show it off
Better recognize game, lets roll, lets roll
[Verse 1]
Yeah now let me welcome you to my small town
Big trucks in the yard, big bucks on the wall, country folks all around
How I was raised
808 drums quaking, they shake that box, '88
And the dope boys hotter than hells gate
But I, still in the shade
With a fold out chair, a thirty pack on the back of that tailgate
A-L-A, B-A-M-A
I’m off I might pee in the lake
I might go to Talladega and see me a race
And bring me case
Yeah I’m bringing a case
I’m getting throwed off
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
And I’m all the way throwed off
Z71 take the bow off
Dipped in mossy oak with a mullet mohawk
Yeah with a bright orange hat and a bag underneath that Chevy seat
Yeah buddy, might go off
Split you like a bowling ball
Spit chew in my overalls
Yeah home of the gumbo
Got a couple folks that’d do it to you for the hundo
And when them elephant feet rumble
That dixie cup's gonna fall off the console
You don’t wanna have a convo and not understand that Bama slanguage
Like hollering ain't it
But I come to paint it, so it won’t be throwed off
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I’m just a Kid that Rocks
I’m just a boy with a dream
That bet it all with the last bill that I had hid in my socks
Used to keep a .22 in a shoebox
Now I bang Beretta
She’s twenty-two and I keep her in a tube top
White trash and all
Take us all the way to the top and then laugh it off
Like how the fuck did I get a catalogue with more hits than a fucking jackhammer dog
Cause I planned it all
Crimson Tide standing tall
Shit, I’m another lit cannon ball
Fuck around and I’m going off and I’m getting throwed off
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas, I'm still grinding (yeah), I still hearing those sirens
I'm still getting chased by those lights
Only the light's lime, and my mic's on
And my time is none, because I'm writing more
And I ain't here to meet a soul in this business
I'm here to eat, speak, until these ho's feel this
I ain't gonna let you derail me, man
I got Young Kobie homey, you gotta let go of Obie
Cause Obie be back, (going nowhere, man) we got them craps going on
And that yac going on, soon as a nigga touch down, back from touring
It's whatever, put that on the cheddar, man
But in the meantime, it's Jimmy Iovine time
Chase cheese, rhyme 'til my voice give out
This is it my niggas, this what we boast about
Now I'm here, so shut your motherfucking mouth, and show me love, bitch
[Hook]
I just wanna love ya, for the rest of my life (I don't love you, bitch)
I wanna hold you in the mornin, hold you through the night
(Right we wanna love alcohol, we wanna love guns, we wanna love money
We don't love no bitches, though)
I just wanna love, for the rest of my life
I wanna hold you in the mornin, hold you through the night
[Verse 2: Eminem]
There's a certain mystique when I speak, that you notice
Cause it's sort of unique cause you know it's me
My poetry's deep, and I'm Stillmatic,
 
the way I flow to this beat
You can't sit still, it's like trying to smoke crack and go to sleep
I'm strapped, it's known any minute I could snap
I'm the equivalent of what would happen if Bush rapped
I bully these rappers so bad lyrically
It ain't even funny, 
I ain't even hungry, it ain't even money
You can't pay me enough for you to play me
It's cockamanie you just ain't zany enough to rock with Shady
My noodle is cock-a-doodle, my clock's coo-coo
I got screws loose, yea the whole kit and caboodle,
 
I'm just brutal
It's no rumor, I'm numero uno, assume it
There's no more humor in it, you know
I'm rolling with a swollen bowling ball in my bag
You need a fag to come and tear a near hole in my ass, you better love me, bitch
[Hook]
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
My buzz is crazy in the hood, they holla my name
If it ain't about the flow, it's 'bout the stones and the chain
If I was you, I'd love me too, I roll like a boss
Nine eleven Porsche same color as cranberry sauce
I ain't gon' front, I thought R. Kelly was the shit
Let me find out he fucking 'round with Bow Wow bitch
Niggas eating popcorn right, rewinding the tape
Now shorty mama in precinct, hollering rape
I'm convinced, man, something really wrong with these ho's
I thought Lil' Kim was hot, 'til she start fucking with her nose
I used to listen to Lauryn Hill, and tap my feet
Then the bitch put out a CD and didn't have no beats
That boy D'Angelo, he determined not to fail
That nigga went butt-ass, for his record to sell
My back shots 'll help Ashanti hit them high notes
And Big Ben taught Charli B'More to deep throat (yea)
[Hook]

[Hook: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just going to stand there and hear me cry?
Well that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
[Verse 1]
I can't tell you what it really is
I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight
High off of love, drunk from my hate
It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer
I suffocate and right before I'm about to drown
She resuscitates me, she fucking hates me and I love it
“Wait, where you going?” “I'm leaving you” “No you ain't”
Come back, we're running right back here we go again
It's so insane, cause when it's going good it's going great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful
I feel so ashamed, I snap, “who's that dude?”
I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
You ever love somebody so much
You can barely breathe when you're with them?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them
Got that warm fuzzy feeling, yeah them chills used to get them
Now you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?
You swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them
Now you're in each other's face
Spewing venom in your words when you spit them
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them
Throw them down, pin them
So lost in the moments when you're in them
It's the rage that took over it controls you both
So they say it's best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know you cause today, that was yesterday
Yesterday is over it's a different day
Sound like broken records playing over
But you promised her next time you'd show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pain
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
And we fall back into the same patterns, same routines
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded
Baby please come back, 
it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back
I know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again
I'mma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire
[Hook:]

[Rihanna]
On the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don’t know why I’m still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you’ll always be my hero
Even though you’ve lost your mind
[Hook]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that’s all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that’s all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohhh, I love the way you lie
[Rihanna]
Now there’s gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you’ll always win
Even when I’m right
‘Cause you feed me fables from your hand
With violent words and empty threats
And it’s sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
[Hook]
[Rihanna]
So maybe I’m a 
masochist
I try to run but I don’t wanna ever leave
Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
[
Eminem
]
This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup
 
as we lay in the wake of destruction
Hush baby, speak softly
, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I’ll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I’m nothing, I’m so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you’ll always love me
Then after that, shove me
, 
in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we’re on, two psychopaths but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other’s backs
That we’ll have each other’s backs
, ’cause we’re that lucky
Together, we move mountains,
 
let’s not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who’s counting?
I may have hit you three times, I’m starting to lose count
But together, we’ll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we’re nuts, but I refused counselling
This house is too huge, if you move out I’ll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain’t shit you can do about it
Cause with you I’m in my fucking mind, without you, I’m out it
[Hook]
Love the way you lie

[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
You ready? One, two, three
[Hook]
The more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Cause you love me, and I love you more
[Verse 1]
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin' the same shit
We say we do it for our baby but we don't
We do it for us, it's lust cause neither one
Of us trust each other, so we fuck 'til we bust
And we cuss each other, out, we know what it's about, shout
'til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth
Fist fight 'til we turn this mother out
Then apologize after, laughter, pain
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin' here with you
There ain't nothin' anyone could ever say or ever do cause
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Cause I hate you, do you hate me?
Good, cause you're so fuckin' beautiful when you're angry
It makes me, wanna just take you and just throw you
On the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you
You fuck other people and I fuck other people
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil
In our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it
Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it
We can make accusations, people spread rumors
But they ain't got proof, 'till they do it's just the two of us
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she screwin' me
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed
If you didn't I wouldn't be hittin', yeah I would
Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to
That would be this soft and warm
So it's off and on, usually more off than on
But at least we know, that we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
I hope, the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact
And plus I can bust in that and that's why
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try
From junior high until we both die, it's silly
Oh why must we try, is it really so rough
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it geah
Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fighting
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
And it's clear it ain't gon' change, it's pent up rage
We both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged
By someone else, we've both been someone else's someone else
And the problem is neither one wants help
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
And they're probably just tired of hearin' it all the time
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme
All the hoop-la, all the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true 
You wouldn't do what, you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, cause this time girl I'm tellin' you what
You do it again I'm fuckin' you up
[Bridge]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'mma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me whore
[Hook]

[Produced by Mr Porter]
[Hook]
"I'm low down and dirty, but not ashamed"
I'm low down and I'm shifty!
And if you hear a man that sounds like me smack him
And ask him where the fuck did he get his damn raps from
[Verse 1]
Warning, this shit's gon' be rated R, restricted
You see this bullet hole in my neck? It's self inflicted
Doctor slapped my momma, "Bitch you got a sick kid"
Arrested,
 
molested myself and got convicted
Wearing visors, sunglasses and disguises
Cause my split personality is having an identity crisis
I'm Dr. Hyde and Mr. Jekyll
, 
disrespectful
Hearing voices in my head while these whispers echo
(Murder-murder, redrum)
Brain size of a bread crumb,
 
which drug will I end up dead from?
Inebriated 'til my stress is alleviated
"How in the fuck can Eminem and Shady be related?"
Illiterate, illegitimate shit spitter
Bitch getter, hid in the bush like Margot Kidder
Jumped out, killed the bitch and did her
Used to let the babysitter suck my dick when I was littler
Smoke a blunt while I'm titty fucking Bette Midler
Sniper, waiting on your roof like the Fiddler
Y'all thought I was gonna rhyme with Riddler, didn't ya?
Bring your bitch I wanna see if this dick gon' fit in her
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I lace tunes, I'm out this world like space moons
With a bunch crazed loons
 
dismissin brains like graze wounds
Nothing but idiots and misfits, dipshits
Doing whippits
, 
passed out like Sanford snippets
Where's the weed, I wanna tamper with it
I'mma let your grandpa hit it, mix it up with cocaine so he can't forget it
Fuck it, maybe I'm a bum
But I was put on this earth to make your baby mama cum
So what I'm on is way beyond the bomb
Or any alcoholic beverage, losing all of my leverage
Went up inside the First National Bank broke, and left rich
Walking bio-hazard causing wreckage
, 
smoked out like Eckrich
Bandage making my neck itch
, 
what the fuck? Give me the check bitch
You just lost your tip, there's a pubic hair in my breakfast
Got shit popping off like bottle cap tips
Get your cap peeled like the dead skin of your mama's chapped lips
Slap dips, support domestic violence
Beat your bitch's ass while your kids stare in silence
I'm just joking
, 
is Dirty Dozen really dust smoking?
If all your shit's missing, than probably one of us broke in
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My head's ringing, like it was Spider Sense tingling
Blitz ya like Green Bay did when they shitted on New England
I'm out the game, put the second string in
This Brandy got me swinging, bobbing back and forth like a penguin
Delinquent
, 
toking microphones with broken English
Make your mama be like "Ooh, this is good! Who sing this?"
"Slim Shady, his tape is dope, I love it
It's rugged, but he needs to quit talking all that drug shit"
It was predicted by a medic
I'd grow to be an addicted diabetic, living off liquid Triaminic
Pathetic, but I don't think this headache's ever vanishing
Panicing, I think I might have just took too much Anacin
Frozen mannequin, posted stiffer than a statue
I think I'm dying, God is that you?
Somebody help me, before I OD on an LP
Take me to ER ASAP for an IV
Motherfuck JLB, they don't support no hip hop
They say that's where it ends, the closest they gon' come is 2Pac
It's politics, it's all a fix, set up by these white blue-collared hicks
Just to make a dollar off of black music
 
with a subliminal ball of tricks
But those can kiss ass and swallow dicks
[Hook]

[Intro: 2Pac] I'm loyal to the game
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I've got task on a nigga's ass
Tell me will they blast me
I think of an alias in case these crooked bitches ask me, now
It's gettin' crazy after dark
These narcs be like tryin' to shut me down but I'm too smart
Now picture me scared of the penetentiary
I've been movin' these things since the days of elementary
Now tell me what ya need when ya see me
I'm stackin' G's buyin' all the things on TV, believe me
I got some killas on my payroll and they know
When it's time to handle business nigga lay low
Although I'm young I'm still comin up
I'm gettin' paid pullin' razors on niggas when they runnin' up
The first to pull the strap when there's drama
Buster you ain't heard?
I been slicin' motherfuckers since I lost my mama
There ain't a cop that can stop me
My posse is cocky and they don't wait until they drop me
I'm loyal to the game
[Hook: 50 Cent (2Pac)]
I do my thing respect my hustle I ain't playin'
(Nigga I'm loyal to the game)
You get in my way and I cock and pop that thing
(Man I'm loyal to the game)
If you know what I know then you know I ain't playin'
(I'm loyal to the game)
Nigga get in my way and I'll blow out your brain
[Verse 2: Young Buck]
Possessed by the streets you can't tell me that this ain't home
I can't eat if the rest of this shit ain't gone
I'm gettin' used to the needles on the bathroom sink
Gotta close my door because the bathroom stink
See, daddy don't work, and mama don't drink
But daddy do dope, and mama can't think
So look like I'mma be the man of the house
Gotta have somethin' to put in the air when it's out
Up early in the mornin' the first to get it
They say if you really want it then come on with it
Sacrifice my life for this ice and these cars
And I only spent 30 days behind bars
I ain't never had a job but my rent got paid
I handled any beef that they sent my way
So send me to the pen but you know I won't change
It's thug in my veins
I'm loyal to the game
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah
It ain't my fault I came up fast
And your the name niggas bring up last
And all the dames get a king up ass
10 grand on every ring I flash
Deep frog--and I'mma have to fling your ass
I'm on the block where it's scorchin' hot
If you get caught in the crossfire they have to throw you off the block
I get 'dro by the pickle jar
These broke niggas wanna get the star
So I don't keep the four-nickel far
My lips is zipped I'm loyal to the game
Bring your bitch around me I'm spoilin' her brain
Get more slugs to boil in your frame
Cause you got rocks and they got aluminum foil for a chain
The paint's the same color as oil in the Range
I'm stingy ain't got nothin' for you but some change
I'm good now but the fact still remains
That the struggle that I'm from is attached to my name
[Hook]
[Outro: G-Unit & 2Pac]
Heh
YA!
2Pac's in this motherfucker!
Uh!
G-Unit in the motherfuckin' house
50!
Banks!
Buck!

[Intro: Bizarre]
Mic Strings
Welcome to Our World
Turn your CD's up!
[Eminem]
WOOO!!!!! Yeah! AAAAAAHHHH!!!!
 
(Motherfuckers think they know us)
Guess who's back?
 
D-Twizzie!
 
O-Trizzy!
Doc-Drizzy!
 
Shady-Twizzie slash Aftermath!
50 cent!
 
G-Unit!
 
Here we go! Free Yayo!
Motherfuck a Benzino!
 
They don't know we finna blow!
Someone better tell them so
[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
You don't McVay and I doubt if you understand me
Why would I give a fuck about you if we ain't family?
I roll with a chosen few and those of you that's behind me
Witness the most coldest, ferocious niggas that rhyme
These bitches turn they back on you, acting like they ain't did shit
When you rapping never mix business up with your friendship
If you lacking up in this jungle, then what you breathe for?
Niggas's don't love you, you got habits of breaking street codes
Far as static, I automatically get medieval
When I'm after people, then I'll explode you bitches with C-4
These hoes have no insurance, bodies get repo'
Making you vanish even when we ain't got our heat close
Keeping .44's where you're hoes are swallowing deep throat
If you owe me dough then you know you falling asleep, close
Niggas pupils that's what I do, I'm foolish will shoot you
Cuz' I'm coo-coo, but I don't think niggas can take in heed though
[Hook: Kon Artis] (2X)
See I'm a man, and a man gon' do what he gotta do
And he ain't really family if he ain't loyal to you
If they was really soldiers then they would do what we do
And be loyal to crew when crew was loyal to you
[Verse 2: Bizarre]
I don't give a fuck, I'm quick to blaze chronic
Smoke on so much green, you swear I was a supersonic
Bizarre pack guns and knives, put to dick to nuns and wives
Now who the fuck want to fight?
Ain't nobody fucking with me, Ain't nobody fucking with the D
They get beat like a M-P
You heard about Bizarre taking all them drugs
You heard about Proof wilding in the clubs
You heard about that nine that Eminem packs
You diss us, you get you're fucking face cracked
I'm from 7 Mile and stout, I'll shoot up you're house
Next day, I'll pee in you're mouth
[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
Ayo, loyalty's first, all the bullshit second
I showed you on the record, Cheers to who respect it
Most of these niggas neglect it
Even though it's a known method
From the hectic hood that you slept in
You wanna be an exception
That's when the weapon is leaving you're half stepping
With that 'caine in you're left hand
Obie from a section that'll stain up you're flesh and
Have you on bed breast
Questioning you're affection for streets
D-Twizzie no question
One of the best groups that done it
And Obie is their reflection
Lil homie that know soley that loyalty is reppin'
D-Twizzie for life, Obie Trice is second
[Hook] (2X)
[Verse 4: Proof]
Which one of you niggas wanna be bulsh' and bump heads
When I got a passion for clapping... with one hand
Talent's on my roster this mobster'll dump lead
Send a gangsta to sleep two by two like bunk beds
Never leave the crib without packing my black burner
On some Chi Ali rapper to murk and have murder
Incorporated,
 
Hitman Harry is at your service
Reach for me one more gain' and that's curtains
For life as D12,
 
no ice and spreewells
Every night that I chill in, I fight by free-will
Knowing I can be killed
Leaving my group, pieces of proof
With a reason to shoot and a license to ill
We lost Bugz and I'll be damned if we loose another man from our clan
Without forcing our hand
Extorting you're family, I'll torture you're granny
For my niggas, I'm on you're motherfucking porch with a Cammy
[Hook] (2X)
[Verse 5: Kuniva & Kon Artis]
Yo, it's funny how niggas get caught alone (And get bombed on)
Knock your teeth in back of your throat (And break you're jaw bone)
(I'm on ignorant shit) these niggas is bitch
Pass me a cigarette quick (Shit is finna get thick)
Your man'll get split (By a brutal and critical hit)
With identical dents (Or bullets with identical prints)
I'm wishing you if (You come your Lieutenant's a snitch)
Your tenement's sick (And we know you ain't finna do shit)
I'll stick with my clique (The Kon Artis, Bomb Artist)
Kuniva, The Rida 
(Shooting through you're fucking Long John garmets)
Dirty Dozen (We deep in the street)
Unbelievable heat, we'll even lay you out in front of the chief of police
Motherfucker
[Hook] (2X)
[Outro: Kon Artis]
Yeah! D-Twizzie
D12, Dirty Dozen
Nothing but family up in this motherfucker
Loyal to everything that we do
You ain't never gonna catch none of us slipping by ourself
Cause we always together
You know what I'm saying
Y'all niggas don't know what family means
Bugz watching over our ass
That's why we still alive know
Knocking y'all niggas out of the clubs and shit
Haha! Runyon Ave Baby!
Shady Records!
Where your 
momma
 at, 
nigga
?

[Intro: Young Zee]
*Talking*
I'm allowed to fuck up whenever... whenever I want...
This the Outhouse...
Lemme smoke a joint first...
Here, Pace...
[Verse 1: Young Zee]
95% of all y'all rappers butt
And y'all ride dick so much y'all gon' make me nuts
You'll get your jaw clocked, I'll drag your ass for four blocks
Dunk your head in Clorox, use your dreads for my floor mop
Gay or straight, 
my Papermate'll do a date rape
Zee can't wait, I'll go Great Bank on a blank tape
Lost like Spigg Nice
, 
stick you for your thick ice
Good to hit twice 'fore you catch me usin' trick dice
Go to parole off of two in stolen wheels
My colon holdin' pills, fuck takin' some Golden Seal
I smoke leaky and 
black like BET
And fuck hoes raw dog 'til my balls catch VD
Mess with us, straight up, y'all better bust
I'm the one you'll never dust, it's still the same as it ever was
I'll leave the crowd in a Coupe with white walls
And scream, "If y'all ain't Outz then y'all could ride my balls!"
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
I fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets me high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
[Bridge: Young Zee]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
[Hook: Young Zee]
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Ma-sa, Ma-macosa
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Ma-macosa
[Verse 2: Slang Ton]
Yo, all the boys in the lobby get needles filled with poison ivy
Put 'em in the hospital and give 'em a poison IV
My crew get high much off brew and Thai skunk
It makes my style off the wall like suicide jumps
We sip lots of liq' shots
It makes my hip-hop fat as your lip got when I
Kickboxed with flip-flops
And give a disk jockey six copies of this floppy
Shit I be dyin' for is your piece of shit hobby?
You borin' like foreign Dice
, 
I'm more than hype
Bungee jumpin with cordless mics, for tourists sites
Ton Slanga,
 I'm dopin', pills and cokin'
Lung cancer in my throat and still smokin'
[Break: Az-izz, (Young Zee), & [D.U.]]
Now, when your partner die, who got the right
To do the homicide and you shot the guy?
And when you's 'bout to cry who got you high?
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
I'll blast the guy that don't pass the lye (uh-huh)
Leave him paralized and (agonized)
Fellas, grab the thighs that's by your side
(Say Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa)
[Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-maco
Huh?]
[Verse 3: Pace Won]
Wanna live this Outsida business
Blunt splitters, all that
Multiple musical contracts to fallback...
On... 
set like I was Liu Kang for Kombat
...
Armed like Emmit when I rush crews
More hardcore than DMC and Krush Groove
Don't need hands to touch you
Mr. Perfect, the one you want to rap like
The name rap fiends have 
in their mouth like a crack pipe
Slap the fuck out you, remember us
I'm the man your father never was, or could've been
Maybe if they passed out weed in high school, I would've went
Got it down, yo
Even if you sing like 
Brownstone
 you couldn't "Take The Crown Home"
Try to call me out and get the dial tone
Pace Woner, 
dickin' 5-0
 in a stolen gray Hummer
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Me and Pace
 
had to flee in haste from bein' chased
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold
I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and muah
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
[Refrain: Young Zee]
(Yeah!)
Beef with us you might just catch a black eye
And ride for your crispy 850-I
We fuck with them drugs 'cuz it gets us high
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
[Bridge]
Been doin' this rap shit since '85
Then 'Clef put me down with the Fugee-la
It's only right me and Yah get a piece of the pie
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa
[Hook: Young Zee & Eminem]
[Outro: Young Zee]
Mama-mama-mama-mama-macosa
*talking*

[Hook: French Montana]
Watch me make what I lost
I ain't gotta choice it is what it be
Watch me make magic
I pull that pigeon out the hat
Pull that 50 out the bag
Gunning, niggas out her
e dum
bing
It ain't where you from, it's where ya at
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Got an axe in the bag, couple of fags
Stuffed in the backseat muzzled and gagged
Wrapped in bubble wrap 2 lesbians a couple hustler mags
Now grab the pez dispenser
Fill it up to the max with muscle relaxers
The governor of Alaska
She lusts when I ask her
To shove my pulaski sausage up in her ass huh
While we hover over Nebraska
Shooting at the fucking Buffalo pastures
In the helicopter
 
man I can't fuck her no faster
She's screaming grab my titties shady suck on those bastards
But I ain't no sucker
I won't snuggle up with her after
I'm a Gigolo, bitch I look like the Juggalo rapper?
Everyday man I just seem to get a little bit doper
But shit back down, man I'd rather lick on the scrotum
And eat the fuckin' octo mom pussy lips with some okra
While I watch Whoopi Goldberg scissor with Oprah
While Rosie pussy farts and takes a piss on the sofa
Get the boner and play dick swords with the Jonas Brothers
Your motherfucking mothers aromas
Like no other I keep thinking of her smothered in soma's...
[Hook: French Montana]
[Verse 2:French Montana]
I'mma take em to the top
They ain't fucking with the top deal
Top player im the new Dre, Snoop, Pac
Big chain ice hot
His slang white block
Bread pumping like speakers
Flow Ether like Nasir
You can bulletproof ya truck and get shot still
Shots peel, 40 turn your brains into oxtail
Pop pills, shawty pussy right but her top real
She took the condom off and jerked me off like the lox's deal
All I bump is Jada and Max
Bent with the cramium cracked
Smoother like that henny and black
I be the mac with the 2 slugs, ski mask
Two gloves ask about them boys tall like manute was
[Hook: French Montana]

[Hook]
Every night, I make a wish for you
I try to close my eyes
But at times I'm forced to face the truth
You're all I love, my life
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom, napping at noon
Yeah dad's in a bad mood, he's always snapping at you
Marshall what happened that you, you can't stop with these pills
And you've fallen off with your skills, and your own fans are laughing at you
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle, get up
Be a man, stand, a real man would've had this shit handled
Know you just had your heart ripped out and crushed
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that
He wouldn't fuckin' shoot at, no-body, he fights first
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse
Now I'm popping Vics, Percs and Methadone pills
"Yeah Em, tight verse, you killed it"
Fucking drug dealers hang around me like yes men
And they gonna do whatever I says when, I says it
It's in their best interest to protect their investment
And I just lost my fuckin' best friend, so fuck it, I guess then:
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there
And I continuously stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me, what the fuck good does
That do me now, but somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh, I went and dropped some presents off for Easter to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dog you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in they eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
[Hook + Interlude]
Every night, I make a wish for you (sing) (sing it)
I try to close my eyes (come on..)
But at times I'm forced to face the truth
You're all I love, my life

[Eminem]
Hi, my name is, my name is nobody famous
Guess what? I'm an anus
I'm here with Mancow, haha
You know how I do it, cause I kick this fluid when i do it
I bust it, I kill it and I crush it with Mancow
You don't understand how we do it
We land now with hits and freestyle flows
Cuz we the ish, I said ish backwards and guess what that is...
Shhh, yea I can't say that, yo, hit the playback
Check it, cause rappers don't know how to display that
Rhymes that I be kicking, freestyle when I be kicking
Sticking these, ribs sticking out, poverty stricken
I'm all hungry cause I ain't ate in ten minutes
I'm infinite
, 
oh, hey, check it out, I'm Ken Kaniff
Oh, hi there man, oh yeah
Hell no bro, oh yeah, no, yeah
Oh here I am I'm chillin' with Mancow
You know how we do it man you know we got the know how
Mancow kick a freestyle

[Intro]
Many men, wish death upon me
Blood in my eye dog and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And suckas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in you for running with me
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
[Verse 1]
Now first off Hip-Hop's a competitive game
And everybody's either after money or fame
I'm after the latter,
 
so throw dirt on my name
Then I'll reciprocate, multiply, and double your pain
I don't play and eye for an eye, no tooth for a tooth
More like you call out my mic, and I'm destroying your booth
I don't think you're prepared to do what you gotta do
You lay a hand on me, I'll lay a hollow on you
I'm a little to grown to be fighting and scrapping
So if you walk up on me I'll put a round in your skullcap
Threaten me in voice mails
 
where it's easy to act
Enact any violence, I'll put it all in the past
I don't go anywhere without a weapon concealed
Don't test me 'less you wanna know how metal feels
I've come closer to killing myself than any of you will
So don't come to see me unless you're ready to kill
[Hook]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
Lord I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
[Verse 2]
Make a lot of enemies when you're the only one that's real
Oh no, can't say that you're the only one that's real
Oh no, that don't fly, it's the competitive nature
But unlike you I'll go to any lengths for
My respect, now it's a war that you've started
A forest fire, and you just plain retarded
Not flame retardant, homie you not hard at all
If there's a heart in your chest I hope you guard it
Finger on the trigger if you're the one that I come for
Then I leave you stretched out I ain't playing this summer
Threaten the only one that's done work for
His city, the mile high lyrical head hunter
Where you been...not shooting
I host the D like DJ Whoo Kid
Hardest thing you say: "Don't make me catch a body like that"
But Hiatus ain't scared of nobody like that
[Hook]

Man we gotta go get somethin to eat man
I'm hungry as a motherfucker
[50 Cent]
Ay yo man, damn what's taking homie so long, son?
[Lloyd Banks]
50, calm down, here he come
[9 Shots]
[Lloyd Banks]
Ahh, ohh, what the fuck
[50 Cent]
Ah, son, pull off, pull off
[Intro: 50 Cent]
Many men wish death upon me
Blood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see
I'm trying to be what I'm destined to be
And niggas trying to take my life away
I put a hole in nigga for fucking with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
Cause I'll come and take your life away
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
[Verse 1]
Now these pussy niggas putting money on my head
Go on and get your refund motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme something special happen every time
I'm the greatest something like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble
, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go'head lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around gun on waist, chip on my shoulder
Till I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over
[Refrain]
Many men, many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death upon me
[Verse 2]
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twisting trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doing life behind bars
I don't say only God can judge me cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?
[Refrain]
[Verse 3]
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothing back
I know he protecting me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares niggas keep pulling TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gonna spell it out for you mot
h
erfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines
In the Bible it says what goes around comes around
"Hommo" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fucking breathing
[Refrain]

[Intro]
You know I just don't get it
Last year I was nobody, this year I'm selling records
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em something
The fuck you want from me, ten million dollars? Get the fuck outta here
[Hook]
You see I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me
Nobody ever gave a fuck before, all they did was doubt me
Now everybody wanna run their mouth and try to take shots at me
[Verse 1]
You might see me jogging, you might see me walking
You might see me walking a dead rottweiler dog
With its head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar
Hollering at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barking
Or leaning out a window with a cocked shotgun
Driving up the block in the car that they shot Pac in
Looking for Big's killers
, 
dressing ridiculous
Blue-and-red, like I don't see what the big deal is
Double barrel 12-gauge bigger than Chris Wallace
Pissed off cause Biggie and Pac just missed all this
Watching all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em
And get dollars that should've been theirs like they switched wallets
And amidst all this Crist' popping and wrist watches
I just sit back and just watch and just get nauseous
And walk around with an empty bottle of Remy Martin
Starting shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman (Goddamn it)
An anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin
Whose instinct's to kill N'Sync, don't get me started
These fucking brats can't sing and Britney's garbage
What is this bitch, retarded? Give me back my sixteen dollars
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling
Whatever happened to
 
wiling out
 
and being violent
Whatever happened to catching a good old-fashioned
Passionate ass-whooping and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken
[Bridge]
New Kids on the Block sucked a lot of dick, boy/girl groups make me sick
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public, I'mma love it
[Verse 2]
Vanilla Ice don't like me, said some shit in Vibe to spite me
Then went and dyed his hair just like me
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me
And run around screaming, I don't care, just bite me (Nah-nah)
I think I was put here to annoy the world
And destroy your little four-year-old boy or girl
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer
And call themselves clowns cause they look queer
Faggy 2 Dope and Silent Gay
Claiming Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fucking faggots)
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fucking faggots the fuck out
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out
After they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow
Look at y'all running your mouth again
When you ain't seen a fucking mile road south of 10
And I don't need help from D12 to beat up two females
In make-up who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails
Slim Anus? You damn right, slim anus
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots
[Hook]
Cause I'm just Marshall Mathers
I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out if you talk about me
Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes doubt me
And if you wanna run your mouth, then come take your best shot at me
[Verse 3]
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?
You little groupie bitch, get off me go fuck Puffy
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top
Of this fucked up head that I've got I've gone pop
The underground just spunned around and did a 360
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy
So now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"
My fucking bitch mom's suing for ten million
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealing
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress
Which is it bitch: Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?
It doesn't matter [your attorney Fred Gibson's a] faggot
Talking about I fabricated my past
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do
For every million I make, another relative sues
Family fighting and fussing over who wants to invite me to supper
All of a sudden, I got ninety-some cousins
A half-brother and sister who never seen me
Or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV
Now everybody's so happy and proud
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house (Hey!)
And then to top it off I walked to the news stand
To buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast
And what do I see? A picture of my big White ass
Okay, let me give you mothafuckas some help
Um here, "XXL! XXL!"
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Something's burning, I can't figure out what (out what)
It's either lust or a cloud of dust
Judgement is clouded, must just be the powder from the power of (love)
But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
Left my girl in the house alone, is that my soon to be spouse’s moan
And the further I walk, the louder
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt I
Think I might be about to busta, bust her
The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts - brace
Hope it ain't, "Here we go, yo," cause my head already goes to worst case Scenario, though in the first place
But you confirmed my low end theory though
Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
And that was only the first date
Could've made it to home plate
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face
First, "no (slurp) you don't (slurp) under (slurp) stand (slurp)
I (slurp) don't (slurp) do (slurp) this for anyone, ever"
Yeah that ain't what they all say
I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw
Used to be my fiance
'Til you sucked on Wayne, Andre, and Kanye
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e, Polow Tha Don, Dre
Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame
Guess I'm gettin' my g-god dang Jigga on, eh
Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'
But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray
But I'll probably always keep on playing
[Bridge: Sample]
The game of love, love, love, love
La-la-la-la-la love
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
She doesn't love me, no she don't love me no more
She hates my company, yeah she don't love me no more
I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door
She screamed she loved me like she never did before
And I told her
(Go where you wanna go, go do whatcha want to do; I don't care) x2
[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I told that bitch
I'm a sucker for love, you're a sucker for dick
Sucking dick in your momma tub, then your granny walked in
Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
He drowned, like an abortion, they booked you for manslaughter
You beat the case and I called ya
"Sherane is not available now leave a message at the tone
And Kendrick don't forget to buy two pair of those
Expensive heels, you little fucking Ferris Wheel
Fucking spinning on me, fuck you think we gon' get married still?
Fucking Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale
Fairy godmomma better tell you how I fucking feel
Like you should fuckin' beat it or fucking eat it while I'm on my period
Now have a blessed day,"
 
bitch, you serious
I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious
Why you ain't fucking with me, you cut me deep as a Caesarean
You know I want you bad as a Benjamin,
 
I'm delirious
I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killing him
His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
That's analogy and metaphor for you
I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
This is me talking cordial, yeah I got some home trainin'
That ain't what you like, ain't it, what about if I was as famous
As Marshall? Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle
Singin' "I hope she's good enough"
Meanwhile you're chasing her
Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
Pity the fool and pity the fool in me,
 
I'ma live with the
[Bridge: Sample]
[Hook: Kendrick Lamar & Eminem]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
Snatch my house key off her key chain
She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
Now she's chasing me with a cheese grater
Here goes that broken record, cliché, it's all my fault anyway
She's turning the tables, I'm a beat-break
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display, is symptomatic of attack behavior
Back together but forgot today was her b-day, she cut me off on the freeway
Simple misunderstanding but just as I went to slam on the brakes
That's when I realized that she may be as crazy as me, wait
Bitch cut my fucking brakeline, stepped on them fuckers 8 times
Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit coming up
What the mother F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
Hit the off ramp
 
'til I coasted to a goddamn halt, hit a fucking tree
Now here she comes at full speed, she's racing at me, okay
You wanna fuck with me, eh?
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she screaming
I body slam her on the cement, until the concrete gave
And created a sinkhole, buried this stink ho in it
Then pay to have the street repaved
(The fuck?)
 
Woke up in a dream state
In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's laying next to me in bed
Directly aiming a gat at my head!
Woke up again and jumped up like fuck it, I've had it, I'm checking into rehab
I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy
Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
Or I'm too fucking dramatic
Man what the fuck is the matter, I'm just a fucking romantic
I fucking love you, you fucking bitch!
Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
I said, "Hit the road" and after she left, I sent that bitch a text
I said, "Be careful driving, don't read this and have an accident!"
She glanced to look at it and wrecked
Too bad,
 
thought we had a connect,
 
no sense dwelling makes
Never been a more compelling case
Than the model covered in L'Oreal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytelling
While the whore was yelling, "Rape"
'Til her vocal cords were swelling
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates
And my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
Unless you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date
Don't be late, well the sentiment's great
But wait, think there's been a mistake
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of, (*Message sound*)
"Wait, dinner at eight?"
I have infinite hate in my blood
It's mainly because of the game of...
[Outro]
Love, love, love, love

Maxine!
 (Phone Rings)
Maxine: Hello
Denaun:
 Can I speak to Maxine?
Maxine: Yeah this is me what's up?
Denaun: What up?
Maxine: Who dis?
Denaun: Denaun
Maxine: Yeah what's up?
Denaun: What are you doing?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Huh?
Maxine: Nothing, just laying in bed
Denaun: Why?
Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I know this crack fiend, Maxine
, 
who needs a vaccine
She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean
Plus she got a sugar daddy
Gassing every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly
If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation
You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
When you stepped away, son, she got her face done
Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if
You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you
If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice
But when you catch the lice
, 
or get the urgency
To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee
Don't bring your germs to me,
 cause I ain't tryna hear it
While you're fightin' your fuckin' disease tryna clear it (Maxine!!)
[Verse 2: Kon Artis]
Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life? That is
To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit
You livin' trife, got three kids at home and club-hoppin' every night
You say it's gonna stop but it just... slows... down
And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this
Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be
You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that
When you got niggas hiding in your closet
I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely
[Verse 3: 3]
I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me
So I stepped on it and then asked my homies
And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas
Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number
I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said "Hey Bitch..
Haven't I seen you before?", looked at my nigga
Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands
And said "Oh it's like that?"
She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit
She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit
She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number
She asked could I give her mine two
Got to the crib and called her up
We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck
I said "Maxine check this out
Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"
Got to the crib she let me in
She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom
I said "Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"
What the fuck are you doing?
So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing
As she went for my midsection
I threw her down as I tore off her shirt
Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work
Before I hit it she said
"3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"
I said "What is it, another nigga? It's ok"
She said "No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"
I got up out
Denaun: Hey, Maxine
Maxine: What
Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?
Maxine: Yeah for a small price
Denaun: For a small price? What you mean?
Maxine: You know, money nigga
Denaun: You don't need no damn money
I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got some shit
Maxine: (laughing) What you, what you hear I got?
Denaun: 
AIDS
Maxine: (laughing) Who told you that bullshit?
Denaun: 
My nigga Kyu
, he wouldn't lie
Maxine: Well if that's the case, Kyu got it then
Denaun: Oh for real, it's like that?
Maxine: (laughing) Well I ain't got shit
So he ain't got shit, and if he do, he ain't get that shit from me
I ain't fucking around with no 3rd nigga
Denaun: Fuck that, I ain't fucking with you
Maxine: No, see..
Denaun: You got that shit, I ain't gotta fuck with you
Maxine: Hold on, why it ain't even like that
Denaun: I want ya'll to get paid, fucking..
Maxine: (laughing as the phone hangs up)

[Intro]
Ohh, my goodness! What have I done?
Oh no (oh no) I can't believe it! (believe it)
It's like (it's like)
I've got the whole WORLD, in my palm (in my palm)
And I'm ready to drop bombs
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca
, 
Rebecca
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca
That's my sector, 
homosexual dissector
Come again, rewind
 
selector
!
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector
So you can't get pregnant if I bisexually wreck ya
Hannibal Lecter into guy sex
, 
and I bet ya
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya
They say once bitten and twice shy
Well I lie next to the guy
With nine ecstasy pills and five extra
Boxes of ribbed condoms in quantities
, why yessir
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser
That's my kind of vibe
; 
what else should I try, Lester?
Drop-kick the bitch before her second trimester
Perform the home abortion with Dexter
 then I guess I'll
Dig her fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her
[Hook]
I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
The world is just my medicine ball
, 
you're all in
I said I guess it's time for you to hate me again
Let's begin, now hand me the pen
How should I begin it and where does it all end?
My medicine ball, you're in my medicine ball friends
[Verse 2]
All my Westside bitches throw it up
Put a balloon inside your pussy
, 
queef
 
and blow it up
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sho' enough
So you better change the station to keep from throwin up
Man you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole you kiddin?
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man I do what I wanna
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna
To the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her
Imagine a visual for that man, who woulda thought I
Could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeace
But the chick's so old she looks like she out-lived a life sentence
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be,
 
you're so sensitive!
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch
With both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man
Now everybody's pissed at me - like it's my fault
His name rhymes with so many different words, jeez!
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please?
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you {*sniffs*}
Always hated you and I still do
You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume {*sniffs*}
Doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you
You're taking this shit too far {*sniffs*}
Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire
Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard
Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"
[Hook]
[Outro]
The world is mine! (the world is mine)


[Verse 1]
Once again
, 
it's the sinister cynical minister
 
Shady
Kryptonite to Superman
, 
he's a dentist to Amy
Administerer of the pain
, 
he just finished huffin' the paint
And muffler fumes like it was nothin', because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he sprays, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares, making the hairs
All on the back of ya neck stand like Dracula, yep
Spectacular rep
, 
he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yeah, Angela, so I command ya to start dancin'
Part Manson
, 
part Hannibal
, 
part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansen
Enter my gas chamber, you gangsta? My ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass
, hater
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass
He's got his face in a mask,
 your blood stains on his glass table
[Verse 2]
I'm checking the exposure of photos of me exposing
Myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off, overdosing
Windows opening, shutting; doors opening, closing
I think there's a ghost, too much hydrocodone and codeine
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink
, 
I'm standing over the sink hosing
Myself
, 
self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink
, mostly
I don't wanna think; 
this will make everything rosy
Beverly sings, 
scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in
I'm yodelling "Rosie, won't you come out to play?"
And no sense wasting time,
 
cutting and pasting headlines
In the papers, making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds
, 
I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put Nurofens in my syrup and stirred 'em
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon
, 
coke mirrors
, 
and lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy, turn him,
 
convinced that he emerged
Took over the world and reeled in all the children
Lured 'em into the building and killed 'em
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew 
and he will do what he feels
And still can spin, straw to gold like Rumplestilskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch
Mildred,
 
he's ill with it, he still shouldn't be healed
There's no one as sick as he,
 
MC's will get fricassed on the grill, then

Do to a massive amount of bootlegging
And constant downloading
People are no longer buying CDs so that we can get paid for our fucking work
They are just continuing to get songs for free
See, what they do is buy computers, strictly pick songs that they like
And burn them on CDs or put them on iPods
Causing major decrease in sound scan, putting music retail in a tremendous slump
Causing artists such as myself to make no money for record sales
Being forced to tour, causing more stress, more arguments with my wife
Not being able to see my kids, drink more, take more pills
Punch people in the face, hate the world, and end up in rehab
(Sighs) This has been a Public Service Announcement and an excuse to vent by Marshall Mathers
Not that I wouldn't have done the same thing if i could get music for free when I was a kid
But now that I rap for a living, buy my goddamn CDs!

[Intro]
Yeah
I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey, what daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier - stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin about? You got me
[Verse 1]
Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
When I'm gone
 
but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cryin, wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy ain't he?
 
yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls,
 
two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever being
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin we have no control over and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
[Hook]
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold, ya through the night
I know mommy's not here right now
 
and we don't know why
We fear how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise, momma's gon' be alright
[Verse 2]
Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me, cause daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your mom, was savin money for you in a jar
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back
On the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
Then you started seein daddy on the TV
And momma didn't like it, and you and Lainey were too young to understand it
Papa was a rollin stone, momma developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscin
Lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here
Lainie
 
I'm talkin to you too, daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment
[Hook]
[Outro]
And if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'mma give you the world
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat
, 
don't fuck with dad
Ha ha!

Baby you know I’m hurting bad, and you been on my mind since
You took away my life without warnings, without clues or even hints
You gonna always be good enough. Say you ain't and I get pissed
You once provided, but now prevent my everlasting bliss
It don’t make no sense. 
We should be together forever
No matter the weather. Circumstances worse or for better
I’m barely making it through the pain God knows how hard I'm trying
Out of all the things in this world it’s me your denying. See I’m crying. You’re lying with
“we’re not meant to be.” I’m meant for you you’re meant for me
What else can It possibly be?
An abrupt halt from what I thought what would be a sure thing
And one more thing, I wanted to buy you 
one pure ring
And be dedicated. My life would have a beautiful path
A custom mansion with kids and we could watch em grow and watch em laugh. And playing with the dog while Daddy's paying on bugattis and daddy stay selling albums. Ha, he used to be nobody
Mommy knew how great how great he was and told him “follow your heart.” And he did and got the fame even with that they didn’t part. 
Mommy whatchu want? Anything. A diamond ring? A mockingbird?
 
The greatest thing you ever gave to me was saying those two words
Snap back to reality
. The torment and the tears
Remains dormant in my mind try to realize you're not here
It’s so surreal. The pain I feel. I can’t believe it’s happening. I got all these emotions, so for those I turn to rap again

[Produced by Eminem and Luis Resto]
[Hook]
Thank God for granting me this moment of clarity
This moment of honesty - the world'll feel my truths
All through my Hard Knock Lifetime, A Gift and a Curse
I gave you Volume after Volume of my work
So you can feel my truths
I built the Dynasty by being one of the realest niggas out
Way beyond a Reasonable Doubt - y'all can't fill my shoes
From my Blueprint beginning to that Black Album ending
Listen close you'll hear what I'm about
Nigga, feel my truths
[Verse 1]
Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well
Between him doing heroin and me doing crack sales
Put that in the eggshell,
 
standing at the tabernacle
Rather the church,
 
pretending to be hurt wouldn't work
So a smirk was all on my face
Like "damn, that man's face is just like my face"
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through
It wasn't all your fault, homey you got caught
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost
My big brothers and so many others I saw
I'm just glad we got to see each other
Talk and re-meet each other
Save a place in heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Music business hate me cause the industry ain't make me
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be making
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
They criticized me for it, yet they all yell "holla"
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be
Lyrically Talib Kweli
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense
But I did 5 mill' - I ain't been rhyming like Common since
When your cents got that much in common
And you been hustling since your inception
Fuck perception. Go with what makes sense
Since I know what I'm up against
We as rappers must decide what's most important
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win
So next time you see the homey and his rims spin
Just know my mind is working just like them
(rims, that is)
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My homey Sig' was on a tier where no tears should fall
Cause he was on the block where no squares get off
See in my inner circle all we do is ball
'Til we all got triangles on our wall
Ain't just rapping for the platinum, y'all record
I recall, cause I really been there before
4 scores and 7 years ago prepared the flow
Prepared for war, I should fear no man
You don't hear me though
These words ain't just 'pared to go
In one ear, out the other ear, no!
Yo my balls and my word is alls I have
What you gonna do to me nigga, scars will scab
What, you gonna box me homey? I can dodge a jab
3 shots couldn't touch me, thank God for that
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back
And the whole BK, nigga, holla back

Intro
[Laugh]
Aye yo' Fifty
What I tell you?
We ain't even have to say shit
They did it
[Laugh]
Chorus
Monkey see, monkey do
Don't ever make the first move
Just let 'em come to you
'Cos they always gunna see and do
What the other one do
So let them come to you
The rest'll just follow suit
Monkey see, monkey do
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
If they really want it bad enough
Well then they gunna come
Now here they come
As we expected
Now we just set 'em up
Check-mate motherfucker
Games over, we won
Tweedle-dee, tweedle-dum
Verse
Doesn't take much
For me to raise such a stink up
When motherfuckers hate your guts
You ain't even got to say much
For me to put a pen to a blank sheet of paper
S'like smearing a bloodstain with a paint brush
I can’t explain what it is my brain does
But however it works
It's insane, its plain nuts
And it ain't just my brain that’s dangerous
It’s a whole combination of things
It takes nuts
And I’m not afraid to raise the stakes up
I got a million bucks in the bank
And 8 trucks
But anybody who gets on the track and spanks us
I'm patiently waiting for the day
I’m anxious
To see the look on ya fake mugs
When you thugs go bankrupt
Ya drunk
You ain't tough
Whatever you drank must of just
Turned you into some gangstas
This is me talking motherfucker
This ain’t drugs
You wanna pop shit?
Wake-up
Then make-up
FUCK THAT
It’s too late chump now
Face up
I pray for the day
That someone who spits with the caliber
That Nas and Jay does
Opens up his jaw to say somethin'
Or rattle my name off
Or rattle the first thing
From the top of his brain off
So I can blow the fucking dust off of this chainsaw
And give him the surgery that he came for
'Til I pull the paint off
I never been shot
But I think me and Fifty must of been cut
From the same cloth
Cos I’ve always came off like Ja's chain
When they try to rush him and lost
And came back
And gave him a watch in exchange for it
I don’t stop
The only thing that I wait for
Is the day I don’t have to report to probate court
Cos im'ma give ya' all a reason to hate more
Cos I been holding my tongue 'til I got a sprained jaw
Alot of rappers on my list
That just ain’t Ja
And im'ma read that motherfucker off come April
You pussies think I went soft since 
8 mile
When I come back I’ll be shooting more than paintballs
Trust me
Chorus
Outro
Fucking dumb'ens
This ain’t chess
You playin' motherfucking checkers
This shit is all day man it’s too easy
We playing chess you playing checkers
You 'bout to get your mother fucking asses jumped
Fucking punks
And by the way
We ain’t just talking to one person
We talking to every motherfucking body who wants to bring it
Cos we bring it into anybody who wants to bring it
So bring it
Don’t pick up the ball if you don’t wanna play man
It’s all fucked up now
The fuck I’m suppose to do
Huh?
The fuck I'm suppose to do
[Laugh]
Yeah we out

[Intro: Kids' voices]
I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America
And to the republic, for which it stands
[Eminem] People!
.. one nation, under God, indivisible
[Eminem] It feels so good to be back!
.. with liberty and justice for all
[Verse 1]
Mosh with me now
Scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind
, 
my insight through the mind
I exercize my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'mma whip someone's ass"
If you don't understand, don't even bother to ask
A father who has, grown up with a fatherless past
Who has blown up now, to rap phenomenon that has
Or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
Entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Who's had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
Of his career typical manure movin past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack,
 
he's a class act
Rubberband man yeah, he just snaps back
[Hook]
Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
To procede, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me, and I won't steer you wrong
Put your faith, and your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light, at the end, of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
C'mon
[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together let's all form, and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build, from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people
 
some white and some black
Don't matter what color all that matters we're gathered together
To celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yeah, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush,
 
fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home c'mon
, just
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Imagine it pouring, just raining down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office,
 someone's trying
To tell us something 
maybe this is God just
Saying we're responsible, for this monster
This coward that we have empowered
, 
this is Bin Laden
Look at his head nodding - how could, we allow
Something like this without, pumping our fist now
This is our, final hour
Let me, be the voice, and your strength, and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to amplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, 
and multiply it by six-teen
Million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach al-Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
Fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil
, 
we got our own battles
To fight on our own soil
, 
no more psychological warfare
To trick us to thinking we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizing a hero
Look in his eyes it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
And replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why - cause I told you to fight!
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
And as we procede, to mosh through this
 
Desert Storm
And these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences
, 
and assemble our own army
To disarm, THIS weapon of mass destruction
That we call our President
, 
for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak, and be heard
Mr. President! Mr. Senator!
[Over outro]
"Go left, go left, go left right left"
"Go left, go left, go left right left"
[Kids]
Can you guys hear us? *laughs*

[Verse 1: Eminem]
They ask me am I ok
They ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
Or am I just a little snappy
And they genuinely care
Doody
, 
most of my life its just been me and you there
And I 
continuosly stare at pictures of you
I never got to say I love you as much as I wanted to but I do
Yeah I say it now and you can't hear me
What the fuck good does that do me now
But somehow I know you're near me in presence
Oh I went and drop some presents off to ease it to them
Two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their minds a little
And dawg you'll never believe this
But Sharonda actually talks to me now
Jesus and everyone else is just tryna pick up the pieces
Man how could you touch so many fucking lives and just leave us
They say grievance has a way of affecting everyone different
If it's true, how the fuck am I supposed to get over you
Difficult as it sounds...
[Hook - Aaron London]
[Verse 2]
Doody, that's what we call each other
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us
We was always brothers
Never thought about each others' skin colours
Til one day we was walking up the block in the summer
It was like 90 degrees, I was catching a sun burn
Tryna walk under the trees
Just to give me some comfort
I'm moaning I just wanna get home
When I look over and your shirt is off
I'm like you gonna fry and like
"No I won't, I'm black stupid
And black people they got melatonin
In their skin, we don't burn"
Meanwhile, my face is glowing and I felt
Like I'm on fire
And the entire time you're just laughing at me
And snapping at me with your shirt, bastard
And I still have to get you back for that shit
And by the way them playboy rings
My mother stole from you
Well Nate finally got em back
Shit it must have been at least 16 years ago
Well I put em in your cask-ahhh
Moving past it, it still ain't registered yet
But you can bet your legacy they'll never forget
The 
motor city motown
Hip hop vet, hip hop shop, dreads
It don't stop there
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds...
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
And this may sound a little strange but I'mma tell it
I found that jacket that you left at my wedding
And I picked it up to smell it
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass
And hang it up in the hallway so I can always look at it
And as for all of me and 
D12
 we feel like "Fuck rap"
It feels like our General just fucking died in our lap
We shut off all our pagers
All our cell numbers has changed
Our two-ways are in the trash
So some cats will have to find a new way
And I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today
But the truth is there all still here and you ain't
Purple Gang,
 you gotta keep pressing on
Don't ever give up the dream dawg
I got love for you all
And Doody, it's true you bought people together who never
Woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you
You were the peacemaker Doody
I know sometimes you were moody
But you hated confrontation
And truly hated the feuding
But you were down for yours whenever it came to scrapping
If it had to happen, it had to happen
Believe me, I know you're the one who taught me to
Throw them balls back on 
Dresden
From making cars to paintballing
Getting arrested
To sitting across from each other in cells laughing and jesting
They tried to hit us for 5 years for that, no question
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up
Didn't show up for court
So we got off on a technicality, left sweating
Me, you and what's his face
I forgot his fucking name
Shame he even came to your funeral
He betrayed our team
And if I see him again I'mma punch him in the fucking face
And that's on Hallie Jade, Whitney Lane and Alaina's name
I let the pistol bang once just to leak a shot in the air
For you and pour some liquor out for you with Obie in the parking lot of 54
Just before we were supposed to get in cars
To come and see you once more
Difficult as it sounds

[Hook: sample of "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen]
Momma, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Momma, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
[Ca$his]
Geah, it's Ca$his, Shady Records
Real music, not fool music
There was just - a lot tears shed over what you been through
A mother's pain pays, for what her kid do
As Brian 
light fades, in the rearview
You enslaved to her, but gotta skid through
We was both bangin, Brian and I
Different neighborhoods so we chose different sides
Confrontaton in the street, so we had to ride
I won the fight, his pride felt I had to die
He screamed 1-8-7; I say, "I never hide"
You know where I'm at boy, I ain't hard to find
A couple weeks went by, we passin time
He seen me in the alley with his niggas, I
Was just dealin off Cavi then I seen the .9
Then I, heard a shot, he just kept firin
I started runnin, duckin, now I'm hidin
The whole time conscious of my own homicide and
I got away, click-click in the nick of time
His clip dropped down, he start signifyin
"You a bitch Ca$h, run with your bitch ass"
Heard sirens, then I heard him hit the gas
Right then, I knew your son wouldn't last
I said to myself, "Folk, I gotta kill his ass"
Roll through my apartment, hit the buildin fast
Gun out of my closet, hit the stick and dash
Put the, strap in my pocket, on my mission I saw him
Down the block sittin back, sippin 'gnac
I walked up like, "What's the business fam?"
He stared death in the eyes, then he shook his head
The broad he was with, shook as fuck
Put the barrel to his head, buck buck buck!
He fell to the ground, grass covered with blood
I probably go to hell for what I did to your son
I walked off slowly bugged, I ain't run
It's been five years, and no it's never over
He left me no choice, I offer you closure...
He left me no choice, I offer you closure
[Hook]
[Hook 2X: Ca$his - overlapping Hook]
Dear Ms. Jenkins, I send you my love
Hi, I'm Ca$his, I murdered your son
I'm closin the chapter, on what has begun
Dear Ms. Jenkins, I murdered your son
[Ca$his]
Dear momma, if you gettin this letter
I'm dead, I'm sorry if you gettin this letter
Wait - I'm sorry I ain't live a lil' better
My own selfish will wouldn't send you this letter
See - I had my hat cocked on the wrong spot
I threw the right sign up, on the wrong block
Blaow, blaow, bloaw! Ramone shot
Fuck a Ca$his momma! Ramone shot
It started as a fight, on a distant night
But 
far off the
 homicide, pistols tight
We still... grieve over your brother
Now you, grieve over your son - what the fuck?
He squabbed me up, this my hood
Some nigga named Ca$his from Chris' hood
He supposed to come back with iron, I ain't scared
Yes I am momma, I don't wanna be dead
But I can't run; too late, to try and change it
Born as your son but dyin as a banger
When my name gets discussed for entertainment
Never share this letter with a stranger
Please, please
[Hook] + [Hook]
[Ca$his]
Dear Brian, it's Ca$his, I can't sleep
I had to bang you, before you bang me
Just like I blame you, you could blame me
We both gave up our lives for banging (yeah)
We didn't know each other but we share the same hate
Your death is my life, so we share the same fate
This ain't what bangin was for, killin for nothin
Your death gave karma for the death of my woman
 (Monique!)
I'm tryin to make amends cause within I'm croak
But outside I'm hard, my friends don't know
I'm sorry that I killed you, I know it don't mean shit
We both could've stopped it, if we only seen shit
Happens for a reason we don't even know it
When you leave here, do you know where you goin?
I'm sendin my apologies through a song
Maybe we can reconcile when I'm gone
[Hook] + [Hook]

[Intro: Bizarre]
Detroit, Motown
Hey, guess what
They gave us a super bowl this year
And you know what happened?
[Hook]
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
Robbing, shooting, killing
Murder (Murder, murdeeeerrrr)
[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Hennyed
 
up, remied up, ski mask, black truck
Dickie outfit, passenger side (Pistol grippin' punk)
Fuck it I just did two lines
A chrome Tec-9, it'll tear out nigga's spine
It's a party, go on in an have fun
Cause after it's over all you going hear is (RUN, NIGGA, RUN! AHH!!!) *gunshots*
Shooting, blasting, hitting the floor
$10,000 in the safe, shit, I'm about to score
Cause I'm dangerous off angel dust
Shit, I'll bust, even the nigga that came with us
And this is for my niggas that be robbing an stealing
Carjacking, murder one's and fucking drug dealings
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kuniva]
I stumble in the club blowed, 9mm cocked
Something's telling me to stop, fuck it, I don't see the cops
Niggas don't believe it till they see it's out
Stupid motherfuckers want to take the scenic route, now the heater's out
Bitches scream like I pulled my penis out
Begging me to put that big motherfucker away, but the demon's out
Everybody on the floor, come out of that mink
Come out of them diamonds, and you come out of that valuer
The party is over, shut the fuck down, cut the music
Matter of fact turn it back it up, shit, I can use it
I need the noise, in case I have to let a couple off
Saw another icy chain, walked over and tugged it off
Give me that buttersoft, and since you buying out the bar
You can buy my drinks for today and tomorrow (good looking)
I'm out for the paper, my homie, better hide your jewels
I'm in the game starving and I ain't playing by the rules, nigga

* the original appears on Eminem's "Slim Shady EP" on Web Entertainment
Chorus: Eminem (repeat 4X)
It's murder she wrote (it's murder she wrote)
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked (for her to be smoked)
[Eminem]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland
 
and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's yo' lifespan
And for what yo' life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lamp in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried skatin
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register
Dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
The connection was the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King
And have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escapin the jack
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote
You barely heard a word as she choked
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked
But I slammed her on her back til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze"
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit be square in the chest, wasn't wearin a vest
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out
Blew the back end out this lady's
 
Jag
, started blackin out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yackin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car, made a profit
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window
Like the girl in "Set It Off" did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a ;ick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must-a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I musta dropped the Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE"
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me! It was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps
Chorus
Chorus (repeats again to fade)

[Eminem]
Ayo Fif, I was thinking
You should go back to doing the shit you used to do
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Murder them, murder them, if I let them demonstrate I murder them
Niggas be fronting, word up it's stunting til they heard up
Their semi talk, I let that buck, I had these niggas running hard
I pull a nigga skirt up, and have him kicking dirt up
I get a nigga hit a nigga, back up stupid hard
Silence, it's the return of the tyrants
Seein' through my third eye with both closed eyelids
Stand close to the homie you wanna die with
Flames come out the muzzle on the shit that I spit
I'm talking like the feds ain't listening
Nigga this a pool of piranhas you fishing in
I get it nigga if you want it
Better ask niggas out me I be on it
I get the drop, blow at your knot, perfect planning
Hit your back with something hot, out the cannon
[Hook: 50 Cent]
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to back put the work in
It's murder one, it's premeditated murder
Then it's another one, back to backroom workin'
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
You know I got the strap on me, bar holding that for me
I'm fucked up, it really doesn't matter though
100 9 millimeter shells in the Calico
Wait, niggas drop like domino
Run for your life puta, si, vamonos
I was taught to see my crew a long time ago
Walk around with cocaine, yeah even my mama know
I cut a O in the fo' with seven at a time
Made 4 hundred of that, you know a nigga grind
Like Cindy Lauper bitch, time after time
A nigga shine, like a nickel 9
I been talking to the man in the mirror
Nigga so ass, they be shaking like Shakira
It seems like my vision's getting clearer
See me coming with the hammer out, death is getting near you
It's funny how niggas never hear you
Till you run down on them, gun down on them
[Hook]
[50 Cent]
Yeah, starting to feel like the old me

[Produced by Dawaun Parker and Dr. Dre]
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah girl
Can you hear that, it's playing our song
Are you sleepy, take a nap
You're not afraid of the dark are ya
[Verse 1]
You hear the beat, as it makes ya not want to go to sleep
I knock on Dakota's door, it's locked so I go to creep
Round the back with binoculars,
 
not cause I want to peep
But because I'm hungry, she smells like tacos,
 
I wanna eat
Visions of hot chocolatey marshmallows, all so sweet
With sugar plums,
 
oh look here comes Marshall, he's on your street
He's placin' hot smolderin' charcoals beneath your feet
Now walk on 'em, he's dancin' with carcasses cheek to cheek
Like a Thanksgiving turkey, a holiday ham
Cinnamon sprinkled on toast, strawberry marmalade jam
Flavor my favorite graham crackers
 
with Jon Benet Rams
I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am
[Hook]
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep (My music box)
But I can hear you my love, you keep callin' me (My music box)
And when we're worlds apart, you mean the World to me (My music box)
If you call, I'll come, I will answer (My music box)
Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl’s asleep (My music box)
I hear my music box, playing a song for me (My music box)
So won’t you twirl around, and do a whirl for me (My music box)
And will you be my private little dancer? (My music box)
[Verse 2]
I almost look comatose,
 
who wants to be sober? gross
I foam like a doberman,
 
mouth open,
 
I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils, in both my holes then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged I know
I put on my mother's makeup,
 
get naked and run around
Wavin' the gun around, I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder
 
how come it rains, but the sun is out
The Devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about
Voices are leading me up to the attic,
 
I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do it's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'till I find it, I wind it up, and the tune it starts
It's playin' a song so beautiful and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I'm fixated, on asphyxiating
And breaking this little chick's neck, like a pixie stick
The sick, satan worshippin', bitches get horse whippins'
I'm in the back, through the back door slippin'
Through the crack, leavin' the corpse drippin'
The mortician of love, sent from above
Forced entry to maul when she no more stingy I've become
Been doin' this for more than a quarter century, I'm just numb
Am I dreamin', is it real? someone pinch me on the buns
The time has come, to tie her up
Gotta roll me the ladder, I've had enough of the chatter
Climb up to the window look at her
Then climb in slow to shatter, her brain matter and batter her
With a bat
 
a matter of fact that will splatter her
But before I do that, I'll have a chat to flatter her
Give her two compliments back to back
 
like Tabitha
I'm your secret admirer, I'm back to ravish ya
So strong is your fight, but you're no match for Dracula
Prolonging her plight, as I go back to stabbin' her
Dismember her limbs, simple as that, cadaver her
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back cause here comes your man, Jack,
 
so Pamela
[Hook]

[Intro]
I feel like dancing, I feel like dancing
I smell something in the air that's making me high!
I said, I smell something in the air that's making me high!
[Verse 1]
Ok, here we go,
 
Do-re-mi-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti so
Lyrical rascal, kick back the Tabasco
You motherfucker's must just not know the tick-tock, so
Time to show you the most kick-ass flow in the cosmos
Picasso with a pick axe, a sick asshole
Tic-tac-toe comes with 6-pack, with Exacto
Knives
, 
strangling wives with thick lasso
3 bags of the grass, Zig Zags
. 
I'm with the Doc, so
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones
This is poison to boys and girls who do not know
You do not want to try this at home, my lil vato
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho
So crack a 6-pack, sit back with some nachos
Maybe some popcorn,
 
watch the show and just rock slow
It's not what you expected, not what you thought so
Bout time that you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke
[Hook]
It must be the Ganja
, 
it's the marijuana
That's creeping upon me, why I'm so high
Maybe it's the Henny, that has gotten in me
Whatever's got into me, I don't mind
[Verse 2]
Your dreams are getting fulfilled oh, I'm literally getting a chill
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill
You're submitting to skill, sitting still
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama and be calmer
Bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama
Don't know if it's the
 
lala
, 
or the rum and Pepsi mama
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer
Be used as extra topping then next time I make a pizza
How many people you know that can name every serial killer
Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order
Beginning with Jack the Ripper
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped
The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate
And which model, which lake they found her
And how they attacked the victim
Say what murder weapon was used to do what on which one
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun
Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fucking night's just begun
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like
You're stuck with the same stick that you're trying to light
Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some
He can give her some, she can give them some
Get behind a LinnDrum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of
Capable of winning a Pulitzer, so unbelievable, it's a
Titanium cranium that's full of surprises
When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes
You stare into your stereos (high)
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking
[Hook]

[Eminem]
Ohhhhhh! Yeah!
So much for first single on this one
[Verse 1]
Shady's the label Aftermath is the stable
 
{*neighing*}
That the horses come out of {erra} of course we're about to
 
{stir} up
Some shit thick as
 
Ms. Buttersworth's {syrup}
It's the Mr. Picked-on-Christopher-Reeves just for no reason
Other than just to tease him, cause he was his biggest {*belch*} fan
He used to be Superman
Now we're pourin' liquor, on the curb in his, name for him
"Eminem you wait 'til we meet up again, fucker
I'm kickin' your ass for everything you've ever, said"
It goes one for the money two for the fuckin' show,
 ready, get set let's go
Here comes the buckin' bronco
Stompin' and stampedin' up the damn street like them buffalo soldiers
I told ya I'm bout to blow, so look out below,
 
Geronimo
Motherfuckers is dominoes,
 
I'm on a roll
Around and around I go - when will I stop? I don't know
Tryin to pick up where 
 left off
But I know anything's possible, though I'm not gonna top what I sold
I'm at the top of my game, that shit is not gonna change
Long as I got Dr. Dre on my team I'll get away with murder
I'm like O.J., he's like my Cochran today
We keep the Mark Fuhrman tapes, in a safe, locked them away {*slam*}
Better watch what you say, just when you thought you were safe
Them fuckers got you on tape, you swear to God you was playin'
Whether or not you was little Joshua, 
gosh I wish I could've told ya
To not do the same, cause one day it could cost you your name
[Hook]
And this was supposed to be my first single {*burp*}
But I just fucked that up so
Fuck it, let's all have fun let's mingle {*burp*}
Slap a bitch and smack a ho
This was supposed to be my catchy little jingle
 {*fart*}
That you hear on your radio
But shit's about to hit the shingle
 {*fart*}
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-no {erra}
Oh, ah {erra} oh, ah
{erra} Oh, ah {erra} oh oh ah ah
Oh, ah {erra} oh, ah
{erra} Oh, ah {erra} poo poo ca ca
[Verse 2]
{Erra erra} 
Eric swallowed some generic sleeping pills
And woke up in bed next to his best friend Derreck bare naked
{chiga chigga Jigga jigga} 
Janean just turned 16 and used a fake ID
To sneak in V.I.P. to see R. Kelly
 - 
he he he he he he
To be so young and naive
Oh what I wouldn't give to live so Kim and carefree
Paris and Nicky's parents must be so tickled they cherish every picture
With their kids with hickeys all over their necks
Hickory dickory {Dirk Diggler}
 
look at me {work} wizardry
With these words -
 
am I a jerk or just jerk chicken?
Or {chiga chigga chig chig jer chig jer} jerkin' the chain
22 jerks in a jerk circle,
 
or is it a circle jerk?
Wait a minute, what am I sayin? Allow me to run it back
And rewind it {blblblblblblblb well} let me ask you again
Am I just jerkin your chain,
 
am I berserk or insane?
Or am I just one of them damn amateurs workin the damn camera
Filmin' one of them Paris Hilton homemade pornos
Who keeps tiltin' the lens at an angle {chigga chigga}
Just recently somebody just discovered
Britney and Justin
 videotapes of them fuckin
When they were just 
Mouseketeers in the Mickey Mouse Club
 and dusted 'em
And went straight to 
The Source
 with them
Cause they could've sworn someone said
Nuh - and then tried to erase and record over it
But if you listen close enough to it you can hear the
Uhh, uhh, and then they come-to
Find out it, was-Justin sayin' "I'm go-nna cum!"
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Any opinions or somethin' you just wanna get off your chest
And address it about my lyrics I'd love to hear it
All you gotta do is pick up the phone and just dial up this number
It's 1-800-I'm-A-Dick-Sucker, I love to suck a dick
And if someone picks up you can talk all the shit you want about me
Just type in your number back and follow it by the pound key
And I'll be sure to get back as soon as there comes a day
That I fall out with Dre, wake up gay, and make up with Ray
 (hey!)
So fuck a chicken, lick a chicken, suck a chicken, beat a chicken
Eat a chicken
 
like it's a big cock,
 
ba-ca-BA-KAWK!
Or suck a dick, and lick a dick, and eat a dick, and stick a dick
In your mouth, 
I'm done you can fuck off, fucka-FUCK-OFF!
[Hook]
{*burps*}

[Intro: Eminem]
I don't know dude
I think everybody's all jealous and shit
Cause I'm like the lead singer of a band dude
And I think everybody's got a fucking problem with me dude
And they need to take it up with me after the show
Because
[Hook: Eminem]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands
Cause once I blow they know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the lead singer of my band
[Eminem]
So I get off stage right and drop the mic
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like
Sup ladies, my name's Slim Shady
I'm the lead singer in D12, baby
They're all like, oh my God it's him
Becky, oh my fucking god it's Eminem
I swear to fucking God dude you fucking rock
Please Marshall, please let me suck your cock
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes
Throw their bras and their shirts and their panties on stage
So like every single night they pick a fight with me
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry
Cause they're back on stage the next night with me
Dude! I just think you're trying to steal the light from me
Yesterday 
Kuniva
 tried to pull a knife on me
Cause I told him 
Jessica Alba's
 my wife to be
This rock star shit, it's the life for me
And all the other guys just despise me because
[Hook]
[Bridge 9X: Eminem]
My band!
[Swifty McVay]
You just wanna see a nigga backwards don't you
A-DAT? How come we don't rap on 
Pro Tools
?
Smash these vocals and do a performance
But we in the van and he in a tour bus
You don't want my autograph, you's a liar
And no, I'm Swift (oh, I thought you were Kuniva)
What the hell is wrong with our dressing room?!
Cause my shit is looking smaller than a decimal
See I know how to rap, see it's simple but
All I did was read a Russell Simmons book
So I'm more intact, tryna get on the map
Doing jumping jacks whiling get whipped on my back
[Kuniva & (Kon Artis)]
Look at Em's little punk ass thinking he the shit
(Yeah I know man by himself taking all the flicks)
Hey I thought we had an interview with DJ Clue
(Eminem: No I had an interview, not you two)
You gon' be late for soundcheck
(Man, I ain't going to soundcheck)
And our mics are screwed up (and his always sound best!)
(You know what man, I'm a say something)
Ayo Em!
 
(Eminem: You got somethin to say?!)
(Man, nothing) I thought you bout to tell him off, what's up?
(Man I'm a tell him when I feel like it, man, shut up!)
(And you ain't even back me up when we supposed to be a crew)
Man I was bout to talk right after you, I swear
(Aww man whatever) I swear, man
[Hook]
[Proof]
They say the lead singers rock, but the group does not
Went from sold out arenas to the amusement parks
I'm gon' let the world know that Proof is hot
I should cut 
his
 mic off when the music starts
(Eminem: Ayo it's..)
Ready to snap on a dumbass fan
Every time I hear (Hey, dude I love your band!)
We ain't a band bitch, we don't play instruments
So why he get 90 and we only get 10 percent?
And these guys acting funny every area code
(Eminem: Proof, carry my bag!) bitch, carry your own
Can't make it to the stage, 
security in my way
(Who the fuck are you? 
Where's Obie
 and 
Dre?!
)
[Bizarre]
God damn it, I'm sick of this group
Time for me to go solo and make some loot
I told you I made the beats and wrote all the raps
Till Kon Artis - slipped me some crack
"Lose Yourself" video I was in the back
"Superman" video I was in the back
For the media, I got some suggestions
Fuck Marshall! ask us the questions
Like who's D12? how we get started?
 
(What about Eminem?)
Bitch are you retarded?!
Anyway, I'm the popularest guy in the group
Big ass stomach, bitches think I'm cute (hey sexy!)
50 told me to do sit-ups to get buff
Did two and a half and then couldn't get up
Fuck D12! I'm outta this band
I'm gonna start a group with the real Roxanne
[Eminem Singing]
Girl, why can't you see you're the only one for me?
And it just tears my ass apart to know that you don't know my band!
(Man, fuck this!) {*punch*}
[Hook: Bizarre]
These chicks don't even know the name of my band (ha ha!)
But they're all on me like they wanna hold hands (fuck Marshall!)
Cause once I blow I know that I'll be the man
All because I'm the *mumbles*
[Bridge]
[Bizarre]
The hottest boy band in the world - D12!
[Eminem as a Salsa singer]
I'm the lead singer of my band
I get all the girls to take off their underpants
I'm the lead singer of my band
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
My salsa, 
look out for my next single it's called, My Salsa
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa makes all the pretty girls want to dance
And take off their underpants
My salsa
Where'd everybody go?

[Intro - soundclips from "Scarface"]
[Hook - 50 Cent]
My buddy, my buddy
Wherever I go, he go
My buddy, my buddy
You can run for your life, when I stick him out the window
My buddy, my buddy
I'll lay ya ass out, motherfucker, it's simple
Stay in your place I recommend
Or say hello to my little friend
[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Everywhere I go, I gotta tag along
Cause my buzz getting strong and they mad I'm on
He ride with me when I pass the mall
And wait for me on the bench when I run a game of basketball
One squeeze'll make a bastard fall, gasp and crawl
You need a bulletproof vest, mask and all
Bring your buddy when it's time to roam
Cause I got hit the last time I left mine at home
My hand bling full of platinum to shine his chrome
He even got closet space inside my home
He ain't never been broke, he glitchless
He's so reliable, I bought him a rubber coat for Christmas
Infrared beam and a scope for distance
The best company when approacing business
He will ride with me 'til the end
We all got a friend and mine is a G-U-N
[Hook]
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My buddy got a temper, he dying to pop off
Last time he did the cops had the block all locked off
Take him with me to hustle, stashed him in a trashcan
My fingertips soft, for 4 hours I bagged gram
You meet him, your destination's hell or heaven
Cause I only bring him out for that 187
He don't have a heart, I just keep feeding him shells
He get it popping in the hood, so his name rings bells
Ms. Jones stay on the 3rd floor, she called the cops on me
They came, I ran, I had to toss my other little homey
Niggas know I got new friends so they stay in their place, kid
I stay screaming on niggas and beating up baseheads
These niggas ain't thorough, they just like to pretend
Keep fucking 'round they gon' say hello to my little friend
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Young Buck]
We been through it all but yet we both still living
We been in a box but we both still spitting
And when there was beef, you even played your position
Got under the seat until we spotted our victim
At first they wouldn't listen 'til they heard you go off
Remember it was broad daylight in the middle of New York
And little did they know that we was ready for war
Bet the nigga wish he never stuck his head out the door
See whenever you come out, something happen on the block
You the reason that nigga done stopped rapping like Pac
People see you and run, and you ain't even say shit
They just know you ain't nothing to play with
You stay with sixteen homeys, and one in the hole
When the first one get out, the next one go
To know where you headed, you got to know where you been
The Glock stay with me, we friends 'til the end
[Hook]
[Outro - "Scarface" clip, gunshots]

[Intro - Television show]
Hello boys and girls!
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships
Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!
Who's your daddy?
[Hailie] Daddy what are you doing?
[Em + H] Okay then! Everybody, listen up!
[Eminem] I'm goin to hell! Who's comin with me?
[Hailie] Somebody please help him! I think my dad's gone crazy!
[Verse 1]
There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high
No plane that I can't learn how to fly
What do I gotta do to get through to you
To show you there ain't nothing I can't take this chainsaw to
[Hailie: Rahhnnn!]
 
Fuckin' brains, brawn and brass balls
I cut em off and got em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar
Inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses
With Elton John's name on my drag wall
I'm out the closet, I've been lying my ass off
All this time me and Dre been fucking with hats off
(Suck it Marshall!) So tell Laura and her husband to back off
'fore I push this motherfuckin' button and blast off
And launch one at these Russians and that's all
Blow every fucking thing except Afghanistan on the map off
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?
{*knocking*} Hailie, tell em baby - (My dad's lost it!)
[Hook - Eminem + Hailie]
There's really nothing else to say, I - I can't explain it
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)
A little help from Hailie Jade, won't you tell em baby
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)
There's nothing you could do or say that could ever change me
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)
There's no one on earth that can save me, not even Hailie
(I think my dad's gone crazy!)
[Verse 2]
It's like my mother always told me
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and Codeine
And God dammit you little motherfucker
If you ain't got nothing nice to say then don't say nothing
... Uh ... fuck that shit, bitch!
Eat a motherfucking dick, chew on a prick
And lick a million motherfucking cocks per second
I'd rather put out a motherfucking gospel record
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy
And have pussy lips glued to my face with a clit ring
In my nose
 
than quit bringing my flows
Quit giving me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meene-minie-moe
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more
Am I the only fuckin' one who's normal any more? (Dad!)
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise
At the same time, can make you dry your eyes
With the same rhyme;
 
see, what you're seeing is a genius at work
Which to me isn't work
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first
Cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek
I'd yank my fuckin' teeth
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums
Get struck by fuckin' lightning twice at once
And die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son
And walk around the rest of my life spit on
And kicked and hit with shit every time I sung
Like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl
Inside of a plane, aimed at the World Trade
Standing on Ronnie's grave, screaming at the sky
'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade
And that's pretty much the gist of it
The parents are pissed but the kids love it
9 millimeter heaters stashed in 2-seaters with meat cleavers
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither
[Hook]
[Outro - Hailie]
Ha ha ha ha!
You're funny daddy!

[Hook]
All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Makes it too late for cops to try and stop the crime rate
All I see is murder-murder, my mindstate
Murder-murder-murder and kill-kill-kill
[Verse 1]
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands
The shit is in my hands, here's your lifespan
And for what your life's worth, this money is twice than
Grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydrating
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waiting
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escaping
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied Nathan
Maybe I need my head inside straightened, brain contemplating
Clean out the register, dip before somebody catches ya
Or gets your description and sketches ya
Then connects you as the prime suspect
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet
Cause I got a daughter to feed
And two hundred dollars ain't enough to water the seed
The best thing would be for me to leave Taco Bell
And hit up Chess King and have the lady at the desk bring
Money from the safe in the back,
 
stepped in waving the Mac
Cooperate, and we can operate, and save an attack
This bitch tried escaping the jack, grabbed her by the throat
It's murder she wrote,
 
you barely heard a word
As she choked, it wasn't nothing for her to be smoked
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke
Just then the pigs bust in yelling, freeze
But I'm already wanted for selling ki's
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spelling bees
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees
I bust shots, they bust back
Hit me square in the chest, wasn't wearing a vest
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Left the house, pulling out the drive backing out
Blew the back end out this lady's Jag, started blacking out
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face
Shut your yacking mouth
Fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up
Thinking fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up
Stole her car and made a profit,
 
grabbed the tape from out the deck
And lost it out the window like the girl in Set It Off did
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimming pool
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though
Parents screaming, "Johnny go in and call the police
Tell em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace"
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff
Acting like they never seen nobody
 
hit a lick before
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64
When they sell out in stores the price triples
I ran up the block jumping kids on tricycles
And collided with an 80-year-old lady with groceries
There goes cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties
Stood up and started to see stars
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars
Barely escaped, must'a been some dumb luck
Jumped up and climbed the back of a moving dump truck
But I think somebody seen me maybe
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must'a dropped a Beanie Baby
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits
Came out with a white flag hollering "truce-truce"
And surrendered my weapon to cops
Wasn't me, it was the gangster rap and the peppermint Schnapps
[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah, look
[Verse 1]
If I woulda rap about the crap that's out, that's the route
You probably want me to take cause you're just dying to know what I think
Hear my take on some other rappers
If I was to say somethin about 
Paul Wall,
 
you'd probably crap in your pants
Cause I'm White and he's White
, so he's like 
my competition I mean, right
Nope,
 
Paul Wall is dope
, and so is 
Bubba
, so b-b-b-b-b-b
But I don't compete with nobody
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle
And dance around my opponents, do donuts
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep, it's awesome
I'm like a sleepin giant and when I awake I'm like Dre
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite prey
And sink my teeth in em and fill em, full of poison
And make a noise like a snake before I kill em
And let em know that I just don't feel em
And smack 'em with 
the backwards E on the Eminem emblem
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face 'em
Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye
, then waste 'em
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell
In the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls
For this rap game
 and it 
g-g-goes
One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three
Chk-chk one-two-three
, 
that ain't the hook
, now follow me
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"
[Hook]
My darling, I don't ever want you to leave me, 
my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
I don't ever want you to leave me, my darling
You and me were meant to be together my darling
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body
[Verse 2]
"Shady, I know you're in there somewhere, come here
Talk to me, sit, here, pull up a chair
Why don't you cut your hair? Dye it back, come on, try it"
Ahh, no! I told you leave me the fuck alone, will you?
"But I'm here to rebuild you"
 
But I already killed you!
"But Shady, we were meant for each other, think about your mother"
Yeah, so what of her?
"You think about what she did to you and your little brother
All them foster homes"
 
Fuck you mothafucka!
I had you beat! "No, I was playin possum,
 
remember?
I let you watch your little girls blossom
I gave you enough time, your soul's mine
I'm takin it back"
 You fuckin bitch, why?!
"Because I love you, look a little closer
Isn't that us on that poster?"
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
"Shady, listen (Shady!) You hear that?
They're screaming for you, I can bring your career back"
But I don't want it back "Yes, you do" No I don't
"Yes, you do, you're gonna regret it later" No I won't
"I'ma get Dre on the phone, I'll just call the Doctor"
Go ahead, I already talked to Dre yesterday
"Well I got him on the phone right now"
(Slim) You're lying! (Yo, Slim) How, why now?
What up Dre? 
(Check this out Slim, I gotta talk to you
I don't know, it just seems like
 
ever since you got off your
Drugs you became a lot softer)
But Dre, all Shady is a bottle of hair bleach and vodka
(Well, just think about it Slim, I'm here
Just hit me back and let me know what's up)
 
Fuck this
 
mirror!
"I'm not in the mirror, I'm inside you, let me guide you"
Fuck you, die you son of a bitch "Put the gun down"
Bye-bye!
 
Okay, I'm still alive "So am I too!
You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to
Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?
You remember that night 
you prayed to God
You'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you
This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right? Ooh
Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!
Oh, but you didn't know 
fame has a price too?
That you just now seeing the downside too
Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too
Ain't even sure if your kids like you
Come off tour
, 
can't even sleep at night without NyQuil
Become a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle
But together we can break the cycle, Marshall"
What?! "No one's gonna love you like I do"
[Hook]

I don't know what point exactly it started to be a problem, I just remember liking it more and more, 
whenever people would try to help me I would say get that fucking person outta here, I can't believe they said that shit to me,
 
they don't know anything about me or my life
. 
It's not like I'm out here snorting coke or shooting heroin up my arm.
It's either you have a problem and can you control it or you can't, I literally thought I could control it 
until I overdosed during Christmas of 2007
. Had I got to the hospital about two hours later, I would have died. My organs were shutting down. My liver, kidneys, everything. They were gonna have to put me on dialysis, they didn’t think I was gonna make it.
I remember coming out of rehab and relapsing and shooting right back up to where I was when I overdosed. I was ransacking my whole house just looking for a stash of Vicodin that I maybe hidden away and then I found some in my basement wrapped up it was the extra strength ones.
After I got out of rehab I did not sleep for three week straights I mean like not even nodding off for a fucking minute I would just sit up and stare at my TV.
I would walk around my house and thinking every single day, "I'm gonna fucking die." I'm looking at my kids, and like, I need to be here for them.
 
I'm growing. I just couldn’t believe that anybody could be naturally happy or naturally function or be just enjoying life in general without being on something
The doctors told me I'd done the equivalent of four bags of heroin,
I was addicted Valium, Ambien, the numbers got so high I didn't even know what I was taking anymore.
 
It never once hit me that drug addiction runs in my family
, now that I understand that I’m an addict, I definitely have compassion for my mother. I get it now.
I wanted to make an overall statement — 
I’m back
. It was a slow process. 
You gotta remember I hadn’t recorded a song sober in seven years
. 
So it took me awhile to even feel like I could record a song sober … I don’t know the last time I shot a video sober, without drinking or taking anything. It’s been years.
I almost feel like a little kid again with rap, I wanna play around with different flows. If I don’t feel like it’s what I’m fully capable of, 
if there’s one weak line, I wanna change it
. 
Rap was my drug It used to get me high and then it stopped getting me high. Then I had to resort to other things to make me feel that. Now rap’s getting me high again.
So I would say to anybody, it does get better, you know. It just does.

I never meant to bring you to my world
Now you sitting in the corner crying
And now it's my fault my fault
[Verse 1]
I went to John's
 
rave
 
with Ron and Dave
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up
With first aid tape and raped on the first date
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped using
Who love booze
 
and
 
alternative music
 
(Whattup)
Told me she was going back into using again
 
(Nah)
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen
It's better than heroin,
 
Henn
, 
the booze or the gin
C'mere, let's go in here"
 
"Who's in the den?"
[R] "It's me and Kelly!"
"My bad, (sorry) let's try another room"
[G] 
I don't trust you!
"Shut up slut! Chew up this mushroom
This'll help you get in touch with your roots
We'll get barefoot, butt-naked, and run in the woods
[G] 
Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so
 
drab
"Oh dag"
[G] What
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag"

Oh shoot, she's tripping
[G] 
I need to go puke (bleahh)
I wasn't trying to turn this into something major
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature
Susan, stop crying, I don't hate ya
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?
That ain't no reason to start wigging and spaz out
She said
[G] Help me I think I'm having a seizure
I said, I'm high too bitch, quit grabbing my t-shirt (let go)
Would you calm down you're starting to scare me
She said
[G] I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married
I don't even have any kids and I can't cook
(Hello) I'm over here Sue, (hi) you're talking to the plant, look
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late
Cause I never seen no one eat as many 'shrooms as you ate
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Susan (wait) Where you going? You better be careful
[G] Leave me alone dad, I'm sick of getting my hair pulled
I'm not your dad
, 
quit trying to swallow your tongue
Want some gum? Put down the scissors, 'fore you do something dumb
I'll be right back just chill, baby, please?
I gotta go find Dave he's the one who gave me these
"John, where's Dave at before I bash you"
[J] He's in the bathroom; I think he's taking a crap, dude
"Dave! Pull up your pants, we need an ambulance
There's a girl upstairs talking to plants
Chopping her hair off, and 
there's only two days left
Of Spring Break, how long do these things take to wear off"
[D] 
Well it depends on how may you had
"I took three, she ate the other twenty-two caps
Now she's upstairs crying out her eyeballs, drinking Lysol"
[D] She's gonna die dude
"I know and it's my fault!"
[D] My god!!!
[Hook]
[Outro]
My God, I'm so sorry!
I'm so sorry! Susan please wake up!
Please! Please wake up!! What are you doing?!

Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston
Who loves blues and alternative music (Whattup?)
Told me she was starvin, I said it wasn't a problem (Nah!)

minus the sausage
[G] I'm allergic to fungus
Come on Sue, that's nonsense
Who's at the door? Pizza man!
Who ordered pizza? Susan, it's yours
[G] Nuh uh

I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya
I'm sorry your father used to chase ya and spank ya with hangers
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out
She said
[G] Help me I think I'm havin a seizure!
I said, "You're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!"
"Would you put it down you're startin to scare me"

[Hook: Cee-Lo]
This is my mothafuckin' life
My life, oh yeah
[Verse 1: Crooked I]
Ay, S-L-A, U-G-H, T-E-R, H-O-U-S-E
Yes we are, the best in the biz
, 
the West in the bitch, this East side LB
Money over coochie, mayne,
 
645 when dip through the burbs
I be on my Gucci Mane, smash on the gas, kick a bitch to the curb
House in the hills, thousands and mill's
Getting wild in the field with your spouse in Brazil
On ounces and pills, how does it feel?
To count dollar bills that I piled off skills
Check it out, Jets fly private
Nigga S5 Hybrid, baby test drive my whip
I’m in Bed Stuy with my chick
On my West side fly shit
Pulling out minks when the weather get chilly
Left Eye side kick
Now don’t you niggas go chasing waterfalls
These bitches wall to wall and they love them Slaughter's y'all
[Hook]
This is my motherfucking life
My life, oh yeah
This is my motherfucking life
(Jets fly private, Nigga S5 Hybrid, Baby test drive my whip)
[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Sometimes I look around and I just, I just can’t believe it
I’m on a high like a falsetto, maybe that’s why I feel like I’m dreaming
My eyes just quit, look what I’m seeing
My life just shifted, I feel like I’m breathing
Light that spliff
Nah, I don’t even smoke cause it burn my throat but tonight I’m steaming
Patron in my cup, holding mine up
Toasting with a slut, that I know I'm gon' fuck
In these five star sheets, put her right to sleep, then kick the bitch out when I wake up
Even though baby girl got a large ol' ass
I remember praying that my cargo's last
Now my car so fast, I don't think you understand in a Murcielago dash
When it hurts but you ride through the dirt,
 
and you work till it hurt, and you end up on Marshall’s staff
Hoping that your granny get to see you at the Grammy’s
, 
get a call from your family that your grandma passed
Then you know what you promised her
So you stay hot as a, thermometer, dipped in lava
So proud to be part of a, conglomerate, like this
[Hook]
[Bridge: Cee-Lo]
Every time that they play this
Put your hands up high if
You're happy you made it
It's bittersweet when I say it
But since I'm alive, might as well celebrate
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
What a success story, when the film plays it gets less gory
My son didn’t know who his pop was for years, now it's less Maury
God put it there as a test for me
Used to walk around with the vest and 40
Cops tryna mess hall me
Now babes with the 34F’s adore me
I took the rock and a hard place and made the best orgy
Now the fans approach, I get paranoid
Where I’m from, they tell me never let your guard rest
But it’s simple to disregard stress
Hoes run to the bone and it ain’t farfetched
[Verse 4: Royce Da 5'9"]
Now jets fly high shit
That Panamera Porsche that’s Ryan’s fly whip
As a kid I was poor, playing tag, now I’m it!
For those of yall that don’t remember me
I’m a Detroit Oak Parker
Went from no office to offers
I told ya’ll I would get my daddy out the post office
And so far I don’t really need to own my city
Just as long as the D is on my fitted
My sons and my daughter and my wife is along for the ride
This is the motherfucking life
[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Okay, aight aight aight aight aight aight
Yo, yo.. yo, yo
Aight I'mma lay the chorus first
Here we go now
[Hook]
My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I am like I am, cause I'm like her
Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
That's why I'm on, what I'm on, cause I'm my mom
[Verse 1]
My mom, my mom
I know you're probably tired
Of hearing bout my mom, oh-ho, whoa-ho
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
And how I became hooked on Va-aliu-ums
Valium was in everything, food that I ate
The water that I drank, fucking peas on my plate
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches
Now tell me, what kinda mother would wanna see her
Son grow up to be an under-a-fucking-chiever
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothing either
What the fuck you sticking gum up under the fucking seat for
Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffing ether
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffing reefer
But all this huffing and puffing wasn't what it was either
It was neither, I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought
Pee in a teacup, bitch you ain't my keeper
I'm sleeping, what the fuck you keep on fucking with me for
Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone
I ain't playing, go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait til
I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
You little motherfucker
I'll make you sit there and make that
Retarded fucking face without even tasting it
You better lick the fucking plate, you ain't wasting it
Put your face in it fore I throw you in the basement again
And I ain't giving in, you're gonna just sit there
In one fucking place finnickin
 
til next Thanksgiving
 and
If you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit
And so what if he did
It's none of your dang business, kid
[Bridge]
My mom there's no one else quite like my mom
I know I should let bygones be bygones
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
Cause
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My mom loved Valium, now all I am
Is a party animal, I am what I am
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach
But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewing it
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it
My Valium
, 
my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohh
Man I never thought that I could ever be
A drug addict, naw
Fuck that I can't have it happen to me
But that's actually what has ended up happening
A tragedy
The fucking past ended up catching me
And it's probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb Ma, beautiful
She killed the fucking dog with the medicine she done fed it
Feed it a fucking aspirin and say that it has a headache
Here, want a snack
You hungry you fucking brat
Look at that, it's a Xanax
Take it and take a nap
Eat it
But I don't need it
Well fuck it then break it up
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
Aight Ma you win
I don't feel like arguing
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it
 
and start wobbling
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed
With a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
My mom, I'm just like her
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom
My mom, my mom, my mom

Haha, sorry mom
I still love you though

[Intro: Eminem]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X?
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me
To do war, and try to bring my crew back down
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now
[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who REALLY want they name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
And make ends meet
Now was I, blessed with a gift, or cursed with a curse?
I follow, hearse after hearse, with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let belly dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree,
 so now
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talkin, sayin my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho say my name
[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Why do you hate me? (Hate me) I came from nothin
Blood sweat and tears, you did not create me
How can you doubt me? (Doubt me) You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit (Bullshit) I struggle for survival
And now you tryin to act like my rival?
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
All the pain (all the pain) all the agony (all the agony)
All the horror (all the horrow) all the tragedy (all the tragedy)
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life? (C'mon!) One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the FUCK?! (Who the FUCK?!) you think you talkin to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in FRONT OF YOU!
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never really smashed on 
Jermaine's
 ass, 
Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I coulda been like 
Treach
, boom-bapped and slapped him
Purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I 
"Square Dance"
 
cause I'm sick of rappin circles
Around these clowns, steady tryin to call me out
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit "Ether"
(Not) I shit across your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed, I'mma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man.. {*scratched* - "Watch your fuckin mouth"}

[Outro: Eminem]
For the last time man, I'm through

Hi, my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
[Intro]
Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?
[Verse 1]
Hi kids,
 
do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight
I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
"Slim Shady, you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh!
"So why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass
 
and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut
"Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!"
I don't give a fuck
God sent me to piss the world off
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high
Thanks a lot, next semester I'll be thirty-five
I smacked him in his face with an eraser
Chased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup
Extraterrestrial running over pedestrians
In a spaceship
 
while they're screaming at me
"Let's just be friends!"
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after her
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it:
"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Stop the tape!
This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years
My palms too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang.)
I'm steaming mad
And by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
[Hook]

Fuck you niggas

[50 Cent]
You ready? Okay let me wind you up
Do it exactly the way I said do it man
These niggas is pussy you heard me?
Get up nice and close
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I put that battery in his back
I'm the reason why he move like that
That's my muh'fuckin toy soldier
I tell him pop that gat, he gon' pop that gat
You don't wanna play with my toy soldier
I say it's on then it's on until your life is over
Fuckin with my toy soldier
If youse a casualty of war, trust me I got more
You don't want it with my toy soldiers
[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Listen up close now, follow instructions
Catch a nigga slippin, run up on him and buck him
I ain't got no conscience no morals or nothin
They ain't wit us, they against us, we supposed to touch 'em
Here's what to do if you see him approach me
Pop that nigga, I don't care if he know me
Half the niggas hatin on me used to be homies
I don't trust 'em when they smile or when they frown cause they phony
Everytime I come around they call the police on me
That's why the D's in the precinct know me
They know about my rap sheet, they know 'bout how I clap heat
Run like I'm in a track meet, swift with the mac, B
You can see the envy in they eyes fo' sho' mayn
Mad as a motherfucker that I'm holdin
See me in the back of the Phantom, rollin
Quick to make examples out of niggas fo' sho' man, hold me down
[Hook]
[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Shoot, stab, kill muh'fucker
If you ain't 'bout it I don't want you around, cocksucker
Every word out my mouth is felt; that oo-wop pop
Them hollows so hot, yo' ass'll melt
Barber razor in the club, stunt - I'll give you a shape up
Have your ass stitched, gored, your head all taped up
Niggas know how I get down, see they know when I'm around
Ha ha, my soldiers around
And if some shit goes down - and a nigga get laid down
It's no surprise cause niggas know how we get down
Black tints on the Testarossa,
 hammer out the holster
Gat in my lap in case you gotta get clapped
You monkey niggas swing through my hood, we on that Gorilla shit
You clap off and miss, we come back, start killin shit
Catch us on the corner wearin black chinchilla shit
We organized, disciplined, plus we militant
[Hook]
[Interlude]
Two windows to a man's soul
... fill you with holes
Listen homey.. I'm the man for the job
So if he ain't.. (Yayo, c'mon!)
[Verse Three: Tony Yayo]
I'm in that two-door Phantom and the body's kitted
Waves in my head lookin like tsunami hit it
Niggas scheme, but the infrared beam's on the mack
I'll put green on yo' head like an Oakland A's hat
One boy was a doja, now he a soldier
My little son Dula lettin off the Ruger
In a whip masked up, lookin for his enemies
Ridin gassed up, off double D batteries
His last casualties, is hooked to them IV's
(50 gimme the word) that's when I squeeze (yeah!)
Click-clack, take that, fall back
It's a contract, 50 grand, I'm 50 man
[Hook]
[50 Cent]
Yeah! This is the general speakin (yeah)
When I say move (ha ha ha) nigga you better move
Soldier, ha ha
I don't want nobody talkin to none of my niggas
Come around here with that bullshit
Tryin to feed niggas bad information and shit
That's how my toys malfunction

[Intro]
This motherfucker, man!
Just won't shut up will you?
Talking 'bout I owe him
Bitch, you owe me... I'm promoting you right now
Yo, let's put the nail in his coffin
[Hook]
I don't wanna be like this
I don't really wanna hurt no feelings
But I'm only being real when I say
Nobody wants to hear that grandfather rap (nope)
And old men have heart attacks
And I don't wanna be responsible for that, so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity
[Verse]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
An 83-year-old fake Pacino
So how can he hold me over some balcony without
Blowing his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me?
Please don't -- you'll probably fall with me, and our asses'll both be history
But then again you'd finally get your wish
Cause you'll be all over the street like 50 Cent
Fucking punk pussy, fuck you, chump
Give me a one on one; see if I don't fuck you up
Tried to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track, that's how much you suck dick
In the industry
, 
swear that you in the streets hustling
You sit behind a fucking desk
 at The Source butt-kissing
And begging motherfuckers for guest appearances
And you can't even get the clearances
, 
cause real lyricists
Don't even respect you or take you serious
It's not that we don't like you -- we hate you, period
Talk about a mid-life crisis, damn
Last week you was shaking Obie Trice's hand
Now he's a buster? What the fuck's with that?
Get on a track dissing us, kissing 50's ass
And asking me what I know about indictments, bite me
Bitch, I got two cases and probation, fight me!
What do I know about standing in front of a judge like a man
Ready to take whatever sentence he hands?
What you know about your wife slicing her wrists
Right in front of the only thing you have in this world, a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I don't know shit about no chopping rocks
But what you know about Hip Hop Shops rocking spots
Where you the only white boy up in that bitch just ripping?
Pressing up your own fliers and your stickers, sticking
Them bitches up after spending six hours at Kinko's
Just making copies of your covers of cassette singles
To sell them out of the trunk of your Tracer
Spending your whole paychecks at Disc Makers
What you know about being bullied over half your life?
Oh that's right, 
you should know what that's like, you're half white
Vanilla Ice, spill the beans and rice
I'm eating you alive inside, Jesus Christ!
If you're that much of a gangsta, put the mic down
You should be out killing motherfuckers right now!
Kill a motherfucker dead, kill him dead, bitch!
Shoot 'em in the fucking head -- go ahead, bitch!
Slap my mom; slap the fuck out of her!
She can't sue you; she wouldn't get a buck out of ya
Cause you're broke as fuck, you suck, you're a fucking joke
If you was really selling coke, well then what the fuck
You stop for, dummy? If you slew some crack
You'd make a lot more money then you do from rap
You'll never have no security, you'll never be famous
You'll never know what it's like to be rich; 
life's a bitch ain't it
Raymond?
 Here let me break the shit down in layman's
Terms for you, just to make sure that you can understand it
And 
Canibus ain't using too many complicated fucking words for you
Here let me slow it down for so you could understand if I say it slower
...let it go dog, it's over
[Hook]
[Outro]
Haha... talking 'bout, I have motherfuckers calling your crib
Bitch, you ain't even got a fucking crib!
You ain't even got a fucking phone... fucking bum
Threatening to shut me down at ya lil' fucking Source magazine
If I come back when did I attack you?
BITCH you attacked me first take it like a man and shut the FUCK UP
Fuck your little magazine too
I don't need your little fucking magazine
I got 
XXL
's number anyways
And y'all can't stand it cause they getting bigger than y'all
Oh, and by the way... 
how'd I look on the VMA's?
When you was watching me from whatever fucking TV you was watching me from
From Boston...
the mean streets of Boston
Fucking sissy, and you got us scared up in that motherfucker?
Suck my motherfucking dick
Oh! And for those that don't know
Don't get it twisted y'all
The Source has a white owner!

[Intro]
Eminem: Denaun, what up man?
Denaun: What up dawg?
Em: Ya alright?
De: Chillin', cold as hell
Em: Yes it is, hey bus didn't come here did it?
De: No, hey look, you got fifteen cent?
Em: Nah, I got just enough to get on the bus, I'm broke
De: We gotta go to the store alright man quick cause I'm short
Em: Yeah, we gonna have enough time to go to the store?
De: Nah, look
Em: You should just, how much you got there?
De: I only got 75, I'm sure I got a dollar, know what I mean
Em: Just throw it in there they ain't gonna know
You know what aye look, I'm sick of taking this damn bus everywhere man
De: You gotta make some moves or something
Em: I know, look, 
I'm trying to get rich
I got a baby on the way
, I don't even got a car
You know what I'm saying?
De: I still stay with my moms, 21 and still with my moms
Em: Yeah look hey, we gotta make some hit records or something
You know what I'm saying? Cause I'm tired of being broke
[Verse 1]
Cause all I do is yearn a life without a concern
And dream of having a turn to earn money to burn
Mapping out my strategies to get rich huh
My desire is like a scratch that needs to get itched huh
Cause man I live in the D
, this shit ain't given for free
Nothing's different to me, so what, it's easy to see
I'll be the prisoner to flee, from all of this misery
I'm not wishing to be another fish in the sea
But just an MC, so listen to me, but if you disagree
You missing the key, you ain't even in the vicinity
Unconditionally my aspects to cash checks
My objects were never to swab decks
It's up to you the decision is yours
If what you vision is tours, or a missionless course
When your shit is in the stores, cause you can be a star
[Hook]
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh, cause you can be king
You can rule the world, you can do anything
It's on you baby, cause you can be a star
No matter wherever you are, you're never too far
From revenue huh
Em: You know what I'm saying, see what I'm talking about man?
Cause that's it. Yeah. A million dollars ain't even that far away man
De: Yo we got to get the money man, I can't be broke for the rest of my life
Em: Yeah I hear what your saying. Look there's got to be something better, you know what I'm saying?
De: I can't live like this for the rest of my life man, bumming rides everywhere I go
Em: Yeah, what's up with Lexus and Land Cruisers?
[Verse 2]
Yo I'm not about to chance it and dismiss handling business
I'm canceling Christmas to gamble and risk this
Financial interest is the matter at hand
I got an adequate plan for stab at a grand
I grab what I can and do what I must
Pursue what I lust, 
it's true that I just choose
The few that I trust, thems the people that I still got
Fuck with gangsta fill pot, get your grill shot
The 5 Ela for life my man Thyme
Proof, Kyu and Denaun, we move through into time
My crews true and divine, we never fronted
We just wanted to be funded, and live to be a hundred
Instead of hunted or being wanted as fugitives
It's all about a man planning what his future is
What he can do for his to be a star
[Hook]
[Outro]
That's what I'm talking about, I'm not trying to be the player
I'm trying to be the man, I'm want to be president
Yo forgot that president man 
I'm trying to be king
Making dead presidents, you know what I'm saying?
Yeah
Getting money any time I want owning my own businesses and all that
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I'm trying to be a millionaire man, hahaha, but don't all you know
You only live once
'96, baby

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's not much you could do or say to phase me
People think I'm a little bit crazy
I get it from all angles,
 
even occasionally
 
Doc Dre-zie'll
Have to step in every once in a while to save me
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
If they heard some shit, I'd lay the tape 'fore they erase me
I may be a little too fast paced and racy
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me twenty times
Cuz I say so many rhymes, it may seem like I'm goin too fast cuz my mind is racing
And I could give a fuck
 
what category you place me
Long as when I'm pushing up daisies and gone
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
When I hit the heavenly gates
 
I'll be cool beside Jay-Z
For every single die hard fan who embraced me
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
Believe it or not, I thank my mom for how she raised me
In the neighborhood daily, they jumped and chased me
It only made me what I am today, see
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
You ain't gonna make or break me
Tryna strip me of my credibility and make me look fake, G
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
Cuz sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
And when you face me with all the shit you've been saving to say to me
You had all this time to think about it
Now don't pussy out and try to about face me
Cuz I've been Patiently Waiting
 
for the day
That we finally meet in the same place to see
[Hook x2 - Nate Dogg]
No matter how many battles I been in and won
No matter how many magazines on my nuts
No matter how many MC's I eat up
Ooh ooh, it's never enough
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
My flow's untouchable now you gotta face it
Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
You go say the wrong shit and get your face split
The smell of victory, love it so much I can taste it
I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit
Graze it, 
your peace talk, save it
You shit sounds dated
, you're overrated
I'm obligated to study your moves then crush you mutherfuckers
If I'm the best and the worst, then God's gift is a curse
Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
I spit shit, slick shit, so quick you miss it
To be specific I go ballistic as hieroglyphic
My music is a drug
, press play, 
you ain't gotta sniff it
Chew it or pop it, roll a bag or chop it
Get your high over and over, but you gotta cop it
When it's hot, it's hot
Your hatin' is undeniable, stop it
[Hook x2]

[Verse 1]
Yes I understand I done came a long way
From huggin them corners to appearin on TV
From choppin up nicks like this here feeds me
To makin 'em hits like this shit's easy
But it's not, it's a whole lot of bullshit involved
And truthfully, I'd rather be bullshittin with y'all
But I gotta chase the donuts, Cocoa's growin
And it's like "Oh shit, she was just born"
And now she knowin every song on the radio
If I hear another Bow Wow quotable (Oh no)
Grown as ever, school craft for ever
Recognize real when I stare at ya, my niggas
I'm a hold ya down, even when I'm not around
I'm just gone for now, I'll be back in a while
Back in a while, yes (Said I'll be back in a while)
[Hook]
My niggas Koon and G, never forget ya
John Doe, I will never forget ya
Jo Jo, I will never forget ya
P-Funk, how could I ever forget ya?
Terry T, I will never forget ya
My man B, I will never forget ya
Strafmoore, Obie will never forget ya
Lauda, how could I ever forget ya?
[Verse 2]
This is dedicated to my chick friends
Never stuck in my dick in friends, just my down ass bitches
You know who you is like you know how
To get a sucker mothafucka's riches, y'all ain't shit
And when I touch back home, nigga find me a bitch
With a fat ass, and no I ain't dyin a trick
That's asinine, I'm on the grind and I'm tryin to get rich
All this a mine so y'all got some, get your wigs did
My ridettes from East to West
North to South, stab a bitch for runnin her mouth
Five rugrats, 
big gun in the house, you run up in
You get stretched up out without a doubt, it's vicious
This go out to all my tataliciouses
Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about
[Hook]
Big homie Creda baby, never forget ya
Little Meeko, never forget ya
My sister Zata, never forget ya
Nikki, I will never forget ya
Nigga Cat, how could I ever forget ya?
Jim Brown, I will never forget ya
Young Bratty, how could I ever forget ya?
Keena Johnson, I will never forget ya
[Verse 3]
And now that the album is sold, the story unfolds
Cause I'm probably asleep on your living room flo'
Whether gold or plat, O. Trice
Always knows to go back, pass the Carnac
Crash the Cadillac, nigga ain't shit changed
Just a lot a change, a whole lot a brain
A whole lot a dates, a whole lot a thang
But hey I'm from the D, I got a whole lot a game
And I promise, I'm as thorough as you made me
Detroit living, 
I'm in thoroughly with Shady
I make moves 'til them fools come engrave me
They crazy, the pistol was cocked, he won't play me, yeah
[Hook]
Rest in peace my nigga Lou Green, I will never forget ya
Little Randy, I will never forget ya
Keith, I will never forget ya
Shawn Stringer, I will never forget ya
Little Randy, how could I ever forget ya?
My nigga Shan, never forget ya
All my niggas that's gone, never forget ya
I love ya'll, it's on never forget ya
[Outro]
Yeah, Shady baby! Detroit motherfuckers (313 baby)
That's right, we in here, know what I mean? (Never forget ya)
I've been seein the struggle my nigga
I'm rest to go, the color ain't purple, the color is green
Let's get this money, Hop-o, yeah, momma, right here

{"Niggas!"} Yeah.. uh..
{"Niggas!"}
[Verse One: 2Pac]
Who's afraid of the punk police?
Niggas run the streets, no justice no peace
Fuck the law, I'd rather draw than do time
Don't fuck with mine 'cross the line
My two 9's go BIYA BIYA when I shoot 'em
Korean motherfuckers was crooked
So niggas had to burn and loot 'em
Now the streets ain't safe at night, my niggas
.. uhh, straight take his life
So don't sleep when my team creep up
, 
how we hit 'em
Empty the clip, then dip cause we did 'em
Lickin off shots for Latasha, that's proper
Love for my niggas but a Glock for the coppers
So what the fuck you wanna do now?
I packed a 9 last year, in '99 I'm packing two now
And even if they pull they triggers
They can shoot one man, but nothing's gonna stop the plan of true niggas
[Hook]
{"Niggas!"} Yeah, niggas - can't fuck with us
{"Niggas!"} Yeah, niggas
Cause bein a nigga means you love niggas, haha
{"Niggas!"} I was raised in this society so there's no way you can
Expect me to be a perfect person, cause I'mma do what I'mma do
[Jadakiss] HA!!! Uhh..
Aiyyo!
[Verse Two: Jadakiss]
My dimes make the fiends go to sleep, so they call 'em Bedrocks
Niggas is like photographers, all they take is headshots
Your last words'll be, damn, what's all these red dots?
Niggas nowadays they worry me
My bars is therapy, as long as you usin 'em thoroughly
Muah 'til the day that they bury me
My niggas is stronger and tighter now than they probably ever be
And I'm a product of the 70's
The hood got niggas on punishment, that's why they never leave
If I ain't eatin wit'chu I'm probably beefin wit'chu
If no money ain't involved ain't no need for me speakin wit'chu
I know you got a gun but I'm hopin you keep it wit'chu
Cause unfortunately I'm one of the rappers that keep a pistol and
Know what the llama do
, 
Shady/Aftermath
Ruff Ryders, D Block, and of course Amaru
Lot of people honor you, probably cause the way
That you used to bring the drama to, whoever you wanted to
You a leader when you can get a leader to follow you
But, anyway, life goes on
So I'll see you when I art in heaven like our fathers do
[Hook]
{"Niggas!"} Nigga! Can't fuck with us

[Verse 1: Eminem]
In my mind I'm a fighter,
 
my heart's a lighter
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up
An arsenic writer,
 
Author with Arth-r-itis
Carpel-tunnel
, 
Marshall with start shit-itis
Hard-headed
 and 
hot-headed
Bull-headed and pig-headed
Dick-headed a prick, a big headache I'm sick
Quick-witted for every lyric spitted
There are 6 critics who wait, for me to slip with it
So quick this dynamite stick, bury the wick
It's gonna ex-plode any minute
, 
some lunatic
Lit it and it's not Nelly
, 
do not tell me to stop yelling
When I stop selling I'll quit
 
so, stop dwelling
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready
Cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly
This is destiny
, 
yes money
I'm off running, so get off of me
I'm not slowing or softening
[Hook]
No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry
You can all sue me
; 
y'all could be the cause of me
No apologies, y'all feeling the force of me
No remorse for me, like there was no recourse (nah) for me
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all
Till I get a call that God's coming
No apologies, laugh fuckers, its all funny
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me
No apologies
[Verse 2: Eminem]
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows
But these cellos, help just to keep me mellow
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows
I'm hunched over emotion just flows over
These cold shoulders are both frozen
You don't know me
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs
I choke mics like asphyxation
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating
Fuck yeah I'm a basket case
And I mastered this rap shit till my ass gets wasted
Till my assassination, till I'm slain cuz of some fags infatuation
.44 Mag's fascination a taste for disaster and if that's the case then
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
This song isn't for you it's for me
A true MC, it's what he'll do
Just to see if he still has it
And if his skills mastered
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed
 
that's a
Real MC got you feeling me
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree
As long as there's still this hunger, and will in me
Then expect a longer life expectancy
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't had this outlet to salvage me
Inside, I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing
And mourning so I'm warning you don't coax me
It's silly, I’m really a sheep in wolf's clothing
Who only reacts when he gets pushed don't be
Fooled,
 
the press blows up this whole thing
It's stupid, they don't know cuz they don't see
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it
I'm sick of talking bout these tattoos Cartoon did
That's why I tuned it out I'm sick of duking
They can suck my dick while I'm puking, and you too you can
[Hook 2]
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies
Expect no sympathy from me
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be
Cold as a G, my heart's frozen it don't even beat
So expect no apologies

[Intro]
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, ugh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go 'round fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun,
 
semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away,
 
man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
[Hook: Eminem and Lil Wayne]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)
That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)
You show me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)
That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you
Get 'em
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can, see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em
They call me a freak cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute
Yeah that rap was tight
But I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
My soul started to rot, fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow
'til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop
I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it
Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment, I'm 'bout to blow
You'll never take my pride,
 
killing the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentless,
 
I smell blood
I don't give a fuck
: 
keep giving 'em hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up
You get no love
[Hook]

[Intro]
[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, ugh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go 'round fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found
[Hook: Eminem and Lil Wayne]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now

(I ain't got any love)
(Is not my falt)
(Are womans)
(Is just break my heart)
(Fall in a part)
(So what I have to do now)
(Get back up)
(It so hard)
(I will be up)
(One day the world)
(Will see me now)

And I don't need you
(Get 'em king)
[Verse 1: Ruben King]
The king is back again
More than fast and furious playing this life again
I'm just seeing these bitches ruling over my kingdom again
I was little bit piss, more than pissing in the lake
Whatta else these fucking haters wanna take 
my pancakes
Like 
Jay Kennedy
 took them and cook them
Put them some of them in the briefcase so he could eat them later night
What else I was looking for, huh?
But I ain't found any true love ha
Look at me now still the same king
I ain't worried about anything
But many people say the same shit
I was not a talented kid in the school
But I show them who is real talented in the talent show ha
I guess many chicks liked me on that day
But the one I loved, she started to fucking hated me
Many girls call me a freak cause I acted like a creep in front of them
I was not funny like
Big Sherman
Everybody thought I was shameless kid in the school
Dude never gonna be famous
I was not a aimless
Still working so hard in my hip hop career
I'm not going so hard
Sometimes my hates try to steal my throne away
I was not fighting for any freedom
I just want my kingdom back
You are talking about my life
Whenever I feel for a woman I felt no love
But bullshit fool me around

[Intro: Trick-Trick]
You know what the days of talkin is over
It ain't too much mo' we can say
To try to get these, different individuals
Or motherfuckers as I like to call 'em
To just, shut the fuck up
Let's go
[Trick-Trick]
You witnessed the ass whoopin, bones got broke
When the .50-cal blast, couldn't last through the smoke
As you choke, pay attention, bear winess to this motherfucker twitchin
You excited cause none of the bullets hit you, they missed you
And we ain't trippin, wasn't after you
But you PISSED, just like a bitch when niggas laughed at you
Now you agitated a little bit, actin just like a little bitch
I figured that you would surface and knew you happened to manage to pop shit
Sayin "Trick that, Trick this"
When the balls that you had left when I popped him
You shoulda died with him, body and soul coulda burned
I'ma keep killin these bitches 'til everybody learn
FUCK time, and it's time these fuckers just start dyin
I ain't sayin this for sake of this rhyme, and I ain't LYIN
I'm man enough to say it and mean it, niggas can be gone
I'ma do another verse but it ain't much more I can SPEAK on!
[Hook: Eminem]
There's nothin more these words can say (can say)
This hard-headed motherfucker just won't let it lay (let it lay)
So say a prayer for this player cause he's goin to his grave (to his grave)
So stand clear, bitches better get the fuck out my way (my way)
[Proof]
Let me show you how I started as a starvin artist
This is Proof with the truth regardless of all this (for real)
As my CEO and best friend of the essence
Of why nobody in Detroit wan' test him (huh?)
Lesson learned, flesh get burned
Tecs in turn, a scar harder than a press and burn
Everlast the beef is over, you can sleep this over
Clique been filled the streets with soldiers
Includin me, I move and creep with uzi fleets
That choose to lead, 
I'll put your dudes to sleep
Who is he? (Trick!) Trick, no treat
That street life, AK that still'll lift your feet (blaow!)
The rest of these niggas is comical, I'mma go abominable
Split like a domino, rhymin' pro
Shine without a diamond, go Geronimo to any man with balls
Murder you bitches, still screamin' "FUCK the law!"
[Hook]
[Trick-Trick]
Since talkin about it is considered as conversation
Then I'm more than HAPPY to be the sponsor of demonstrations
From beatin these cases to bustin in faces and bustin these K's
Niggas gon' act like they don't wanna act right
FUCK THAT! Had to begin settin the trend
Of organizin a mob, and bringin it to an end
The levels of toleration'll cease, for givin passes
That's why my reputation precedes for beatin asses
Entertainers, they take it as a joke and they tend to provoke
An up-and-comin undergrad; motherfuckers got me mad
Fuck it, I'mma give it to 'em if you really gon' do 'em
If this motherfucker even BLINKS, put a clip into him
Don't even think of negotiatin a treaty
The reason most of these niggas is hatin is cause they greedy
Uncovered another man's SHIT, now that's a real bitch
Now the NEXT motherfucker gon' DIE, that's IT!
[Hook]
[Outro: Trick-Trick]
Kill one of you bitches

[Intro: Bizarre]
Yeah...ha ha ha (BANG!), Yeah, 
Bizarre Kid
 coming at you
Eminem and Fuzz, and Mr. Swifty, ha ha
No one's iller than me (what)
No one, no one is iller than me
No one is iller than me
It's Mr. Swifty
 
from the 313
[Verse 1: Swifty McVay]
I make rappers wanna turn into singers
I keep hoes licking they fingers
Bring this competition and face this meaning
Got your whole crew doing subpoenas
Hell nah you ain't seen a crew genius
Murder whoever's between us, pack your heaters
Keep it close, you can't beat us
While your whole crew treat us like G's, you best believe this
I done made quadriplegics outta these non-rapping rejects
While the whole world ejects your tape
It ain't no secret that your shit sounds fake
You can't stop it my mind state
Makes it too late for cops in trying to stop the crime rate
I'm like toothaches, 
I'm painful to rappers then you can tell
From these shells, how I gotta bend 'em like root canals
I erase all trails, something farther from getting bail
Makes you wanna kill an emcee yourself, you might as well
Be within a 25 to life sentence, on linking trials
Horrified, and keep on fronting, repenting and lose they bowels
Everything is foul when Swift's around, vacate now
Niggas dumb enough to try to front and escape, how?
I'm gonna take this 'gnac and drink it straight wild
Niggas steady falling in my face like milk crates, BLAAAOW
It's Swifty from the 313
Like I said no one is iller than me, unnhh
[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Me and Eminem and Mike
Driving down Van Dyke
Get my dick sucked late at night by a fuckin' transvestite
Still on probation for strangling my boy Jason
Should be taking my medication, it's 9 to 10 I'm facing
Last week this old man I had to blast
Cause he tried to help me out when my car was out of gas
Ripped this old lady, hung her neck by a hook
Didn't realize it was my grandmother 'til I checked her pocketbook
Fuckin' with the white boys got me back on crack
Better explain where the hell your TVs and VCRs is at
I done lost 100 pounds, I ain't been eating like I should
This wounded dog in the street is sure looking good
Rob this little boy in his fucking paper route
Throwing bombs at day care centers and yell "Everybody get out!"
My girl beat my ass and shot me in the back with a 2-piece
Cause she found out I was having an affair with her 10-year-old niece
No one, no one's iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Bizarre Kid straight from the 313
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Nobody better test me, cause I don't wanna get messy
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dipped freshly
New Lugz,
 give the crew hugs,
 
guzzle two mugs
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs
Whipping 40-bottles like the fucking Pepsi clubs
Down a fifth, crack open a six
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss
I'm hollering at these hoes that got boyfriends
Who gives a fuck who they was?
I'm always taking someone else's girl like Cool J does
They probably don't be packing anyways, do they, Fuzz?
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz
Mics get sandblasted
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid
Sprayed your motherfucking crib up when I ran past it
Fucking felon, headed to hell in a handbasket
Talking shit'll get you, your girl and your man blasted
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic
Furious four motherfuckers
Flashing in front of your face without the Grand Masters
Slim Shady
, ain't nobody iller than me
[Verse 4: Fuzz Scoota]
I run shit like an ass with legs
Massive lead to leave your cabbage red
Similar to your ass in a casket dead
Drastic spread of acid heads
Come to abort you like a bastard egg
That trash you said got you standing on plastic legs
Ask the feds from past the edge
Rocking the most classic threads
Flashing bread, roll down the window
Bitch you got some fantastic legs, you can get 'til that ass get red
You can get 'til that ass get red
Bizarre you get him and him, Swift you get him and him
I'll get him and him, leave the other two for my nigga Eminem
Never writer's block, I block writers
My block's tighter, ante up and get your top fighters
Got fired for jumping the counter with a mop stick
Some bitch ran up screaming, "GET THE COPS, QUICK"
And got drop kicked, now she screaming "stop it"
Got clips to stop shit, rock shit and grab this hot shit
Wherever you shop bitch, Fuzz Scoota '97 crop pick
Sick-a y'all niggas looking at me like I got tits
I shoot a rocket through your optic
You niggas still don't know the top pick
I got bricks
, 
lose my foot in your ass
And have you shitting socks bitch
P Rock shit,
 leave your fucking knot split
Grab the green from Al by showing him hot grits (no one)
Ain't nobody iller than me
[Outro: Bizzare]
It's the Mr. Fuzzy from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Eminem and Swift from the 313
No one, no one is iller than me
It's Fuzz and Buzz-arre from the 313
You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees
From the home of potholes and trash
We'll lyrically blast

[Produced by S1]
[Hook: Adam Levine]
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man their emotions change so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on
They turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear em it may sound like it's some other shit
Cause I'm not writing anymore
They not making hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doing what I'm supposed to
I'm a writer, I'm a fighter
Entrepreneur, fresh out the sewer
Watch me maneuver
What's it to ya
The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid, getting your buzz heavy
I was in the fucking shed sharpening my machete
Sipping on some of that revenge juice
Getting my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even
I think you fucking meatballs keep on just forgetting
Thought he was finished, motherfucker it's only the beginning
He's bugging again, he's straight thugging
Fuck who he's offending
He'll rip your vocal chords out
And have them bitches plu~gged in the
Motherfucking wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em
Then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets
Cause I thought you might finally fucking see
That'll teach you to go voicing your cocksucking opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit
Fuck letting up, you’re gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me
Feels like I'mma snap any minute, yeah it's happening again
And I'm thinkin' about just saying
Mother fuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50
Cause this is all I know
This is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But everytime I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble
Oh I guess it's bubble wrap
It's like a vicious cycle
My life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did
Feels like I'm going psycho again (shh, shh, shh, shh)
And I might just blow my lid
Shit I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
Cause I'm running in circles with
[Hook]
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I haven't been this fucking confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 AM in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers,
 
I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get your ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic pussy
Now pick the casket, dirt nap with the maggots
It's tragic, it's sad it's
Never gonna end, now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it
This a gift God-given, like the air in the lungs
Of every fucking thing living
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Ecstasy in the air
I don't care
Can't tell me nothing
I'm impaired
No words for wear
[Hook: Rihanna]
(Let the champagne splash
Let that man get cash)
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
I'm going numb, I'm going numb
[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Can’t you see
Ain’t it clear
I don't care
Get closer to me
If you dare
I double dare
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
I’m plastered (Dry wall),
 
look me in my (Eyeball)
Do I look high? (No!),
 
I love the way you lie girl
Yeah, yeah, yeah, come here dear, trying to get closer to you
I'm motioning you to pull over boo
I'm the siren that you hear, I'm the butt police
And I'm looking at your rear, rear, rear
But odds are I'mma end up in the back of a squad car
By the end of tonight, I'm a rock star
Get your wind up, it's attack of the Oddball
Homie can you show me where the gosh darn bath salts are
Cause I'm sick of sniffing asphalt
Every thought scarred
 
got my pants off at the crosswalk
In suspenders
 
and I can't feel my limbs cause
[Hook]

[Intro: 
Linkin Park
 & 
Jay-Z
 and 
Eminem
]
Yeah, Thank you thank you thank you, you're far to kind!
(Look, if you had, one shot)
Whoo! Aha, uh, whoo, yeah! ready? whoo!
Whoo, Whoo
(In one moment)
[Hook: Jay-Z & 
Chester Bennington
]
Now can I get an encore, do you want more
Cookin raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar(Look, if you had, one shot or one opportunity)
Uh uh uh uh
Now what the hell are you waitin forrrr!!!(To seize everything you ever wanted)
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga make some noise(Would you capture it, or just let it slip?)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo!!
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs
 
but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down
, 
the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out
He's choking, how
Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over - blaow
Snap back to reality
Oh - there goes gravity
Oh - there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that, but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to this 
, that's when it's
Back to the lab again yo this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Hook 1]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
[Verse 2: Eminem]
The soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
This 
 for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a 
 Order
A 
 is boring; but superstardom's
Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over
These hoes is all on him, 
 shows
He's known as the Globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada. And so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on: da-da-dum da-dum da-dah
[Hook 1]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
No more games, I'mma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my family, cause man, these 
Food stamps don't 
, and there's no movie
There's no 
, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter
Caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby momma drama, screaming on her too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option - failure's not
Mom, I love you but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet: fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got
You can do anything you set your mind to, man
[Hook 1]
[Outro]
(Can I get a encore? Do you want more, more, more, more)
I've, become so nuuuummmmbb!
(So for one last time I need y'all to roar!
One last time I need y'all to roar!)

[Hook?]
You know what you're doing when you do it for the ladies
So won't you please step up to the mic baby?
[Verse]
It's been a little boring lately
I've been playing in poison ivy and pee
I've been itching to get in some S-H-I-T
You heard what I S-A-I-D
This club? I guess they I.D
But they just let me in without it so I guess they like me
I put on my best dang white tee

Ayo, Em
Did it again
[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK
, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play
[Verse 1- Lloyd Banks]
Nah, I can't play sax or pull a rabbit out a hat
But I can cock back and blow your bladder out your back
Take that, I'll show you niggas how to rap
I'm crack, that's snowy white powder on the track
I told 50 I was going to take it to the top
Get close and get pop like hot bacon out the pot
And my goonys are loony and strip you naked on the spot
Ain't nobody scared in south, Jamaica but the cops
And speaking' bout cops, you niggas better stop quelling
And if I get knocked, I'll make bread on your head by the million
Call up the {Bin Laden} tell hims {Taliban} the building
On a {Sunday} so they don't {blow up} the Children
[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play
[Verse 2- Lloyd Banks]
I roll up cause it's a hold up
Ain't nothing funny stop smiling
It be the reason the crowd piling
Don't complain and die over a chain
Bang bang gang green neighborhood game
You know me I'm slipper as them baggy sweets
I throw a bitch out the crib like Jazzy Jeff
All the hate is sidelining and they mad he next
Cause I got the bunny's with them fatties yes
My ride thumping, talking shit, stunting
It will be repeated thumping if my finger push the button
Just for bluffing, hit for nothing
You can bust him, it don't matter the vehicle custom
[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play
[Verse 3- Tony Yayo]
I'm from New York, New York niggas die for the cheese
I air your house out like a can of fabreeze, at ease
Ease up soldier, I pull up in the rover
Click clack, ya whole life over
Baking soda in your work they gon' buy it? nope
Cause them fiends getting tired of that diet coke
I'm back baby, mad hype like a crack baby
Ask Slim Shady, my gun game crazy
[Hook-Lloyd Banks]
Don't talk tough talker unless you walk the walk
We grimy, we dirty in New York, New York
Blood spill around here and don't care about court
Take a pack and bring it back and don't come up short
Cause any day can be your day, so don't play
Yay got the yay, Fame got the AK, OK
You scared, get the fuck out the way
And pray, them G-Unit boys don't play

[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, play that shit
What the fuck you doing Stretch
Gotta stretch your neck
You better protect it
I’mma inspect today
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ho, ho
[Verse 1]
Where’s my words at
Yo see Slim Shady yo, where the birds at
Me and Flip the middle ones
Rappers get these little ones in they mouth
These little nuts, yeah
Shit, I don’t care I ain’t afraid to admit it
I got a little dick yeah, but so do you
You scared to admit it
You won’t spit it on this mother friggen mic
Cause I will strike and smack your ass like a friggen fag
And I don’t care if you get offended
I never pretended to rock this microphone beef
You wanna start it now we’ll end it
Cause when I slip in the zone up on this microphone
People want me to do a written rap but fuck that go home
I don’t really give a damn I’ll kick right off of the top
And everything that I drop always gonna remain hot
Let on the spot, Slim, I mean woops, Grim it’s when im dim
Yo, I’m in affect mode
Rappers get they neck sewed
Get they whole threshold fucked up
Get they game presto
Ha, ha
I busted, I kill it, I crush it, I do it, the fluid, I spill it, I’m ill wit
These motherfucking rhymes that I be coming with there running with me
Kick you in the motherfucking stomach shit
Cause you don’t want none of it
Rappers always try but they always die
And rappers always stuck to me and tried to lie
(Arf, Arf)
Yo, where my dogs at
Yo (err, ribbit) where my frogs at
In the house, It really doesn’t matter cause I still turn it out
When I step on this mic, smacking your spouse
Ha, Ha
The illest MC to come off the top
When I get this drum off
Yo Strech give me a break, let me catch my friggen breath
And till` the death, bust rhymes till` there’s none left
I’m wanted for theft and robbery
And probably smack a bitch up in the lobby G
Cause she don’t want none of me
I’m the illest MC to ever hold a cordless on the planet earth and you’ll see
That I’m from the friggen D
Ya’ll don’t get my point I’m from Detroit
Smoking fake grass like a joint
That’s the first simplest rhyme I ever said in my life
But, at the end of the night I’ll still be fucking your wife
Shit, I really don’t care your style needs to switch
Cause you ain’t rich, that’s why you ain’t rich
Remain underground, can’t come off the top
You can’t drop rhymes nonstop like this
I might twist my friggen dick up in your ear
Rappers always wanna stand clear
I’m a motherfucking landmine
Ya’ll don’t understand mine
I’m Slim Shady showing out like my tan line
Ha, ha
The illest MC to rhyme
Every time the illest MC of our time
I rhyme time and time twice but I’m nice
With this mic device I slice right through your Adams apple
I had a Snapple and a motherfriggen syringe
Up in the bathroom I shouldn’t have but yo I boinked
To any MC up in this shit who want some
To any MC who wanna step up and get some
Get done, fuck competition
Let me catch my breath one more time
Yo, I’m on a mission
To stomp any MC comp I just trunked
And swamp is this truamp a word?, no its not
Yo, but here I go with this lyrical, lyricols, spiritual flows, that I slow
Driving MC’s crazy, Slim Shady, up in your motherfucking radio baby

[Bridge: Eminem]
No matter what people say, I'm gon' keep rapping this way
No matter what you may think, I'mma keep doing my thing
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm the worst thing since fat bald men
Decided to write songs to teach Mouseketeers to sing
I stick Britney Spears in a room full of mirrors
So she gets fifty years of bad luck
Causing terror to Christina Aguilera
When I grab her by the hair and drag her across the Sahara
Beware of this rap terrorist with a therapist
With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants
Got a habit of holding Tylenol in his hands
Till it melts in his fucking palms and dissolves in his glands
(So who is it?) The fool who visit the playground
With two biscuits to lay down the school district
Get pistol-whipped with a Mossberg
With a pistol grip, and fed pitbull shits
Sniff glue sticks like I give two shits
If I get too rich, I just get sued
[Verse 2: Redman]
Yo, 
I leave wit no injure, after I blow four in ya
One handstand on top of yo ninja
Crash it,
 
Doc stir the madness
Till y'all outta work like Tony Atlas
Walking, cans in the laundry basket
America's most
, 
with the army after us
Fuck flossing, we take what's yours
Unload fifteen like a ace and four
I'm outta work, but Doc laid them off
(Shit, the power's out) The tape is off!
Yo, you targeted from arsonists
Papermate pens filled wit arsenic
I got hoes that don't know what Prada is
Doc could shape up, 
touch your barber miss
Fade
 
you with a bloody blade
I turn rap camps into Crystal Lake
Fuck bitches face is what I'mma do
Cause that's what white boy Tano do
[Hook - Eminem & Redman]
So how is everybody doing tonight?
Hope you're in the mood to get drunk and scream in a fight
Cause uh, we getting down for the fuck of it
So suck my dick if y'all don't wanna bump to this... Off the Wall!!
[Bridge]
[Verse 3: Redman]
Yo, you could buy Jaz spitting, hospital, son admit it
Rip your lips off, kiss my ass with it
Slap bitches, 
got Marshall Math's (printing)
Weed, X, and the acid tabs did it
I'm "What's Happening," with no re-run
Like Rob DeNiro when the Heat come
My 
barrel
 hang out the 
Camaro
Aimed at the nose of them hoes
, 
it's hard to breathe from
Flash the gat, your town, bogarting
Your wallet, your chain the main target
Beef is like cold engine: don't start it
Bust in the air and hit a airplane pilot
We clowned you,
 
rap surround sounds around you
From ten speed and brown shoe
Doc
 and Eminem, 
cock the M&M
Blood flows with 2Pacalypse and them
[Verse 4: Eminem]
It's like, 
Funk Doctor
 meets 
the punk rocker
Got the drugs stocked inside the lunch box
 (uhh)
Pop junk like I just got jumped
Popped the 
trunk
 and pulled out 
the shotgun pump
Knock wood, it's all good; thank God for vodka
Cause wit my luck, I'll probably get shot by a stalker
Probably got a fanatic waiting upstairs in the attic
With a automatic calling me up there
My man, Stan, with a gat in his hand
Staking my house out in a tan, tinted sedan
Pull your mouth out till you can't finish a damn
Ham sandwich, or your can spinach and Spam
Till you gotta sip through a straw
, shoplift through the mall
Pictures of me on my mom's living room wall
Hey Ma... maybe I'll give you a call
Psyche! You fucking bitch, suck a dick and two balls!
I'm giving you all my job descrip'
, which is
To piss bitches and priests off with this (...need Jesus!)
Pop more pills till police officers
Arrive at the scene and pull me off of Kim
Teeth off my dick, hands off my balls
But y'all can kiss my ass, pants off and all!
Cause I'm so goddamn off the wall
I might as well just be a painting smashed on the floor
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Outro: Slim Shady]
No matter what people say
I'm gon' keep doing my thing
No matter... oh

[Sampled from Eminem's "Criminal"]
{*Eminem whistling*}
[Teller:] Hi
[Eminem:] How you doin'?
[Teller:] How can I help you?
[Eminem:] Yeah, I need to make a withdrawal...
{*Gun cocks*} Put the fucking money in the bag, bitch, and I won't kill you
[Teller:] What? Oh my God, don't kill me
[Eminem:] I'm not gonna kill you, bitch. Quit fucking around
[Teller:] Don't kill me, I have two kids at home!
[Eminem:] I said I'm not gonna fucking kill you!
[Teller:] Don't kill me!
[Eminem:] 
Hurry the fuck up! {*Gunshot*} Thank you!
[Verse 1: Hush]
I gotta keep this engine running (I'll be back)
Pedal to the metal, Swifty better hurry up
Cause I ain't going back to jail
I don't wanna see my face up in Newsweek
I'm sitting like a duck, like Tulley up in "Blue Streak"
What the fuck is taking so long?
(Hurry up, motherfucker, I'mma hit this gas and be GONE!)
But I can't leave my homey (Hold up!) They all know me
I'm the Jeff Gord-on of this bitch, the cops can blow me
Fuck, who is that? Shit, I'm getting nervous
Staring out this dirty windshield for any persons
Damn, it's this bum, cleaning with a squeegee
(Here's a dollar, motherfucker, now scram before they see me!)
I hope they didn't ring the alarm (Shit)
Swifty's gonna have to bomb, and then it fucks up the job
But I don't care, as long as we flee this place
Cause the last thing I need is a fucking police chase, shit
Cool, here he comes, I hope he's got the stash
(Yo nigga, pull off! We heading to the bank for some mo' cash!)
Yo, there better be enough for me to get that maid back
(Hey yo, don't worry 'bout that, dog, the cash is in our laps)
[Hook: Eminem]
Put the money in the back, bitch, this is a stickup
Anybody who moves is getting picked up, off the ground
This is the sound, this is how its going down
If I'm going down, then you're going down (Down)
Now this is the plot: we pull this off, then we split the pot
We get caught, I'm peeling off, the deal is off
But if we can pull this caper, then we can get this paper
Then I'm going, off to Tijuana
Come on, I'm ready if you are
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
(?) while I sit in the car chiefing
In the mood to be thieving this season
Hey yo, Hush, I'mma snatch what they (?)
Pull over and I'mma rob this bitch for a purpose
You can either read it or see it
(What you mean, "Read it or see it?")
It'll work, know what's worse?
It's better than having to beat a bitch up out of her purse
I been pacing this bank, patiently waiting
For the day they get up in this motherfucker
So don't drive away (I'll be right here!)
Hey ('sup?) Nigga, pop the trunk so I can grab the AK
And then I'm headed to the safe
I'm at the counter in the teller's face
"Yo, if anybody move, I'mma make spaghetti out of your wife!" (Don't shoot!)
I hopped a gate, shot a citizen
After he gave me the combination to open it
And there was nothing but Benjamins
Filled it back and jetted up, headed to the door
Hush is in the front, revving up (Motherfucker, come on!)
I jumped over the security, while he on the floor
Trying to pull my feet, I shot him before he could draw
Hit the street and we swerve
No less than a hundred thousand in our back seat
(Now I'm peeling off the curb)
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kuniva]
I got some chips up my sleeve
I walked in a 7-11 and grabbed Aviv
And put the heat to his cheek
Don't even think about moving
Just gimme the loot and I'll be cruising
Along with my day and it won't be a shooting
(Mister, please don't hurt me! Here, have a Slurpee!)
Oh my God, Aviv, shut the fuck up, your voice irks me
All of this for three hundred seventy six dollars and eight cents?
This robbery does not make sense
Come on out bitch (scream) Yeah, you, behind the chip rack
Your little stank ass is on the verge of getting pimp slapped
Gimme your paper, your jewels, and all of your valuables
Serious about that scrilla, Kuniva an animal
Rushing out the front door, zigzagging and dodging traffic
If it gets drastic, my automatic will start a blasting
That's how we do it where I'm from, me, Swift, and Hush
We ducking off, contemplating which lick to rush
[Hook]

Oh no what's happening to my brain
I can't believe this is happening again
[Verse 1]
Lava on my lips I flips,
 wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
I think I'm out of gas, man, 
I think I need another mask
I'd ask my mother but I think 
she's laughing at the plants
A half a gram of graham crackers
 and some 
Van de Kamp's
I think I'll eat some Ambiens like they're candied yams
Cut a couple cadavers up and have a little snack
Abra-fucking-cadabra,
 
motherfucker look who's back
Just like a pendulum, Satan's pentagram swings
I accidentally dented it and bent the damn thing
Shit I think I might have did it when I was dancing
While I was chopping one of my legs off and pulled a hamstring
First I Re-Up, then I Relapse
Go to rehab and I Detox after I see Doc
And I'll be back with the sequel
, 
repeat the cycle
Cause I react like the "She-Hulk" when I see Nyquil
[Hook]
Oh no
Here we go again
Don't know
When it's going to end
Oh oh
Where did it begin
Don't know
Maybe way back when
(Relapse!)
[Verse 2]
Into the well, baby Jessica fell,
 
she may have wetted herself
Quit playing, get her some help
Mary Kay Letourneau sending me letters from jail, every day in journals
Saying how,
 she wanted to smother me in lettuce and mayo
I'm the medicine man, 
my medical marijuana
Was prescribed by a doctor,
 
shove a typewriter up
Perez Hilton's ass,
 shit, almost forgot that
He's always shoving something up his ass so why not that?
And fuck it while I'm venting let's shove a vending machine
Up his rear end
 when he's bending over pretending that he
Didn't say anything that would be offending to me
Stick his head in a blender, begin blending and gee
Where should I put the pink sissy with the fluffy hair?
Put him under the stairs? People are already under there
Hmm, I wonder where. Wait, I think the cubpoard's bare
Stuff him up in the tupperware and shove him up in there
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Vicodin's like a nitrogen hydrogen vitamin
I bite into five and then I get high as a kite again
I like it when I get in my zone on the mic again
Who am I kidding? I couldn't quit this shit if my life depends
I relapsed twice after 
I came outta Brighton then
Yeah, rehab's nice, I had my name up in lights again
You see that's why I can't decipher what life I'm in
I might pull a knife on your wife and slice her and dice her then
It sounds so enticing, isn't it nice when I'm hype again?
I'm nice when I'm like this, no time to write just type it in
If I could get my pen to slow down, what'd I write just then?
Man I'm 'bout to hyperventilate,
 
I just have hyper-tension
I have the type of mental state you couldn't comprehend
Unusually stupid of you to think I'm your friend
I usually do what I do and suffer no consequence
I offer no mercy, the controversy is once again
[Hook]

[Intro:]
Dirty Harry is dead [x4]
I'm here to announce that Dirty Harry is dead
Now we witness the rise of 
the son, Oil Can Harry
, the Boss, hahaha
[Verse 1]
My life is trapped in these lines, that's why I'm packin' these nines
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back on my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers til I'm snappin' my spine
Naturally, I gotta focus
On these bogus poachers, lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda!
Hold up (Eminem: We nothin' but soldiers)
Slow up (Eminem: This gun is loaded)
Roll up 
(Eminem: They beef and we leavin' 'em coked up)
If Slim say it I spray it, if he will it I kill it
We Kilpatrick and Ilitch of Detroit, y'all can feel it
Got this gun on my wasteline in war we dont waste time
Ja, man he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got School Craft here at the 7, 8, and text her
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha ya flinch
When Proof shoot up they coup, and waste your whole clique
Fuck it who's next on this shit, this is prefrence to bitch
When you preface to stiffen slugs has atcha wit
You'll be next to BIG, Pac is destiny kid
Before ya lick, ya pop, stop testin' me bitch
[Hook]
Homie you think you tough (what)
Think we won't fuck you up (punk)
Even the innocent get pistol-whipped by this pistol grip (punk)
Talkin' shit you drunk (what)
Think I won't fuck you up (punk)
We both deep, I ain't scared and I don't give a fuck (jump)
[Verse 2]
I ain't feel no games, homie don't even try
We ain't bowin' down to no one we gon' start a riot (yeah)
Heart of fire, soul of ice,
 
roll the dice, see what you get
No advice, all my life I ain't live in this bitch
I'm a man, more I'm holdin' my ground
To loadin' these rounds, at any call approachin' my crown (blah)
I'm a king o' grimey, nothin' but killas
In behind me, I'm a bully fully cuz your team is tiny
If I was to crush 'em, got to say these Bibles are nothin'
This rifle on clutches to leave you stifled on crutches
I fight for my cousins that ain't even related
Even I stated, not from life I leave you bleedin' and faded
Hatin' made in my nature, I'm clappin' and clackin' your captain
Smackin' faggots and act as a rapper with platinum status, ya livin'
 flappin' 'em slappin' 'em backwards
After these rappers' status
To shadders, knowin' Proof 
and that Mathers has gathered an army
It's Shady bandatas
After rest the game is won, who in the matters get blamed fast with brain damage
The name that some forgot, D12, it ain't hard to feel, guard ya grill, it's REAL!
[Hook]

[Produced by Dr. Dre and Mark Batson]
[Intro - Eminem]
Good evening, this is your fucking captain speaking
We will soon be reaching an altitude of 4 million and a half feet
That's 8 million miles in the sky
Please, undo your seat belt for takeoff
You are now free to smoke about the cabin
[Verse 1a - Dr. Dre]
I'm Dre from back in the day
From N.W.A.
, 
from black and the gray
From choking a bitch to smacking her face
From stacking up bodies to racking AKs up
From racking up hits to stacking them crates up
I'm still hungry and I'm back with a tapeworm
And we're what's happening in rap entertainment
Me and Shady, far as competition? Faggot, there ain't none
[Verse 1b - Eminem]
Speak of the devil
, 
it's attack of the Rain Man
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron
Soon as the blade spun
 - 
vrunn!
 - 
they run away from
Who wanna play dungeon?
 
No one is safe from
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one
Wait, it ain't funny, man, it's urgent, I need one
2 boxes of detergent and a paint gun
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1
, so
[Hook - Eminem]
One more time for old time's sake
Dre drop that beat, and scratch that break
Now just blow a little bit of that smoke my way
And let's go (
you are now smoking with the best
)
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless
A nice environment, surprised entirely
Hypotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants
Taking lives of firemen
Say goodbye, here I am again
, 
naked wives and Vicodin
Before I begin to get so high, pussy; boy, I could spin
"Vinn-vinn!"
; 
Fuck the handle, I fly off the hinge
Let that boy off the bench, coach, and throw it to him
There he goes in his trenchcoat, no clothes again
Baby, make us some french toast and show us some skin
I'll show you every inch grows on my foreskin
Show me nipple, I'mma pinch both and throw up a ten
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again
The sorcerer of intercourse; if it's forced, it's him
Don't fight the feelin' if you're feelin' the force within
Then when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain
, so
[Hook]
[Verse 3a - Dr. Dre]
Now where there's smoke there's fire
Where there's fire there's flames
Where there's flames there's chronic
Either you high or you ain't
I got no time for no games
[Verse 3b - Eminem]
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin'
He's gonna get the AK and aim it right at your brain
I'm slightly insane, vodka and creatine
Hypnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink
And it's giving me wings, I believe I can fly
While I pee on the girl
, 
you won't catch me, C.S.I
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake
Dre, get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake
[Verse 3c - Dr. Dre]
Now put your smoke up in the air
, 
raise your
 
Henny and Coke
And if you really wanna get fucked up, just let me know
We can smoke 'til there's no more lighter fluid to do it
Let's get into it, you're smoking with the triedest and truest
I got the Midas touch when it comes to rolling shit up
You motherfuckers ain't smoking, you just holding shit up
Now here we go let's get up, get down, hold up a blunt
I smoke the kinda stuff that make the records go number one
Cause if at first you don't succeed, won't hurt to smoke some weed
Now them words are just a little more personal for me
Seein' as how, I blew up off of puffing them trees
[Verse 3d - Eminem]
Well, smoke enough for me! Fuck yeah, light it up 
Cheech
C'mon, smoke me out, cuz! 
Give me contact buzz
Get me on track, 
they love me when I'm on that stuff
"But this is Earth calling, Shady man, come on back!" What?
"Man we're losin' him, he won't even respond back, fuck!"
Now look at all the pretty women in here (Damn bitches)
Dre, it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages
Now baby just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit just

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Sometimes it's hard, to wake up in the morning
Mind full of demons I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
Cause they seein' destruction before they see a human bein'
So they start smokin', we will never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cuz they all broken, why do ghetto birds die
Before we learn to fly, somebody else should try
Cockin' guns, smokin', we can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen a change unfold
I'll keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need, of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open, I can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
Away the tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers speak wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies
[Verse 2: Eminem]
We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate
Control our mental states, settle down and set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate
Cause by then it's just too late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate
To the point that he just breaks, snaps, and it's all it takes
You think that we was learnin' from other rappers' mistakes
But we ain't, its grain to go against
With every artist comes the image he portrays and the picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger and this angst
Never once did you heard me say
I'm a gangster and I ain't hear no complaints
But I know, that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead, and never follow in no one else's shadow
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day, the game, will never be the same
No matter how much fame and success they attain
There will never be another me
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds
We will never die, we are forever alive
[2Pac]
And we continue growin', one day at a time
[Verse 3: Outlawz]
Don't get caught in the publicity and caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money and lights
Searchin' for fortune and fame and superstardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew's the hardest
There's not a hip-hop police, the villains is watchin'
And the kids think beef, is they only option
Outlawz born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories took a dive, my Machiavelli lives on
You think the industry is fun, and no pity with guns
And when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died, and came back, would he try to save rap
We needin' a change, the drama remains the same
I spend my whole life, fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
And hey now then, I take rights and no lefts
I'm still, just like a kid, lookin for stripes on my belt
Yeah, that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray and hope God, take a light to myself
No matter how much I try, stay alive, I'ma die a man
Still standin' and in love with my pride
Heard frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income comin' in and collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
And I finally realize that we're not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it
Them .45's will pop killas, yes I'm still with it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle and hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
[2Pac]
And we continue growin', one day at a time, damn

[Intro: Fatt Father]
I told y'all motherfuckers I was coming back (oh shit)
What now nigga, what now? What?
 
Brewster Projects nigga
[Hook: Eminem]
One shot, two shot, three shots, four shots
All I hear is gunshots, this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop, hit the floor
, 
music's off, party stops
Everybody hit the door, somebody's licking shots off
[Bizarre]
Security's gone, I'm trapped in the club
And I'm trying to run and get my motherfucking gun
(Nigga what about yo' wife?
) 
Nigga fuck my wife
I'm trying to run and save my motherfucking life
Oh, shit! The shooter's coming
Bitches hollering, niggas running
People, shot all over the floor
And I'm trying to make it to the St. Andrew's door
(
Hey man) {*chk-chk-BOOM*} That's the sound of the Glock
Even DJ Houseshoes fucked around and got shot
I done messed around, and forget my 
tec
I don't see nobody, 
but Fat Father and Hex
[Kuniva]
(
Kuniva, you hurt?
) 
These niggas is tripping
(
Where's Bizarre at?
) (I don't know, man)
I'm trying to slip through the exit and get to where my car is at
Bitches screaming everywhere and niggas is wilding
Two minutes ago we was all joking and smiling
This chick is clinging on to me, sobbing and sighing
Saying she didn't mean to diss me earlier and she crying
But it's real and it's on and 
caps is getting peeled
So I hugged her and 
used her body as a human shield
 and
She got hit and now she's yelling (DON'T LEAVE ME!)
I told her I'd be right back and the dumb bitch believed me!
I squeezed through the back door and made my escape
I ran and got my .38 I hope it's not too late!
[Hook]
[Swift (Kon Artis)]
(I been trying to call you all day motherfucker where you at?)
I'm on 7 Mile {*gunfire*} what the fuck was that?
{*gunfire*} 
Damn, somebody hit me from the back!
(What with they car?)With a gat nigga, and my tire flat
{*crash*} And I just hit a pole, them niggas some hoes
(Is you hit?) I don't know, but I can tell you what they drove
It was a black Mitsubishi
 (
Shit, that's the clique we beefing with
)
Maaaaan! (I swear)
 And I was on my way there
Believe me, I'm leaving a carcass today
And I'mma park my car and walk the rest of the way
I'm in the mood to strut, my 
AK
 ain't even 
tucked
I'mma meet you at the club, we gon' fuck these hoes up!
[Hook]
[Eminem]
I never seen no shit like this in my life before
People are still camped out from the night before
Sleeping outside the door, waiting in line still
Trying to get inside the club to see
 
D12 perform
The fire marshals know, the venue's too small
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd
Fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot
Gets in an argument over a parking spot
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off
Missed who he's aiming for, six feet away is the door
Into 
St. Andrew's
 Hall, now the 
strays
 flying all over the place
Grazed one bitch in the face
Another one of 'em came through the wall
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off
I'm posted up at the bar, having a mazeltov
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off
Thank God I'm alive
, I gotta find 
Denaun
And where the fuck is Von? He usually tucks one on him
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre
Nah I guess not, what the fuck? Oh my God, it was!
I never saw him run so fast in my life
Look at him hauling ass
, 
I think he left his wife
There she is, on the ground, being trampled
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her
{*blam*} God damn, there just went another damn bullet
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it
I scoop Dee
, 
follow Bizarre's path, ran through it
 and
Made it to the front door and collapsed
On the steps looked up and I seen 
Swift
Shooting it out but I can't see who he's shooting it out with
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezing his
 
four-fifth
[Hook]
[Kon Artis]
Yo, it's Friday night, came to this bitch right
Big ass on my left, hand Desert Eagle in my right
I ain't come in this bitch to party, I came in this bitch to fight
Although I can't stay here to fight cause I'm popping niggas tonight
That's right bitches I'm drunk with revenge
Shot a bouncer in the neck for trying to check when I get in
Swift told me to meet him here, so it's clear that the schmuck
That shot out the back of his truck is up in this motherfucker
So one shot for the money, two is to stop the show
The third's for the bartender (bitch bring me a bottle of
 
Mo')
I just wanna know who driving the black Mitsubishi?
He tried to run, so
 
Proof shot him in the knee with a three-piece
[Hook]

[Jake Steidle]
I don’t give a fuck, so tell me why I should start now
I’m 8 foot, so I’m still 6 when I sit down
You’re small now? What goes around comes around. So I’ll attack you till you’re put back in the ground
You heard of me? So what, you don’t like my new sound?
Straight impound, in your ears until I get found
The shots ring out all around the down town. Till the police show up, and see the bodies, unbound
I’m ghost man, running through the streets that surround
Until I’m hiding out, looking for the pigs, you know now
I’m real, and that’s about enough to be said. Just know that, I’m not afraid to put a bullet in your head
I’ll climb in the window then hide under your bed, and wait for the reaper so I know that you’re dead
I only truly care that my family gets fed, so if I have to I change your clothes from blue to blood red
[Eminem]
One shot two shot three shots four shots
All I hear is gunshots this is where the fun stops
Bodies drop hit the floor music's off
Parties stop, everybody hit the door someone's licking shots off

[Intro]
You know, critics, man
Critics never got nothing nice to say, man
You know the one thing I notice about critics, man, is
Critics never ask me how my day went
Well Imma tell 'em ...
[Verse 1]
Yesterday my dog died
, I hog tied a ho,
 
tied her in a bow
So the next time you blog try to spit a flow
You want to criticize, dog? Try a little more
I'm so tired of this
 
I could blow fire in the hole
I'm fired up so fire up the lighter and the dro
Better hold on a little tighter here I go
Flows tighter, 
hot headed as Ghost Rider
Cold hearted as Spiderman throwing a spider in the snow
So you better get lower than Flo-rida
Inside of a lowrider with no tires in the hole
Why am I like this? Why is winter cold?
Why is it when I talk I'm so biased to the hoes
Listen dog, Christmas is off, this is as soft as it gets
This isn't golf this is a blistering assault
Those are your wounds this is the salt
, so get lost
Shit dissing me is just like pissing off the Wizard of Oz
Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws and cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with
 
Jaws
So sip piss like sizzurp through a straw
Then describe how it tasted like dessert to us all
Got the gall to make Chris piss in his drawers
Tickle him, go to his grave, skip him and visit his dog
[Hook]
You're on fire
Thats how you know you're on a roll
Cause when you hot its like your burning up everyone else's cold
You're on fire
Man I'm so fucking sick I got ambulances pulling me over and shit
You're on fire
You need to stop drop and roll
Cause when you say the shit to get the whole Hip Hop Shop to blow
You're on fire, you're on fire
[Verse 2]
I just put a bullshit hook in between two long ass verses
If you mistook this for a song, look
This ain't a song
 
its a warning to Brooke Hogan and David Cook
That the crook just took over so book
Run as fast as you can, stop writing and kill it
I'm lightning in a skillet you're a fucking flash in a pan
I pop up you bitches scatter like hot grease splashing a fan
Mr. Mathers is the man
Yeah I'm pissed but I would rather take this energy and stash it in a can
Come back and whip your ass with it again
Saliva's like sulfuric acid in your hand
It'll eat through anything metal, the ass of Iron Man
Turn him into plastic
So for you to think that you could stand a fucking chance is asinine
Yeah, ask Denaun man
Hit a blind man with a coloring book and told him color inside the lines
Or get hit with a flyin crayon, fuck it I ain't playing
Pull up in a van and hop out at a homeless man
Holding a sign saying: Vietnam vet, I'm out my fucking mind man
Kick over the can, beat his ass, and leave him 9 grand
So if I seem a little mean to you
This ain't savage you ain't never seen a brute
You want to get graphic we can go the scenic route
You couldn't make a bulimic puke
On a piece of fucking corn and peanut poop
Saying you sick, quit playing you prick don't nobody care
And why the fuck am I yelling at air
I ain't even talking to no one cause ain't nobody there
Nobody will fucking test me cause these hoes won't even dare
I'm wasting punchlines but I got so many to spare
I just thought of another one that might go here
Naw don't waste it save it psycho yeah
Plus you got to rewrite those lines that you said about Michael's hair

You are now rocking with the best

[Hook]
We on fire
Up in here, it's burning hot
We on fire
Shorty take it off if it get to hot, up in this spot
We on fire
Tear the roof off this motherfucker, light the roof on fire
Nigga what you say
We get loose in this motherfucker, light the roof on fire fire fire
[Verse 1]
Now I ain't putting nothing out, I smoke when I wanna
26-inch chrome spokes on the Hummer
This heat gon last for the whole summer
Running your bitch faster then the Road Runner
Rocks on my wrist, rolls gold under
Glocks on my hip, those throw thunder
Im buying diamond by the pier
But when you stop, the only thing still spinning is your ear
Yeah, im riding with that all black snub
Raiders cap back, all black gloves
Im 80s man, but the boy smack thugs
These record sales equal more back rubs
Not to mention I bought a pack of clubs
His impacts about as raw as crack was
Now all these new artists getting raw deals
Im only 21, sitting on mills
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
If you know anything about me, then you know im a baller
If I ain't hit the first night, I ain't gon call her
Im trying to play, you trying to have my daughter
But I can't blame her for what her momma taught her
And I don't care bout what the next nigga bought her
Cause I ain't putting no baguettes in her butter
I got a diamond about as clear as water
And I got bread, but I ain't spend quarters
So cut the games ma, lets go in the back
Matter fact, turn your ass round, back a nigga down
And I ain't bias when im riding through the town
Like em small, like em tall, like em black, like em brown
She gotta be able to come when I need her
Tight ass pants, little wife beater
Regular chick or R&B diva
Bitch say something, I ain't a mind reader
[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'mma do something I do it,
 
I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shitting
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game
, 
like a "fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse
, 
forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together
, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
[Verse 2]
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words
In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back,
 
click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now
[Hook]
[Bridge]
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my
 
demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I have been through the wringer, 
 
but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye,
 
I feel like the king of
My world,
 
haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar
, 
I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing
 
and...

[Intro]
Hey yo, what's up man? Hey, yo you been here all day man
Ya'll been here every weekend man
I don't ever get a chance to rap first man!
That's cause you wack!
What?!? I ain't wack nigga, I got some raps for all ya'll
Nigga my raps fresh, I'mma bust my raps first
You can bust yours after me if you want to
No no man, I'm going first
I'm getting tired of everybody wanted to go first man
You always rap first
I'm rapping I don't care what none of ya'll say
I'm fresh, I'm fresh
[Hook: Thyme]
Ayo, who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out man I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
I said who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out bitch I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'll have you taken back to Christ when you sacrifice
The way you're hacked and sliced when I tear your back with knifes
Jacking life's of MC's
, 
now I'm set to launch a plan
For blowing up the stage with illegal contraband
A stomped your man so unless you want what he got
You better set the mic down, I'm steaming like a teapot
I'll make the tea hot
, 
people get in my face and ask
If I wanna battle, then I chase them in a Jason mask
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, now I give a fuck less
And in a slug fest I get physical like physicians
Invisible like magicians with mystical mic traditions
Wicked wizardry, like a sorcerer and no remorse for you
When I torture you throughout the course of my orchestra
So feel the force of my spiritual images
Slicing up an enemy's appendages till he hemorrhages
My skin itches every time a rapper recites
And when he's through with his verse, I'm all covered in flea bites
You wanna see fights I got a match for you
You couldn't flip shit playing in toilets with a spatula
[Hook: Thyme]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
You bitches get a hysterectomy disrespecting me
You wanna feel the full effect of me, hand a tech to me
Intellectually superior, I'll make the whack wearier
Inferior, deteriorate, like bacteria
Materially, killing serially, clearly you'll see
How much in fear when you hear me you'll be
Shiver and shake, quiver and quake
Bite a rhyme and rip it off then stiffer and ache, whither and break
You slithering snake, gibbering fake, fibbering flake
I'll twist you into a different shape
And toss you in Michigan Lake, for fisherman sake
If this is a dream you'd wish you can wake
Every dis you can take, personal
We ain't friends trying to make amends
If you ain't ever stole a gate you can take a fence
I make intense masterpieces and smash to pieces
Your last releases, you bad diseases, that's the reason
I'm showing you the proper way to operate a mic
So pass it like a hot potato
I've never been less than clever and fresh
Severing flesh of fools who never impressed I can confess
[Hook: Thyme]
[Outro: Thyme]
Whhhooo the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Point him out!! I wanna know
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
(scratched in) I wanna know, I wanna know
Ayo let me get that mic man
Who the fuck passed you the mic and said that you can flow?
Who the fuck passed you the mic, who the fuck passed you the mic!!
I got the rhymes bitch, I'll kick that shit

[Kuniva]
Check my vocals, cause you know what I'm about
It's best to play like 
O.J. Simpson and I just stab out
Why did you enter? You didn't comprehend
See this is a battle for MCs who think they might win
But fuck the battle, let's take it to the streets
Cause you a pussy, oh well, if you are what you eat
Now you can go get your crew ? you now
? me wrong ? and all this shit gon be blew out
Claiming you jumped ?
Nigga you come in this bitch, you talk more shit than Reggie Miller
Never spent nothing more, nothing less
The first single that you drop is "I wanna be fresh"
[Eminem]
Any rapper sayin' those kind of rhymes
In this day and age, in this period of time
Trying to battle Eminem is worse than 
David Starr
Trying to battle 
Proof
, 
Eye-Kyu
, B-Flat, 
Bizarre
? that's why you beg to differ me
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to brag, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip up in the zone
If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
So get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And take this building down cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop

Here's the story, of a little boy
Growin' up in a suburban home
Trying to cope with everyday life
Who lives in a little house
That was built, in the middle of the street
[Verse 1]
"Hey, Mom! 2Pac's on the juke box
So what he shot two cops
And raped a little girl while two dudes watched"
"Nuh-uh! They were tryin' to frame him
You and that Two Pack Shaker,"
"No! That ain't how you say his name, mum!
You're so lame, don't you know anything?"
"Yeah! I know that you'll probably go and join in a gang,"
"Yeah, right. I'm out. Where's my fuckin' walkman at?"
"Stop cussin' at me!"
"Shut up, bitch!"
"And quit talking black!"
Well, slammed the door and I'm out
Now, what? It's probably warm in the house
Fuck, I forgot my jacket, forgot it was winter
I'm gettin' thinner, I'm hungry
Is Mom cookin' dinner?
"Mom! Let me back in! I forgot my coat
Mom, come on, I'm not playin', it's cold!
Alright, sorry, I need a jacket
Mom, look, my 2Pac tape, I just cracked it
Ma, please let me back in
It is Two Pack Shaker, I just asked him"
I'm freezin', I'm sneezin'
I'm breathin' too much cold air, I'm wheezin'
"I ain't did nothin' I didn't say "I'm leavin'"
I said "I'm goin' on the front porch to get somethin'"
(scissors cutting) "Alright, here take your damn coat and leave,"
"Finally! Mom! You cut off the sleeves!"
[Hook]
Our house
In the middle of the street
One, two, three
My teacher's two faced, went to lower all my school grades
Since Last Tuesday I had a toothache from kool-aid
So Mom kicked me out, and all I had in my suitcase
Was one shoelace, a tube sock, and a tube of toothpaste
Sometimes it was cool cause I could go to a friend's
Crash there, fool around and just skip school
But other times I'd rather just be home
In my own room alone 
beat my shit and nobody would know
My little brother sucked on a bottle til he was six
So I'd hide it inside the couch and say
"I don't know where it is"
But as soon as Mom found it I would either be grounded
Or kicked out of the house a thousand weeks, and still countin'
Even when I was underage
Mom was tellin' cops I was tryin' to run away
I told her "Someday, bitch, you're gonna pay"
Please, Mom, Please, Mom, Please
I wanna stay, (let me stay)
[Hook]
My brother's incoherent
, 
Mom's a single parent
Who ain't carin', starin' through me
Like I'm 
transparent, made it clear
That I was just there to run an errand
Told her friends I was a son from her last marriage
Sent me up to the corner store with a little note
"Please, sell my 
step-son
some cigarettes so I can smoke"
One time I tried to fake sick to get attention
Back-fired
, 
Mom sent me to school with a vengence
My life's the worst thing that could ever happen to me
I go to class and every teacher's always laughin' at me
And Mom says white rappers are laughed at
Not only that, she heard me upstairs
I can't rap, and 
I'm stupid
I never make an average of a B+
I need to sit on my ass and sue people like she does
One time, I got food poison from a hot dog
Mom sued and got $2,000 from 
Ballpark
"Hey, Ma. You got a dollar?"
"I don't think so
, now keep an eye on your brother
I'm goin' to bingo."
"But, Mom. You said you were broke."
"Who said? You got your ears messed up
From that damn rap music."
[Hook]

[Hook 1: Eminem]
I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God, if you're listenin'
Please grant me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreaming, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm coming off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want
[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G Rap
, 
Ras Kass
, 
Kurupt
Redman
 
I am cut from that cloth
Write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, I'm Bad video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
While they smoked and drank
Symphony,
 
D.O.C. inspired me to write what
Would eventually put me on airplanes like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu-Tang, you know our history, but hats off
When we rap this Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank God for the one-two cadence
Thank God for the lunchroom tables
I'm trying to be the sickest nigga, dead or alive
And if I happen to fall short, it's been one hell of a ride
Chronic 1 and 2, looking up at the sky at the sun
Up until the day the sun is you
You listening to hip-hop, you in Jay's house
Wayne's house, Nas' house
Em's house, Our House
[Hook 2: Skylar Grey]
So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here
[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack
But in the words of a ten year old, my shit was getting phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowing how the booth would feel, what's ADAT's and two inch reel
How you ad-lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike you made a monster
Now everyday's a game of Contra, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm telling you
Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggas sounding, damn
Weak head, ya'll suck bad,
 
fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna to be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life,
 
so wipe your feet before you step in
Our house
[Hook 2 & Hook 1]
[Interlude: Joe Budden]
I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be
[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passed us by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts,
 competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours
, 
so send cowards
The message from
 
Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa
[Verse 4: Eminem]
In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight
, 
only way to be great, is to dig down
, 
if you can hear this sound in-
-side my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsights, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad, felt like-I-could-go-mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bothered me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back into working a regular job?
Fuck that,
 
I'mma go hard, grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck theyselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world
 
it's like Clash Of The Titans
I released the cracker
 
it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron
So come on in, at your own risk
This is (Our House) Bitch!
[Hook 2]

[Hook 1: Eminem]
I wanna be the best who ever did it
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't
But if it is then God, if you're listenin'
Please grant me the strength to crush all competition
You can't blame me for dreaming, I'm a dreamer
And if I'm coming off brash please forgive me
But, that's all I want
[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be
Mayhem, sickness, murder, horror
These are the kind of words that describe my aura
G Rap, Ras Kass, Kurupt
Redman I am cut from that cloth
Write a rhyme about me, you a dead man
Cool J, I'm Bad video
Learned the whole routine and performed it for my father's friends
While they smoked and drank
Symphony, D.O.C. inspired me to write what
Would eventually put me on airplanes like B.o.B
Canibus, Wu-Tang, you know our history but hats off
When we rap this Jack Frost we outline the track chalk
Thank God for the one-two cadence
Thank God for the lunchroom tables
I'm trying to be the sickest nigga, dead or alive
And if I happen to fall short, it's been one hell of a ride
Chronic 1 and 2, looking up at the sky at the sun
Up until the day the sun is you
You listening to hip-hop, you in Jay's house
Wayne's house, Nas' house
Em's house, Our House
[Hook 2: Skylar Grey]
So welcome, to our house
Where no one, comes back out
You won't find, comfort
In here, in here, in here
[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
When I was a little boy I wanted to be a rapper
Wanted to be on the radio and snapping pictures after
And so I grabbed my pen and pad and scribbled chitter chatter
It started off wack
But in the words of a ten year old, my shit was getting phatter
I hit the studio at 16, stupid ill
Not knowing how the booth would feel, what's ADAT's and two inch reel
How you ad-lib? What's a punch? I ain't a boxer
But I sure enough learned the ropes, look D and Mike you made a monster
Now everyday's a game of Contra, I got 99 men
An infinite amount of rounds inside this mighty fine pen
This is my dream, don't fuck with it, I'm telling you
Cause anyone can get dusted as long as production is available
I'm disgusted as a fan, look how niggas sounding, damn
Weak head, ya'll suck bad, fuck swag and your kicks from South Japan
I'm finna to be the best in this profession
I've been invested all my life, so wipe your feet before you step in
Our house
[Hook 2 & Hook 1]
[Interlude: Joe Budden]
I just wanna be the illest MC (That's all I want)
The same time being as real as can be
[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
I never wanted a chain that was encrusted
I wanted to be respected amongst my peers and to be trusted
Wanted not to be complacent though okay with my regression
I was banking hip hop would do away with my depression
I wanted to be understood but they never got my deposition
I never wanted attention, but I lusted recognition
Wanted peace with my child's mom wanted to be a better dad
Not as a person wanted to give that nigga choices I never had
Which honestly kept me alive cause in order for me to give
I needed not to be suicidal though it was killing me just to live
Wanted to make mother cry and choke her up cause she proud
Wanted to marry my dreams so I cheated on fear broke up with my doubts
So I got no choice but to succeed and show music that I'm capable
She the one I'm grateful to and Id hate for her to think that I'm unfaithful too
If she did her soul would bleed, but they raised another breed in (Our House)
[Hook 2]
[Verse 4: Crooked I]
Yo, in my house, the lights out
No utilities in the facilities
Feeling my life's 'bout, to wipe out
These feelings I'm feeling be killing me
I pull the mic out, can't strike out
Cause if winning is really my enemy
I pull a nine out, blow my mind out
Is the end of me really serenity?
Man in my house, it's rap or die
Get a piece of that apple pie
Life is a Pharcyde song, and that bitch just passes by
So I, got lyrically complex, that way I could clock checks
Get my moms out the projects, with these concepts, competition can't digest
And then I stress cause the road is rough
I start feeling like shit's sour
The electricity in my will power could still power the twin towers
For ten hours, so send cowards
The message from Crooked I
Royce Da 5, Joe Budden, Em, Yaowa
[Verse 5: Eminem]
In our, house we spit like Sig Sauers
The way I feel now I could spit for six hours
Straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, if you can hear this sound in-
-side my head sounds like a fucking drive-by
That's what the inside of my mind's like
Looking back on my career, even hindsights, tunnel vision, 5 mics
Never wanted that so bad, felt like-I-could-go-mad
Nomad with a notepad
Go Taz, spaz on these ho bags
That bother me, but I never wanna show that
Just don't act like it ever does
Even though you know that there will never come
A day someone blows past you, never was
Someone who's as dope as you ever was
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you
Couldn't let somebody be better than you
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back
What you gonna go back into working a regular job?
Fuck that, I'mma go hard, grab on my, gonads
Tell them fuck theyselves
They call me a wigger like Renee Zell
But I raised hell like a stay-at-home dad
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at
Guess I'm similar to, gangrene when I'm, angry then I'm
Hulk Smash, so much passion but no compassion
If eyes are the windows to the soul
Then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassing
Alright now here we go
Dre stamped me now I'm stamping Yelawolf
Get ready for the most competitive
Clique in the world it's like Clash Of The Titans
I released the cracker it's time to set it again
And when it's said and it's all done
None shall ever fuck with this squadron
So come on in, at your own risk
This is (Our House) Bitch!
[Hook 2]

[Intro]
Oh I posted bail? I'm out this motherfucker? I can go?!
Aw, fuck ya'll! Ay fuck the judge!
Fuck the motherfuckin district attorney, the prosecutor
And fuck you motherfuckers in the jury box, fuck all ya'll!
Cause I'm out on motherfuckin bail
Y'all ain't never gon' see me in this motherfucker again!
Drop that shit Em
Let these ol' punk-ass bitches know how we runnin this shit
Niggas ain't goin back to court, you stank ass bitches
[Verse 1]
I'm stuck in jail, the D.A.'s tryin to burn me
I'd be out on bail, if I had a good attorney
Want to label me a criminal and cuff me up
Got a pocket full of money so they rough me up - I ain't trippin
In the county and I'm mad as fuck
Got a record so they put me with the baddest bunch
Everybody wanna talk cause I'm rappin, they askin' me what happened
Is it true you did a flick with Janet Jackson?
I can't sleep! They takin Polaroids
And I'm tryin to use the phone, but they makin noise
Man I wish I had my Glock, cause it's major
I'm makin shanks out the plastic in razors
These motherfuckers won't leave me alone, that's my word
Bout to turn a violation to a motherfuckin murder
I'm makin co-llect calls to my ol' bitches
Send mo' pictures, and make me some mo' riches
To all the suckers on the block, talkin shit while I was locked up
Be prepared to get socked up
Cause the game is deep, and the fame is brief
And you bullshittin bitches ain't changin me
I came straight up out the gutter, I was saved from hell
And I'm a thug, I was raised in jail, now I'm out on bail
[Hook]
(Out on bail) You know what fuckin time it is
I'm out on bail (thug life nigga) 50,000 BEYOTCH! I'm out on bail
(Out on bail) Hand me some motherfuckin cold 40's in this bitch nigga
Cause I'm out on bail (thug life nigga)
Ay pass me my motherfuckin Rolex
Yes bitch, that's a Presidential
[Verse 2]
I'm stuck in jail, and mad as a bitch
I'd be out on bail, if it wasn't for the snitch
Runnin wild through the streets like I'm loco
And fuck the punk police and they chokeholds
I got no love in my heart cause I'm heartless
Mobbin in the park after dark when I start shit
Rippin up the scene as a teen I was at it, hey
And sellin product to the addicts cause they gotta have it
I was a well-known thug and I got a lot of love
Hangin out with the O.G.'s, shootin up the clubs
And momma told me, don't hang with the homies
But they got me if they need me, den it's ON G
Got me sittin in a cell, a five by seven
Will I finally get to go to ghetto heaven?
Got my bitches on the outside, writin me letters
And they tell me they love me, and the shit'll get better
I don't believe 'em cause I just got the news on the wire
Take it how you want it but your picture's on fire
I gotta be a player so I stay strong
Cause I know that I won't be away long
And when I finally do hit the fuckin streets, I'mma handle this
A thug nigga gettin scandalous, I'm on bail
[Hook]
[Outro]
Motherfuckers tryin, to harass a player
Man I ain't goin for this ol' crazy ol' shit
Dealin with you scandalous bitches
Y'all need to pop some of these crooked ass motherfuckin judges
But here go the motherfuckin fetti, I'm out on bail
I'll see you motherfuckers at the next show
By the way, where is my bitch?
You know, that's that ol' real thug shit
Real live thug shit, genuine
Y'knahmsayin? I wouldn't waste yo' motherfuckin time with no bullshit baby
Trust me, it's that real shit
Talkin bout that shit you can be tellin your grandkids about y'know?
I ran with a thug nigga, believe that
This is for my fuckin nigga Em and the motherfuckin boys
In case you wonderin, we doin this shit, hell motherfuckin yeah
An ounce of that shit, sittin in yo' motherfuckin lap
Now press rewind nigga

[Intro: Eminem]
Nah, we ain't done!
[Eminem]
I love being hated, it's great, it, let's me know that I made it
I wouldn't have it no other way, I wouldn't trade it for the world
Only let's me know that I'm loved
By so many other motherfuckers that ain't you
And as long, as you keep fucking with us, we keep fucking you up
And keep pulling the rug from up under you
And what's ever more fucked up, is we enjoy what we're doing
So much there ain't nothing that we love more than "Pulling Your Skirts Up"
And exposing you hoes so much, people are starting to wonder
What's up with them fucking Wonder Woman underoos
Do unto others of you will have done unto you
So who the fuck you motherfuckers gonna run to
When someone runs up with a mask and puts a gun to you?
You gon' ask yourself, how come your mans
Didn't enter that last round that he had in Curtis Jackson's ass while he had the chance?
You keep asking us to 
keep it on wax
 but we can't
This is past any irrationalization
We have captured national media attention
Conversation is senseless, you can sense the tension start building
Soon as we enter the 106 & Park building
Someone's gonna get killed and I swear to God
If someone so much as even touches one of my people
I'll put a million on his head
And you ain't got the funds to match or counteract it
But I'd rather rap than get into this gangsta shit
And it ain't because I'm a bitch
It's because I ain't a bitch,
 
I don't endanger people that I'm with
I'm a general, I ain't Bush, I don't send my soldiers to war
I'm right there in the middle of the shit with 'em, so when I do get 'em
Orders to storm your headquarters, you'll be fucking with a
[Swifty McVay]
Fucking with a beef keeper, see you ain't eager to great this lyrical meat cleaver
That'll eat ya, niggas wanna keep speaking
Like it ain't even that deep
I got heat that'll sweep a nigga's street
See I wouldn't fuck with me neither, only heaven can help ya
I'll be searching for you longer than
 The Legend of Zelda
Without a failure, there's gonna be hell to tell the
Captain that a basset hound couldn't even smell ya
Body, when I hide ya, I be on that mob shit
You another Hoffa, under the Renaissance, bitch!
You get bombed like Lebanon with my own tactic
I snatch your head like one of Saddam's kids
[Obie Trice]
Motherfucker, I'll handle you, we can have it out on any avenue
An "Average Man"
 flipped into an animal
Shoot out your mandibles, cannons and ammunition
Reload with precision, nigga, know the mechanicals
Break the pistol down, you should see them handles
The street taught the child, no read up manuals
Pushing crack vows, 
young Nino Brown
Chasing green is the dream, when you're young and brown
Bound to be a problem child, look what I'm involved in now
A 'Dozen Dirty' niggas
 and they all get down
Resolve any problem that enlarge with ours
When revolvers we said "all men get down"
(Kuniva!)
[Kuniva]
While you're punching and tackling punks
I'm handling chumps, packing a pump
That's longer than the elephant trunk
On the streets I'm a beast, I feast upon the weak
So speak beef, I'll shoot you and scream "increase the peace"
A monster, pistol packing, pushing niggas off they Hondas
Stomp you, get it cracking, yanking bitches for they ganja
Sneaky as fuck, I don't think mama beat me enough
When she was sleeping stuff, I was stealing the keys to the truck
Shut the fuck up! Before you end up dead in the dump truck
Or in the streets taking a nap, bleeding and lugged up
"Who Want What?" like M. Bleek, 
with this heat if you ten deep
Then fuck it, it will be ten sleeping
[Proof]
Know much'bout Meyer Lansky,
 don't tussle with my hand speed
Clutch your burner, bust it and watch your man bleed
We ferocious, toast no holsters
Approach us, throw heat straight from the soldiers
We the soldiers, yall the youngsters (ha)
Youngsters lungs puncture, dead in a dumpster
Upstairs the monsters, hand full of drama
You scared of the drama, bomber the monster (Boof!)
I'm back nigga (Proof!), I reappear
Shoot like, homie ain't seeing clear
Blackness, carcass covered with cat fish
We murkers with no purpose other than practice
(Bizzy!)
[Bizarre]
There's three things I hate: liars, fakes and cheaters
Alcoholics, sluts and fucking wife beaters
I guess that describes my life
I don't even know who song this is 
(Obie Trice)
Bitch, Bizarre don't give a fuck about no hip hop
At my release party in a pink tank top and Reeboks
This Ja Rule beef I ain't getting in
I'll need an R&B singer to sing at my wedding
I'll turn your face into a fucking meat patty
I'll fuck your mommy and go fishing with your granny
I'll Shit on You, I'll pee on R. Kelly, too
This is Bizarre, see you "Devil's Night 2"

Now everybody from the 313
Put your mother-fuckin hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313 put your mother-fuckin hands up
Look, look
Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The Free World got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1pac, 
2pac
, 
3pac, 4
4pac, 3pac, 2pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pac, none
This guy ain't no mother-fuckin MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named cheddar bob who shoots
Himself in the leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
And never try and judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck i've been through
But I know something about you
You went to CRANBROOK, thats a private school
Whats the matter dawg, you embarrased?
This guy's a gangsta?
His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy dont wanna battle, he's shook
Cause ain't no such thing as halfway crooks!
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook
, 
fuck CRANBROOK
Fuck a beat I go accapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fuckin white trash I say it proudly
Fuck this battle I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here -- tell these people something they dont know about me

[Teller]
Don't kill me!
[Eminem]
Hurry the fuck up! *shoots the teller*
Thank you!
 
*running*
Go, go, go! What the..fuck? The fuck he go?
Mothafucka bail on me? Fuck you!
 
*car stops working*
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding me!
Are you fucking kidding me? Shit! *running*
Get off! *shoots a dog*
Ha-ha

Parking lot! Shit, ah!
[Officer]
Let me see your hands, bend over!
[Eminem]
Ah, fuck it! *shoots himself*

[Intro: 50 Cent]
Hey Em, you know you're my favorite white boy, right?
I owe you for this one
[Hook: 50 Cent]
I been patiently waiting for a track to explode on
You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on
If it feels like my flow's been hot for so long
If you thinking I'mma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm innocent in my head like a baby born dead, destination heaven
Sit and politic with passengers from 9/11
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine
God's the seamstress that tailor fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand writing lines knowing the Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world I'm similar to a squirrel
Looking for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today my phone'll stop ringing again
These industry niggas ain't friends, they know how to pretend
[Hook]
[Bridge: Eminem]
If you're patiently waiting to make it through all the hating
Debating whether or not you can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table they operating to save you
It's like an angel came to you sent from the heavens above
[Verse 2: Eminem]
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it
Shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray 'em 50
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this doc
Shit what you know about death threats, cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children, it's nuclear showers
There's nothing spookier
You now about to witness the power of fucking 50
[Hook]
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
If the gun squad hearing all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fucking top blown off
It's 50 - man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name
Niggas shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house
And if you got a glass jaw you should watch your mouth
Cause I'll break your face
Have your ass running, mumbling to the jake
You going against me, dawg, you making a mistake, I'll split ya
Leave ya looking like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper
The way I turn the money over you should call me flipper
Your bitch a regular bitch, you calling her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keeping her icey
I'm down to sell records, but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94: ''we don't love them hoes''
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinning looking mean on the six
Niggas wearing flags cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker
[Hook]

Em, it's Paul
Listen, Joel just called me and
He said you're in the fucking back behind his studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around
Like an idiot, outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself in trouble
Don't bring your gun outside of your home you can't carry it on you
Leave your fuckin' gun at home

Hey Em, its Paul, uh, listen I just gotta call from the label
And your probably not gonna be surprised but, um
Michael Jackson is extremely upset about the Just Lose It video
And, um, I mean he's pissed, so I don't know what he's gonna do
But we gotta talk about how were gonna handle this
Um, oh yeah, anyway, somebody told me that, um
They heard a rumor that you gotta new gun
Um, I know its probably not true
But I just need to talk to you about that
So, um, gimme a call

Em, what’s going on?
It’s Paul. Uh…
Dre gave me a copy of the new album
And I just…*sigh*…Fuck it!

Em? It's Paul
Ah, I just listened to the entire album
You gotta be fucking kidding me
I mean with this Christopher Reeves shit?
You know the guy's dead right?
And then the whole gay stepfather incest rape thing?
I don't have your back on this one
I can't even fucking handle it, I'm done

Hey, what's going on?
This is Paul Rosenberg, your faithful attorney at law
Listen, I listened to the rough copy of your album
And uh... you know I've just got to be honest with you
Can you tone it down a little bit?
Because there's only so much I can explain
Give me a call

[Produced by Eminem]
[Intro: 50 Cent]
When you're breaking it down, keep breaking it down
This is what it sounds like when I'm breaking it down
Yeah, I'm breaking it down
Man, this is what it feels like when I'm breaking it down
When you're breaking it down, keep breaking it down
It's not my fault, it's not my fault

We headed to the hotel after the show

[Hook: 50 Cent]
On your mark, get set girl now here we go

Ready or not shorty now here I come

Work it, work it girl you turn me on
When you're breakin it down, keep breakin it down
[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
They say I'm not the same it's cause I'm filthy mayne
I'm off the chain, I don't play no games
I'm hustlin hard homie I do my thang
You fuck with the paper then watch the hammer go bang
Now shorty I like the way she move them hips
I'm tryin to get her in my bedroom and shit
We could take a long time or get it done quick
We can camcord this shit make a boom-boom flick
It's oh so many places that we can go
I really want you shorty, shorty now you should know
Girl your body's callin me, hear you loud and clear
We ain't got to leave now we can do it right here
[Hook]
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
The way you move (the way you move)
You make me lose (you make me lose)
All control (all control)
I know you know (I know you know)
You're so seductive you make me wanna touch it
I ain't got to tell you, you know I wanna fuck you
I'm feelin your style, you better watch me now
My tongue'll be in your mouth, my hands'll be in your blouse
When you get me aroused you put a spell on me
Man if I can't have you I'mma go crazy
I want you bad now and if you want me
Girl come to me now, I said come to me now
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Come to me now, you don't come to me now
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch
Shackled in the house, 
I'll be back in about
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage
From the moment I met you had to let you know
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still {*phbbt*}
I shouldn't have to say it shorty you should know
I hope you really gettin into my creep show
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down
[Hook]
[Outro: 50 Cent]
It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I could break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
I can break it down, it's not my fault c'mon, it's not my fault
Can you break it down? It's not my fault c'mon

EMINEM YOU FUCKING BITCH

I'm ice grilling you, staring you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, cause Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac with a cranium packed full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head,
 
spasmodic
Strapped to a crafmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in a hospital in critical condition
I flat lined, jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed,
 
IV full of Thai-weed
Looking Chinese with my knee's, stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groins like lesbians
Pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope god forgives me for my sins
It probably all depends on if I keep on killing my girlfriends

[Eminem]
Yo yo, back again
Ha-ha-ha (Agh!)
Turn it up a little bit, pick it up pick it up
Yo pick it up, pick it up
Yo pick it up
If you find a phone call in a Tim Westwood line, what the hell you gonna do?
Pick it up! Pick it up!
[Proof]
If your ball falls out with a pad on the floor, what the hell you gonna do? (Pick it up! Pick it up!)
[Eminem]
While I'm smacking up girls to keep the hoes in check
The double S-Slim Shady wreck the London set
Sit back and relax while my squad smokes crack
And tap your man back and be like (Did you see that?)
Ah yes, coming from the mother freaking Midwest
Lift your shirt up and let me see them big breasts
We molest girls three times a day, three times a night
I got G-fulls of criminal peoples
Jumping out when we ten deep
Beat you down and speed off in a Benz Jeep
Brothers be like: Eminem changed his style up!
Shut the hell up, I'm still seven miles slut!
It's '97 so get with it
Peep that back in the day stuff when that Infinite tape was hitting
Listen, must we forget
I originated all that rough shit, that talk drug shit
That left motherfuckers who said our sound like [?]
Detroit city is where I grew up bitch
Peace to all my Outsidaz in Jers
Forget what you heard, this is three and one third
[Proof]
If you got an STD and your penis falls on the floor (What the hell you gonna do?)
Pick it up! Pick it up! (Ahhh yeah yeah yeahhh pick it up, pick it up)
If you see a Slim Shady tape on the fucking rack
What does Dre do? (ooohhhh)
(On the uckin rack, on the uck without the f)
[Eminem]
I get deaf MCees stepped to the left
I bust MCees and my name is Wyclef
How you doing? I play the banjo, piano whatever it is I rock like 
Barry Manilow
Yo it's Slim Shady on the freaking deck
Y'all don't check it out I wreck the Frim Shady set
The Frim Shady is what I said because I'm freaking drunk
I pick it up, pick it up, I sound like a punk
[Proof]
Ayo they wish that they could ban me black
Yo, you standing back
Def methods, ayo got my hand in that
Who ever running it, ayo you get a jammed knee cap
Make the healthiest in your fam, handicap
You a fan of rap, my clan will tap your school, home, ya bitch house
Pull my 
nine millie
, you gonna die with your fist out
Enemas is over with
Venomous is cobra spit
Aggressive dialect with aggressive sober pitch
My bionic phonics, demolish your logic, demonic can't stand the chronic impossible to hold on like vomit
Mics I palm it, cause they the bomb-it
Like terrorist is Islamic, I enter your atmosphere like a comet
The new god of rap, call me bigger Thor
Snap your back when I slap your ass in a figure four
From miles around they can feel us lethal
I make hardcore groups like Wu Tang sound like the village people (haha)
Be no sequel, of the energize, finish style, bust 'em down right now, the winner is... me
Then my man 
Mr. Paul
 we gonna star
Make your heart beat for your trying get down with us
We ball to the end, it's time to pretend
My friend to the left of me, the death of me
Me recipe to be with this don't even test MCees
Y'all can't get with us it's the dress, dress on ya

Dear Neymar,
I wrote to you but you still aren't responding
I left my Skype, my email, and my LinkedIn at the bottom.
I sent two letters back in April, you mustn't have got them.
There may have been a problem with the translation or something
.
On occasions my secretary transcribes my dictations incorrectly.
In any case: sod that, how are you? How's the old vertebra?
I'm going to adopt a poor favela boy, and be a remote sponsor.
And guess what. I'm going to call him for the good of the game?
I'm going to name him 'Jogo Bonito'.
I read about your noation's socio-economic problem, I'm sorry.
I had a friend whose second home had dry rot, so a similar story.
I know you probably hear this a lot, but I'm your fondest admirer. I've even seen YouTube footage of you at 
Portuguesa Santista
.
I've got a room full of your posters and your pictures, old boy.
I like what you've done with the game we invented; it's such a joy.
Anyway, I hope you get this chap, 
répondez s'il vous plaît,
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan
This is Winter.

[Intro: Bizarre and Swifty]
Yeah, welcome to Amityville
 
(Detroit, nigga!)
The reason why rappers gotta pack pistols
 
(Why is that?)
[Hook: Eminem]
Slick criminal wit,
 
the shit I spit chews
Like a bullet came back that just missed and hit you
I say the type of shit parents slit their wrists to
Need an anthem to amp you, then this the shit to
Too many enemies on my list to sift through
Nobody got my back in this bitch but this two
Sorry officer I don't care how pissed it get you
But I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
[Background]
Ain't going nowhere without my gun
I walk the streets I pack my gun
I go to sleep I got my gun
Don't go nowhere without my gun
[Verse 1: Swifty]
Nigga, we violently active, so fuck with us
See I'm backwards, I slap niggas and punch bitches
Just for asking, 
they musta been wanting to meet the Lord
When my parents talked to me, they got mean mugged and ignored
They were snooping through my closet, seen drugs on the floor
Shells from the 44 scattered over they porch
Busting pistols in your windows with intentions to destroy you
Tryna break your neck to conversate? Bitch, I'll do it for you
Catch me laughing at your funeral when they lower you
You and your ho, you gots to go, bitches died slow and horrible
There's no tomorrow for any nigga we'll shower you
We young strapped and powerful and I ain't gotta lie to you
[Verse 2: Proof]
Stepped in the door,
 waving the 
44
Blazing at po-po,
 escaping and 
lay low
They call my tongue 
ya-yo,
 
but I spit fire
I lit five inside a fucking dick-rider
The clip slider,
 
love to blast a Mag
You a fag, you love being ass to ass
Grab a gun by the nose with the butt to gat-spank ya
Never say that I'm a gangsta (Now that's gangsta)
Y'all niggas sound like Jigga but act like
 
Pac
Yo my trigger got the flu and this gat might cough
It ain't nothing to tell, empty shells for the witness
I'm the hot nigga that's gon' put hell outta business
It won't be the same since we touching the game
Make the hardest nigga in your crew, tuck in his chain
Y'all think this shit's a game and I'm bluffing for fame?
I'll squeeze off this tec until nothing remains
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Kuniva]
The only time that I'm at peace is when I'm close to one
Cause I don't know what's waiting for me when my vocals are done
Tote the gun, it's my way of life and it works
These cowardly niggas'll put your fucking life in the dirt
Cause it was wrong how they left my dog, he was priceless
Alone in the streets, bleeding, staring, laying lifeless
That's why I'm heated, you never know who starts creeping
Waking you up with 
AK's
 while you lie sleeping
I'd rather pack the heat and not need it
Rather than need one and not have it, I married this 
Glock-matic
[Eminem]
Nowhere without my..
[Verse 4: Mr. Porter]
You know the sound when I'm spinning round
Spitting these rounds from four pounds
While the whole crowd screaming as loud
From they mouths as they possibly allow?
Nothing is parallel to making you carousel
Aerial somersault like ferris wheels to a pair of shells
Denaun carry 
the nine
 where I go
Bullets whistle and hit you while I'm shooting at 5-0
Some semi-automatic for static's the motto
Spitting like 
*Eric Harris*
 from Colorado
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
This 
nine'll
 turn a softy to a hard rock
It'll make Jehovah's Witnesses, think before they knock (Sorry, sorry!)
It'll make your grandmother come outta her purse
It'll make Limp Bizkit, get rid of Fred Durst
It'll make Holyfield start fighting
It'll make Mase say fuck church and go back to writing
It'll make Shyne say he sound like Biggie Smalls
It'll make R. Kelly, give respect to Aaron Hall
It'll make Christopher Reeves start walking
It'll make a dog with no voice, suddenly start barking
It'll make a nun turn to a filthy slut
It'll make the hardest pitbull, turn to a fucking mutt
It'll make a Muslim dye his hair blonde
It'll make a redneck start to read the Holy Qu'ran (Need Jesus!)
It'll make Ike stop beating Tina
It'll make Slim Shady fall back in love with Christina
[Hook]
Outro:
Swifty: Hah, nigga, nigga you better have aim, cause if you don't - you're finished
Eminem: Sorry officers
Swifty: Flat out
Bizarre: Detroit
Eminem: 
Sorry *cops*, fuckin' *pigs*
Bizarre: The fuck we stay at
Swifty: Fuck around and get popped, with no hesitation, straight up
Bizarre: Look where the fuck we stay at, nigga look where the fuck we stay at. Fuck around with us.. You get us popped.. Fucking get us popped... Ahahaha you get us popped!

[Eminem] O. Trice, c'mon!
[Obie Trice]
Yeah, niggas got me
I'mma get them, it ain't over
[Hook: Obie Trice]
You can catch me in the whip with a fifth of pimp juice (yeah!)
Then I'm popping the clip, bout to fix this issue (woo!)
You pray that I don't hit, I ain't equipped to miss you (no!)
You're gonna need an ambulance to stitch your tissue (nigga!)
Or either have a bag on your hip to shit through (ha!)
You seen us on the ave, anxious to get you
But my penis is a mag, when I lift it hits you (DA-DA-DA-DA-DA!)
Cause I don't go nowhere without my pistol pistol
[Verse: Obie Trice]
I, solemnly swear on my, daughter's tears
The nigga that got him in the head will feel it before the year ends
(That's right) Hope you inconspicuous, my friend
Cause once the word get back, you in a world of sin (sin)
Bullets will hurdle at him, for trying to murder what's
Been determined as the first solo African (me!)
To go platinum with an accident happening
Well maggots I'm alive with vengeance to get back (get back!)
My momma blood pressure was affected from that
My little girl need her daddy on the phone at a certain time
Exact now
, and niggas act wild (foul)
But when the mac come out, y'all niggas exile (blaow!)
And I don't wanna hear X-Y-Z
I'm X'ing out your whole entity for trying to kill me
 (me nigga)
Filthy motherfuckers, I'll show you what real be (real be nigga)
When these HTB's light up your kidneys (woo!)
I'm so sincere, you see in a hearse this year
It's not a verse it's a curse from birth and what's on your person over here
This is Obie hear him clear, niggas beware
We're coming at you with firearms in air (yeah nigga!)
And your purpose so superfluous
How could I be merciful when murking me's a mercenary's goal? (uh)
Nigga I got paper, I'll have ya ass urgently exposed (what!)
No emergency's bringing back your souls
Slugs shatter your bones for pat-patting me in the dome
Learn this patter-in, we catch him at home, he wrong
That's when automatics sporadically catch him in the abdomen
Another dirty motherfucker's gone (YEAH!)
[Hook]
[Outro: Obie]
"
Second Round's on Me
" (robbin, shootin, killin, murder)
Oh shit RUNNN! (robbin, shootin, killin, murder)

{*guns cocking then one gunshot*}
[Eminem] Haha
[Ca$his] Ca$his, Ca$his
[Eminem] Yeah!
[Ca$his] 
King Mathers
[Eminem] C'MON!
[Ca$his] Pistol poppin, come get me nigga! {*echoes*}
[Hook: Ca$his]
Pistol poppin, bodies droppin, layin all around
You thought it was a game, now the neighbors callin out
The police find that, what's that sound?
While you layin on the ground with your fuckin brain out
[Ca$his]
Walk through the door with my hands on a gun
Cause niggas 'round here wanna ask where I'm from
I throw up my signs, step back and pop one
'fore you throw up your sign if you even got one
I used to bust niggas heads open for fun
Chase him down, stomp him out, if he tried to run
I could flip packs, get stacks, big straps, where it at?
Slung crack, real cat, you ain't never did that
Go hard, no peace, I gotta keep, chrome heat
I don't sleep, homie I'm watched by the police
Cops out patrolling, grab a Glock-40
Sniper at the squad car, story noting
Fuck it if you want beef, click-clack, wack rap
Tossed straps before, I'm out of here, homie
Militant in a sense, I don't really give a shit
Call up, Eminem, I gotta plead innocent
[Hook]
[Ca$his]
Sixteenth in my sneakers, I ain't listen to my teachers
I'm the most hated nigga alive, since Jesus
Maybe in the afterlife they'll reveal my Christ-like abilities
Come back, then ride on my enemies
Never been afraid of beef, metals of my bravery
War situations got you sayin he, crazy G
And emerge with the beat, I can serve anything
Especially anybody tryin to diss my team - Shady
{*blam*} G-Unit, Aftermath the same thing
So if you say them punk nigga you say me
I be in L.A. G, get at me when you see me
Catch you in O.C., and in the bag you'll be leaving
I ain't worried 'bout my freedom cause for me to get even
Is worth e'rything, it's on B.B.G.N
I son'd you folk, I'm lookin at your pinkie
You a fake-ass gangsta, what a waste of my scenery
[Hook] - 2X
[Eminem]
Maybe I just feel like there's too many pussies in rap
Shady (Ca$his) we gotta push 'em to the back
Move 'em along, push 'em aside, don't get me wrong
I love the finger snaps and the claps into the song
It's got a catch but come on man, the raps
We all gotta step our game up
; 
especially these lame fucks
Who walk around with their chest out
Just tryin to be down with anybody who's left now
Better be down with them, huh
But I dare some bitch to say somethin about, Eminem
Cause I'm not in the mood to be playin around with dudes
I already seen two friends get shot in the head
And lay on the ground this year and, one didn't make it
Proof, you are the truth
Please don't let us come face to face with these boo-boo-hoo
Fake-ass tattooed havin
Fif' please tell 'em right now how hard it has been
For me to try and, stay out it
But they just won't quit runnin their mouth
At least 'til there's a gun in it; son of a bitch!
We all got shooters, yeah these days who doesn't?
And as far as the snaps and claps, I wasn't
Dissin the South, that isn't what this is about
I just so sick of the beef, I don't even wanna see anymore
[Hook] - 2X

[Intro]
Yeah
Shady....
Aftermath.....
G-UNIT!!
[Hook]
I got places to go, got people to see
The penitentiary ain't the place for me
I'm warning you, do not tempt me
I'll run up and squeeze it, put a hole in you
[Verse 1]
You mistaking me for somebody that you should be testin'
You should be stressing, I'm fitting to fucking teach you a lesson
Rap 101's in session, Em laced the track that I'm blessin'
Smith and Wesson's the weapon in case you was guessin'
Capping 'em, kept in my Benz, hot beginning to end
Watch the 22's spin
, my hoes they perfect ten
I got shot up but I got up and I'm back at it again
Motherfuckers that thought I wouldn't win pretend to be friends
At first you fail, try, try, try, try again
I'm the best, don't you get it? Forget it, when I spit it, it's crazy
You love it, admit it, you like that I live it, it's Shady
Aftermath in your ass, bitch
If it's not a classic when it's done we trash it
Flow I got it mastered, stunt and get your ass kicked, bastard
When measures get drastic, Glocks made out of plastic
Cock it, aim it, blast it, run nigga, now stash it
[Hook]
[Bridge]
If there's a genie in a bottle of that Dom Perignon
I'mma drink til I get to that bitch
Em and Dre gonna introduce me to the 'burbs
They gonna listen to my words
In the hood they feel my shit
(Break it down)
[Verse 2]
Picture a perfect picture, picture me in a pimp hat
Picture me starting shit, picture me busting my gat
Picture police mad they ain't got a picture of that
Picture me being broke, picture me smoking a sack
Picture me coming up, picture me rich from rap
Picture me blowing up, now picture me going back
To my momma's basement to live, shit, picture that
Where I'm from it's a fact, you gotta watch your back
You wear a vest without a gat, you's a target, Jack
Hustle hard, money stack, sell that dope, sell that crack
Sell that pack, sell that gat, sell that pussy, holla back
50 Cent, too much Henny, man, I'm bent, I'm outta here
[Hook]
[Outro]
Man, I ain't' going to jail, not even to visit a nigga
You wanna holler at me you write me
Matter of fact you gotta send it to Sunset Blvd up in the Mondrian
Riding around in one of Dre's Ferrari's, nigga
Oh, matter fact, I might be in Detroit riding down 8 Mile Road
You know, in one of Em's joints and shit, you heard?
I got places to go man, you know
Shady Aftermath, we fitting to start printing money
Putting Em's faces on these motherfucking bills, shit
Ain't shit you can do about it

[Crooked I]
Fuck the whole world man, we are the freshest
I'm higher than a baby on a seesaw with Precious
Y'all just the messengers, we are the message
You bang on wax, I beef off the record
Rap like I trap, you can't spit this flow
I slang water, slang flour, I'mma get this dough
Behind my zipper where her lipstick go
Like an embryo in a hooker, I'm in this ho
[Royce da 5'9"]
Nickel!
Right off the rip, 
nigga we are the dopest
Y'all in front of the camera, we are the focus
Y'all are the watered down, we are the potent
Y'all call y'all bosses, we call the GOAT
 then
We ball fo' sho' and, here we are fast cats, fly
Me and bombs over baghdad, B.o.B
The only thing I hate to see is hate
In the place to be
[Hook: B.o.B]
What an incredible place to be
Away from the bullshit, I'm fading slowly
Ain't no other place I'd rather be
Away from the lowlifes surrounded by money
What about nines and super freaks?
Bottle of patron, just roll that green
Put it down for the team
So while my bill is getting ends, take another shot
What an incredible place to be
[Joell Ortiz]
I'm feeling like Cassius, at last it's the greatest
Angry intelligent rap, mad innovative
Y'all blast garbage shit, we blast the haters
Hip Hop's a community, we smack the neighbors
The last men standing when the shit get real
When the rest up we stepped up like a 6 inch heel
I'm getting used to how this rich shit feel
But don't judge me, 
I'm doing my best to make my dick sit still
[Joe Budden]
Fresh in the strip club, he be the realest
Drugs got her number, she feel this
I said I need a lover for an hour, not anything like a spouse
Told her the roof's missing, but everything's on the house
Got a table full of liquor, somethings gotta hit the spot
She might even put them on the glass if we mix a lot
Get her nice and buzzed
The night'll end when we decide it does
[Hook]
[B.o.B]
You already know nigga, 
we be's the flyest
You might've seen high, but nigga we get the highest
Far as lighters, I need at least a 3 week supply with
Now all this pussy thrown at me, now I'm knee deep in 'gina
Bitch I'm bossin',
 fuck around and 
unleash Goliath
I go deep and get your poon all wet, call me Poseidon
I'm a giant, I eat beats and I burn good, that's my diet

[Verse 1: Chaos Kid]
Get up this morning, I'm feeling sleepy as all hell
Went the use the bathroom when I tripped and I fell
All the way downstairs onto the couch
And I pissed my pants on the way down south
So I went back upstairs to change my underwear
Took a while to get em unstuck from my pubic hair
Finally got unzipped
 I went to put em down the street
But then I threw em in the garbage cause it all said pew
Hopped in the shower
 put shampoo in my hair
Went to rinse it out but then the water wasn't there
That damn toilet it must of went foul
Got another bath to wipe the stuff up with the towel
Went to get my clothes but I couldn't wear the wash
So I sat and played some Mario on my Nintendo
I was gonna see my girl but I forget that stuff man today
I just feel like a pooh butt...
[Hook-2x]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feeling like a pooh butt today
[Verse 2: Chaos Kid]
Now every single day I make habits to get up
But today I just feel like a pooh butt so ill stay in bed
I dont know whats wrong with me, I'm just taking everything nonchalantly
I just feel like I can't move one muscle
My girlfriend calls me up and tells me now we gotta hustle
My plane leaves to roll about quarter to 8
It's 7:15 looks like I'm gonna be late
Aww forget that baby said I just can't make it
I know you're disappointed but your gonna have to take it
I'm sick in bed I'm making [?] foot it but before hung up the phone she told me where I could put it
Comes next day 
I got a call from M&M he said
(We gotta make a record get ya butt outta bed) I said I ain't doin nothing I wish you nothing but luck he said (What's up?) I said I feel like a pooh but...
[Hook]
Sometimes things just never go my way you know i, im just feelin like a pooh butt today
[Break]
(Chaos Kid) "yo you ever have one of those poohie stinky ridiculous rotten days, M&M" (M&M) "man I had one once check this out"
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Woke up, 6:30 in the morning, yawning
Gotta get to the
 recording studio
I gotta get a take done
Put all my rhymes together so I can make one
Get outta bed, fall on my head
Slipped on the rug, I thought I was dead
Cussin', I think my head is busted but it's really nothing
Only a concussion, shake it off
, 
get off the ground
Look around couldn't find my rhyme sheets; Where'd I put em down?
They were just there last night on the chair
Had to look everywhere but couldn't find em anywhere
Go to the basement might of misplaced em
Gotta find em in hurry but my visions still blurry
Goin' down the stairs what could happen next
But, when its this early you can't skip steps;
Fallin head first -- As I fall, I curse
Things are lookin' bad, I'mma only get worse;
Aching I shake and I hurt I stand up slowly
Wiped all the dirt off memory lapse
I can't remember nothing, think I'll collapse
If you forget the whole thing pause for a second
What was I looking for? Oh yeah, my rhyme sheets
They might be on the floor or on the chair
Wait a minute where am I? I'm in a basement
Damn, how does time fly? Think for a second
Record my memory if I were a rhyme sheet where would I be??
Now I remember I put em in the closet next to my jacket
So I woulda never lost em
Already seven, I've only got an hour to eat breakfast
Get dressed
, 
plus take a shower got undressed
Got the zest off the rack
Turn the water on and I almost had a heart attack;
Cold as hell, started to yell jumped out the shower
And said fuck it, I'll smell
Grabbed the towel off the rack, dried off got dressed
Still had to eat but my hair was a mess
I was in a rush, grabbed the brush
And ran into the door on the floor I land
Always to fate now; I know I'm cursed
I think it might help if I open the door first
Tried to turn the handle but I sprained my wrist
But that's what happens on a day like this...
[Hook]
Sometimes things just never go my way
You know I'm just feelin' like a pooh butt today
[Break]
(Chaos Kid): Wow, that sounds pretty poohie to me
(M&M): Now, I'm gonna break it downfor those who don't know what a pooh butt day is
[Outro: Eminem]
Now, a pooh butt day is something everybody's had
No particular depression neither mad or sad
You couldn't see your butt because your butt is what it is
Cause when your feeling like a pooh butt
Then you're feeling like shit

[Produced by Dr.Dre]
[Intro: 50 Cent]
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
Yeah, yeah, I can hear your heartbeat, you're scared
[Hook: 50 Cent]
You see I'm a psycho, a sicko, I'm crazy
I said I got my knife pulled, I'll kill you if you make me
They wanna see me shot up, locked up, then cage me
I come back bigger, stronger and angry
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, look look, I come from a different crew, you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop, a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, nine, trey pound or forty fo'
Pick a strap, The Tec, the Mac, the Hawk, I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains, I know your name and where you rest, I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest, you cough up blood till EMS
Come pick you up, you know you're fucked when you get on the stretcher
Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through, it is nothing new to it to me
They lock me up, they let me out, you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get, a nine, then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one, they found a gun, now they doing ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint, the shit's going terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Man, these are average raps, I'm keeping the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath lid
You pop off the top, it's like opening vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with a Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch, yeah, there's something to jack a batch in
Impregnated then shoot up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
Dead fetuses falling out all over,
 
Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratched the surface like my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fucking backyard still trying to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searching for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us, but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killing so villainously
Still as maniacal on the NyQuil and psycho as Michael Myers
You know what we're like on the motherfucking mic so try us
And you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
It's operation time, they got him hooked up to wires
Squeezing, he bleeding wheezing, breathing he half dead
He must ain't know, but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Lead showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn
School of arts, Julliard, you better learn learn
[Verse 5: Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah, homie, turn turn
I'm debating mutilating the lady
You've been waiting for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicating it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's, I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub
[Verse 6: 50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky it'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up, get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk, witness this shit, end up nauseous
Look deep in my eye, see many many men die
I swing gem stars faster than a Samurai
[Hook]

[Intro]
Hello
What up?
Hello?
Yo, I can't, I can't hear you
Let me call you back
[Verse]
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon?
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky
Right outside the window of my living room
And if they do you can say good night and bye-bye to them iTunes
If I don't try to record as much before I do
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can
As I stand before you in this booth a walking dead man
Blank stare, dead pan, look on my face as I gaze into space
As I wait to be scooped up in that van
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere
And I'll go down in the history
As the bloodsucking leech who hid behind the freedom of speech
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it
And ended up dying the villain, not the hero
Splendid, stupendous way to end this,
 
I can feel the tremors tremendous
In remembrance of September 11th
Flash back to September 7th when 2Pac was murdered in Vegas
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it
Should we ever live to regret it
Like that day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day
By the greatest lunatic with a gun
Who just happened to work on the same block in the library book depository
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll
Shots fired from the grassy knoll
But they don't know, or do they?
Who's they, for them to say "Touché"?
We're all vulnerable and it's spook-ay
This is about as kook-ay, as I've ever felt now
Count down to nuclear meltdown
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one
You can run, you can do what you want to
But you know you ain't gonna do nuttin'
When it's time, it's your time
You are the prime target
You have become Public Enemy number one

[Announcer: Jeff Bass]
This is another public service announcement
Brought to you, in part, by Slim Shady
(Tell 'em I don't give a fuck)
Slim Shady does not give a fuck what you think
(Tell 'em to suck it)
If you don't like it, you can suck his fucking cock
(Tell 'em they kissed my ass)
Little did you know, upon purchasing this album, you have just kissed his ass
(Tell 'em I'm fed up)
Slim Shady is fed up with your shit, and he's going to kill you
Uh... anything else?
[Eminem]
Yeah... sue me!

[Jeff Bass]
This is a public service announcement brought to you in part by Slim Shady
The views and events expressed here are totally fucked
And are not necessarily the views of anyone
However, the events and suggestions that appear on this album
Are not to be taken lightly
Children should not partake in the listening of this album
With laces in their shoes
Slim Shady is not responsible for your actions
. 
Upon purchasing this album,
 
You have agreed not to try this at home
. 
(a-anything else?)
[Eminem]
Yeah. Don't do drugs

[Intro]
*Eminem puking into a toilet*
There I go--thinking of you again
[Hook]
You don't know how sick you make me
You make me fucking sick to my stomach
Every time I think of you, I puke
You must just not know--whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa--whoa--whoa--oo!
You may not think you do, but you do
Every time I think of you I puke
[Verse 1]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem
But off of the dome would probably be a little more
More suitable for this type of song--whoa
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I could think of
Sixteen bars,
 
this ain't enough to put some ink to
So fuck it, I'mma start right here I'll just be brief I'm
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo of you
On my arm, but what do I go and do?
I go and get another one, now I got two
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
Now I'm sitting here with your name on my skin
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim
Shi-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-it
If you only knew how much I hated you
For every motherfucking thing you ever put us through
Then I wouldn't be standing here crying over you
Boo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-who
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter
But I thought a song would probably be a little better
Instead of a letter
That you'd probably just shred up--yeah
I stumbled on
 
your picture
 
yesterday and it made me stop and think of
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink to, a stupid piece a
Paper, I'd rather let you see how
Much I fucking hate you in a freestyle
You're a fucking coke-head slut, I hope you fucking die
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye
I hate your fucking guts, you fucking slut, I hope you die
Di-ii-ii-ii-ii-ii-ie
But please don't get me wrong, I'm not bitter or mad
It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back
It's just that when I think of you, it makes me wanna
Yack-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-aa-ack
What else can I do? I haven't got a clue
Now I guess I'll just move on, I have no choice but to
But every time I think of you now, all I wanna do
Is pu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uu-uke
[Hook]
Fucking bitch

[Hook: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers
I down a couple downers
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
I been to mushroom mountain
Once or twice but who's counting
But nothing compares
To these blue and yellow purple pills
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of Valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
Roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by 6 people and 5 I hit
Ah shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids
These shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat until I start losing weight
Until I see dumb shit start happening
Dumber than Vanilla Ice trying to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce (gunshots)
I said come on bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce
Not weed I meant coke dumb ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passing out
Get her ass on the couch before she crashes out
[Verse 2: Kon Artis and Kuniva]
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
Hey Von, you see me stepping on these leprechauns?
It got to be acid cause the X is gone
Ya I took them all dog, with some parmesan
And I think my arm is gone
It's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he about to swallow his tongue
Scary ass it was a false alarm
You think I'm about to die when I just got on?
Well stop acting stupid
You so high
That you might wake up with a guy
On some new shit
I think I did too much
This substance equals cuffs
Red pills, blue pills, and green
Big pills (that's ill),
 
mescaline
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Dirty Dozen,
 
80 of us
Shady brothers
, 
ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers
Love us but they hate each other
They probably want to take each other out
And date each other
Some-, something, something, something
Something, something, something, something
[Verse 3: Proof]
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills, on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought I was incredible and killed the Hulk
I want to roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm old and gray
Look for dope to smoke, no? okey-doke
I'm packing my nose with coke
*coughing* Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ah, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I got to strangle a... you're crazy
[Verse 4: Swift]
I pop four E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowing mine
(Hey you got any shrooms?)
Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get job because our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggas think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
If you like 
smack
, then I might too
(Swift, chill)
I just want to get high like you
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue
Speed, shrooms, down the Valiums
Even smoke weed out of vacuums
I just 
copped
 some and I'm going back soon
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
I'm at a rave
Looking like a slave
High off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic
Body smell like vomit
Pussy popping, acid dropping, dope heady guy
Heroine mescaline pencil leads, want to try?
Blue pills, golden seals
Got Bizarre acting ill
Drugs kill (yeah, right)
Bitch I'm for real
Shut your mouth you dirty slut
You know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt
Let Bizarre nut
[Hook]
[Bridge]

[Eminem]
Yo, I dedicate to this to you
To all my fans, keeping y'all in health
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart condition and
Which I create, cause that's my mission
So listen close, to what we say
Because this type of fag claims to never be gay
I knew you was jealous from the day that I met you
I upset you, cause I get respect I bet you
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood
And said, heck, country western rap records are good
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year
Then 
Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year
No one's tryin to hear some fucking old fart in a chair
Sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career
I punch you in your fucking chest 'til your heart kicks in gear
And fuck 
your underground buddies' nameless crew
Like I'mma say they names so they can be famous too
[Hook X2]
You just a quitter
And you bitter cause I came along
And the days of House of Pain are gone
And if you talk about my little girl in a song again
I'mma kill you, I'mma kill you
[Verse 2]
Heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke
To the rap you wrote, your fuckin' answer back's a joke
And I'mma tell these motherfuckin' fans the truth
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you
Like I ain't notice you
Bitch, I had a show to do
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you
Took your motherfuckin' DJ and stole him too
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap
Quicker but never last, and Everlast is a
[Hook X2]
[Verse 3]
Aight listen
So this is what we ask of our fans
If you ever see Everlast, whoop his ass
Hit him with sticks, bricks, rocks, throw shit at him
Kick him, spit on him, treat him like a ho, bitch-slap him
Do it for me, do it for Fred, do it for Limp
Do it for Rock, do it for rap, do it for Kid
Do it for Ice-T, do it just to do it, fuck it
He's a bitch, he ain't gon' hit you back, he's nothin
Shit in five years we'll all be eatin' at Whitey's
And he'll be bussin tables in that bitch, cleanin the toilets
Aiyyo.. fuck this, cut this shit off
Aiyo Head...
That's why I fucked your mother you fat motherfucker
[Beat changes to 2Pac's "Hit 'Em Up"]
Kill Whitey
Kill Whitey, Detroit
What
What
Kill Whitey, yo, yo
Kill Whitey, haha, look
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip
Whitey Ford, 40 and white, lethargic ass dickhead
I keep 'em comin while you runnin' out of breath
Steady duckin' while I'm punchin' at your chest, you need to rest
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya
With your three CD's
Nobody sees, when they released
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's
You ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks
I let you faggots know it's on for life
But Everlast might die tonight
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know
[
Hook 2
]
Grab .380s when you see Slim Shady
Call the doctor to heal your heart
They shocked you back to life at the clinic
But you 'bout to get relapsed any minute
Honkey, I hit 'em up
Hahaha, yo check this out
You faggots ain't even on my level
I'mma let D12 ride on you bitch-made ass faggots
[Kon Artis]
Yo, get out the way yo, get out the way yo
Whitey Ford's heart just stopped
Eminem shocked him back
, he had another heart attack
Whitey Ford's gettin his ass floored for talkin' back
Little faggot Hamburgular
, 
I show you where the burgers are
At your own restaraunt, while I'm servin' ya
Drop and stomp your whole heart 'til it stops
Call the cops, I'mma beat your ass while they watch
[Kuniva]
Ha ha, now we got the whole industry makin fun of you Erik
Where's your House of Pain now
There's only one of you Erik
You a petty coward
You ain't ready to steady go a round
With some killers from 7 Mile to the motherfuckin' Belle Isle Bridge
[Hook 2]
[Eminem]
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still
This ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin' killed
With his chest open
Tryin to throw a fuckin' punch, but you just chokin'
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime
Cause you suck, motherfucker you should learn to rhyme
Talkin' about you packin' pistols but it's funny to me
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me
I'm a paleface killer whale
On his way to fuckin' prison
Pistol whippin' tail
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day
That shit was obvious you probably was gay
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop
49,000 copies the week your shit drop
While my sales making records break
2.5 million scanned by the second week
Motherfucker I hit em up
[Proof]
I'm from Detroit's Pemberton Ave
Where bullets tear you in half
Fuck the music
We got an uzi for all you fags
Get the shit out of our stereo, Dilated you violated
Now you 'bout to get annihilated, we gon' bury you
Iriscience get choked up and yoked up
All you underground bitches get your throats cut
[Swifty]
What the fuck
Is you stupid
I choke Whitey Ford with his fucking guitar cord
And stuff him in cardboard
Chopped up in a box
With sixteen parts
I stomped on his heart
D-12, Amityville, fuck your mother while you watch
Keep your restaraunt locked and block your door
Cause we "Hit 'Em Up" like motherfuckin 2Pac Shakur
[Eminem]
You a, 'Black Jesus,' heartattack seizures
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases
White devil, washed up honkey
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country
Yo, aiyyo cut this shit off
Fuck him!
That's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm sorry, I promise, I'm done, I'm sorry
I just believe in kicking a man while he's down
God-Damn! I quit!
Mention my daughter's name in a song again, you fucking punk. Aiyo!

[Eminem]
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits
My life's like one great big ball of shit
If I could just, put it all into all I spit
Instead of always trying to swallow it
Instead of staring at this wall and shit
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit
Can't call it shit
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall
If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it
I ain't dealing with another fucking politic
I'm like a skillet bubbling until it filters up
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up
Blow this building up
, 
I've concealed enough
My cup runneth over, I done filled it up
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts
You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts
Well I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch
Peel the Dutch, I'm about to tear shit up
Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see
What you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee
Out this world, ain't no one out their mind as me
You need peace of mind? Here's a piece of mine
All I need's a line
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme
To express how I'm really feelin' at that time
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes
It's just sometimes, it's always me
How dark can these hallways be?
The clock strikes midnight, one, two, then half-past three
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper
{*rip*} I'm desperate at my desk
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin'
Fuck I'm stumped, up wait, here comes somethin'
{*crumples paper*} Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out
I'm fizzlin' now, thought I figured it out
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?
Why am I a slave to this trade?
Cyanide I spit to the grave
Real enough to rile you up
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want
I'm a switch hitter bitch,
 
Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a
Fucking boiling point,
 
put some oil in your joints
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense
They hate me,
 
see me and shake like a chain-link fence
By the looks of 'em, you would swear that Jaws was coming
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawing someone
By the way they're running, you would swear the law was coming
It's now or never and tonight is all or nothing
Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest
I'll be back baby,
 
I just gotta beat this clock
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch
Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch
I found my niche, you gon' hear my voice
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung
If I have half a chance I grab it
 — 
Rabbit, run

Distorted, ordered by the court to be aborted
Snorted, right before these vocals were recorded
Morbid, too perverted- stay alerted
Went to the club, 
murdered the first slut that flirted
Deserted, abandoned by my mama and it hurted
The worst nut my daddy ever squirted
Screamin, cussin, buzzin when I'm bustin, open sores pussin
I need another dose of 
Robitussin
Fussin over nothing
An army couldn't calm me
Bitchin like a lady- shady like a 
What the fuck you call me- who you callin soft?
I'm still fresher than you- and bitch I'm fallin off
I'm horny, and corny girls won't even cross my path
I'm so dirty, I don't even wash 
my ass
Never took a shower, cower from a scower
Prowler, 
 out in half an hour
What's your flavor, how you want it, ripe or sour?
Rifle power
Snipe you from the

G-SHIT
[Bizarre]
Whattup
I gotta tell you motherfuckers the truth
This is straight G shit
And all you can do is respect it
[Verse 1: Swift]
Well I'mma state my name, Swift McVay
None of y'all niggas got shit to say
Rhymes keep coming off like a toupee
Plus I'm big headed running things my way
A selfish man, 
the back of the hand
Be slapping the hell out of hoes because I can
Prostitute, I want my loot
And I don't give a fuck about your broke-ass man and
Y'all giving niggas what they needing
'til bitches understand I'm mean and
Swift McVay is, blowing up
Courvosier
 
'til I'm throwing up
Wanna playa hate me, bitch so what?
What's yo' function? Where's yo' bucks?
All you wanna do is wanna stick him up
You wanna rob me but I got too much (hah)
D12, naturally lifted
You niggas better duck when I cock the biscuit
You fuck wit me, I fuck wit you
Your entourage, nigga fuck them too
I got grenades
What the hell your little twenty-two gon' do?
(Y'all ain't gon' shoot)
Y'all major soft
Cops getting mad cause I paid 'em off
, made 'em cough
Blood and shit
That's what the hell you motherfuckers get, we runs this bitch?
So hey, you ain't gotta be scared to fuck
If you want head, then prepare to suck (do it)
Even if the nigga don't care to nut
For every stroke, it's a hundred bucks
Respect the game, you just a slut
So open your legs up and get my duck
[Hook: Eminem (Dina Rae)]
You just a .. (ho)
You just my .. (ho)
Dirty-ass .. (ho)
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch
Go get my .. (dough)
Go bring me my .. (dough)
Dirty-ass .. (ho)
I'm yo' pimp, you my bitch
[Verse 2: Proof]
I don't spit game, no longer than my name
Then when my chain hang, my nuts do the same
Don't pay pussy, pussy pay me
Bitch, slut, whore or lady (yup)
And knowing the fact, I was born to mack
That's why I got a ho in the back, blowing my sac
Got good game,
 that's a hood thang
What'd you brang, loot or poo-tang?
Let 'em all bang, run that cheese
Tell that trick nigga (come back please!)
Rob a 
L7
, 
that's a square
You a bottom ho, you got to know
Off you I plan to make a lot of dough
So suck fast bitch, and swallow slow
{*swish-slap-swish*} (AH!) Bitch quit talking back
{*swish-slap-swish*} (AH!) Now walk the track
[Verse 3: Kon Artis]
I don't pay for ass, you pump my gas
You get slapped when we're short of cash
I get whiplash when I hit the gas
And I holla out the window of the hatch
Where's my scratch? Bitch, that's, it
Suck it stroke it make me rich
As a token of my appreciation it's
Another client for you to hit
I don't give a fuck if you gotta go home to the kids
You shoulda picked another occupation, trick
Now you're stuck with me, fuck with me
And I'mma slap you up in this truck
You must be out your mind or something
Crying and whining like you tired or something
Go suck some head until it aches for buffering
You don't work? You make nothing
I'm just another case of a lazy husband
[Verse 4: Kuniva]
I want the paper stack
Buy you an outfit, then take it back
When you page me, bitch, I never page you back
You only act a certain way that I make you act (whattup
)
Hoes recognize, and niggas do too
Cause they realize that niggas do shoot
Don't like a chick that act too cute
Bitch hold my gat down when I shoot hoop (oh yeah)
And don't be asking me, all kind of questions
All harassing me, calling stressing
Or I may have to release some aggression
Beat you to death and teach you a lesson
Looking for handouts like you my damn spouse
Pull your pants down and fuck my mans now
Shut your damn mouth or get in the damn house
Off with the damn blouse and suck on my damn crotch
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Bizarre]
Sell that pussy
Sell that pussy, bitch
Get out there and switch and go make Bizarre rich
You gotta itch, you fucking dirty bitch
Now get on the corner, and start sucking some dicks
Niggas want pussy, and I need cash
So mom, get out there and start selling yo' dirty ass
Bizarre quick to hit 'em, and then stick 'em
Fuck it; I'll let you hit one of my victims
(Somebody help I'm on 
7 Mile
 and ..)
Shut up bitch, you talk too much
Now you about to get fucked in your dirty butt
You never seen a pimp like me, out here whoring
Shut your fucking mouth and you'll be out by the morning
Cause I'm the dirties pimp, you ever heard of
Give me my five-thousand, and take this cheeseburger (bitch!)
Go suck dick at a bachelor party
So what if you on your period? blood never hurt nobody
[Hook]
[Eminem (Dina Rae)]
You just a .. (ho)
You just a .. (ho)
That's all you is .. (ho, ho, ho)
You just a, dirty ass bitch
A dirty ass, nasty ass, stinky ass, filthy ass, stanky ass bitch
(Oooh, ooh-OOOH) Hahahahaha... (lahhh-aHHH)
But I love you... (hahaha) .. Kim (mmm)
[Outro: 
Rondelle Beene
]
And there you have it god damnit, the fundamentals of pimping
You heard it here first, from the Dirtiest Dozen
You ever seen in yo' god damn life
Yo this is Rondell Beene on the scene
And we keep the pussyholes smiling, because 
we always wilding
YouknowhatI'msayin? Fuck all what everybody else talking about
We let you know right here
Big pimping, it ain't dead, we love getting head, in a dirty-ass bed
That's just what we do
You know we was throwing heroin pimp parties back in 1968
The pussy is all great
I'll see you at eight, bitch

Yeah
Definitely, definitely, definitely dope
Definitely, definitely K-Mart, yeah
Yeah
[Verse 1: Eminem]
You find me offensive
I find you offensive for findin' me offensive
Hence if I should draw out or line any fences
If so, to what extents if any should I go
Cause it's getting expensive
Bein' on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage to the brain
When I go to lengths, this
Far at other people's expenses
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this
And Christo-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either
He used to be like a hero to me I even believe I
Had one of those twenty-five cent stickers on my refrigerator
Right next to Darth Vader
And Darth must of put a hex on him for later
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor
I killed Superman I killed Super-man, and how ironic
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
[Refrain]
Cause I ain't got no legs
Or no brain
Nice to meet you
Hi my name is
I forgot my name
My name was not to become what I became with this level of fame
My soul is possessed by this devil,
 
my new name is
Rain Man
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now in the bible it says
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse for your actions
Either before during or after
Performing the act of that which
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way
But who's to say, what's fair to say
And what not to say
Let's ask Dr. Dre
 (What up?)
Dr. Dre, I got a question if I may (Yeah)
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend (Yeah)
And watch his butt butt when he tees off (Yeah)
But uh, I ain't done yet
In football the quarterback yells out hut-hut
While he reaches in another grown man's ass
Grabs on his nuts but just what if
It was never meant, it was just an accident
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit
And I don't need to go into any more details but
What if he pictured it as a female's butt
Is that gay
I just need to clear things up
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because
[Refrain]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
You find me offensive, I find you offensive
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this
When am I gonna come to my good senses
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses
My spider sense is tellin me Spider-Man is nearby
And my plan is to get him next
And open up a whoop ass canister
God damnit Dre, where's the God damned beat (Yeah)
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it
This is the only thing that I'm good at
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic
Demonic, yup yup, don't worry I'm on it
I got it
, 
high five Nick Lachey
Stuck a pin in Jessica's head and walked away
And as she flew around the room like a balloon
I grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can
And zoom, I headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich
And I don't even gotta make no God damned sense
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit
[Refrain]
[Eminem]
Cause ah ha ha ha ha
Yup, Rain Man
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre
Super dope, beatmaker
Two thousand, two thousand four-hundred and eighty-seven million
Nine hundred and se-seventy-three thousand four hundred and sixty-three
...and seventy (yeah)

Whoa Nelly, Tell Angelina Jolie I’m ready
With petroleum jelly, to smear it all over me belly
And tell her she can hit me on me mobile, me celly
And meet in the salami section of the grocery deli
And maybe we can find us an appropriate telly
A motel 6 or 8 it think they both could be helly
I hit it, then I quit it and I told her email me
And don’t call me, I’ll call you,
 
can you feel me? Ho do you smell me?
Animal instinct, cannibalistic, I just ran out of lipstick, man I’m a twisted, sick
Sadistic, son of a bitch, 666, Broke his crucifix made out of sticks then fixed it
Chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick chick!
Now play it backwards 
 mixed with liquid
Dilaudid its diluted for a quick fix
, 
your delusional illusions look realistic
..I Need 
 to come and lay his verse
I think he can spit it better on 
Medicine Ball
, 
first
Off I did not even realize the guy died
So I guess them Christopher Reeves jokes ain't gonna fly
Oh! I'm on a roll don't get me started
Anna got pissed at me and tried to push me into the garden
With such accuracy she aims and shoots the target
Cupid's arrow done forced it...
Now look sweetheart it's the, kissing bandit
On a mission to leave Ms. Degeneres Disenchanted
By men now just listen dammit
Mr. Rossi I need no posse I single handed-
-ly will steal your heart with a kiss where should I plant it
Moi! baby its Moi! and my repertoire
Is running around in 
 and leopard bra's
And negligah, negligée you say tomato I say tomah-to
I'm Tommy Motola Mariah don't stop me I'm on a roll
Oh!

Role Model?
I'll roll a model down a hill over broke bottles and coke products if she don't suck
And ? To the bumper hit the throttle while im tryna hit the pothose
I'll freakin take Madonna to McDonalds
Any ho in the porizontal getting fondeled
I don't cuddle I don't caddal
Only models that I follows
Everything I drive, whether it's a navo-ho or tatho
It's got a ho in it
Nah ho I don't got no freakin Bronco
You're looking for a buck? Get a horse ? tano
I got a rusty Honda with some bonda and a box of condoms
Little blonde Bitch Fuck me? Fuck you too
Like a Mcbanaro-boo-abano
And I ain't from this planet so nano - nano nano
I'm intolerable, too vilatle, screw it
I don't gotta make the Honor roll to be On a roll
I don't know much, But what I do know I do it pronto though
So knock it off all these knock-off me's
The last thing the world needs is another me
But if you think, this is part 2 to recovery
Or Love the way you lie part 12
Or something Heartfelt you're about to make a Discovery
Like you failed Christopher Columbus's compass
And dumb it down for you dumb fucks who suck it
I took your best punchline like a punch in the stomach that punctured a lung punk but I'm still functioning from it
Chump, this is nothing now watch, while i fuck one up it and toot my horn
Once i think of something to trumpet
And i don't need a fucking In-strument to sound off like a trunk of a elephant the triumphent
Return of the ether spittin' retard, reborn, but chances of you having another rebirth, slim to none
Like a skinny Mother Theresa, Give a fuck it's easter! So kiss my keester! Because that's the only thing i turn the other cheek for !

High on? What'd you say, trick? What am I on?
Two tubes of airplane glue and a can of Krylon
Eatin' a crayon,
 
settin' fire to rayon
Flamin' the nylons of two white lesbians screamin', "Die, blondes"
Strike matches on white patches of dry lawns
And I run and jump right in front of the fire hydrants
Five blunts,
 
and you expect me to die once
With nine lives,
 
fuckin' chickens in front of my blind wives?
Suicidal, my friends tell me to try knives
You wanna mess with a mothafucka who skydives
Out of a plane to give the Statue of Liberty high fives?
Doin' drive-bys and miss you with five tries
It's Slim Shady and BET and Big Tigger, all y'all see me flee

[
Intro
: Bizarre]
The rap game, 
hip hop 101
The hardest nine to five you'll ever have
You can't learn this shit in no history book
You ready to rap, motherfucker?
You ready to sell your soul?
 hahaha
The rap game will fuck you up
[Swift]
I'm a disrupted nigga, you made me crazy
You should've slayed me as a baby
Behaving shadier than Wes Craven
And you ain't even gotta pay me
I take pleasure of laying a nigga down daily
You face me, punk it's over, you'll faint fast
I'm never fucked up to where I can't whoop yo' ass
Your neck'll get snapped with bare hands, fuck music
Is he rapping? It's cool but fools, just don't confuse it
What happens: these dudes get rude then I lose it
I'm scandalous, I blow ya two niggas off 
the atlas
With a gat that's bigger than Godzilla's back nigga
You are not realer, in fact you'll feel the effects
Of a crack dealer, y'all presidents sends me smack
And got a mack 10 with it,
 
so I ain't gotta rap
But I'm thankful for that, don't mistaken me black
Or you'll be stanking in the back of a fucking Cadillac
[Eminem]
I'ma get snuffed, cause I ain't said enough to pipe down
I pipe down, when the {White House} gets wiped out
When I see that little {Cheney} dyke get sniped out
Lights out, bitch adios, goodnight {*gunshot*} (AHH!)
Now put that in ya little pipe and 
bite down
Think for a minute cause the hype just died down
That I won't go up in the Oval Office right now
And flip whatever ain't tied down upside down
I'm all for America, fuck the government
Tell that C. Delores Tucker slut to suck a dick
Motherfucker ducked, what the fuck? son of a bitch
Take away my gun, I'm gonna tuck some other shit
Can't tell me shit about the tricks of this trade
Switchblade, with a little switch to switch blades
And switch from a six to a sixteen inch blade
Shit's like a samurai sword, a sensei!
Shit just don't change to this day
I'm this way, still tell that 
ut-slay itch-bay
Uck-say my ick-day, 'scuse my ig-pay atin-lay
But uck-fay you ig-pay
 
(FIFTY!!!!)
[Hook : 50 Cent]
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't selling my soul for this rap game
And I ain't digging no hole for this rap game
Man, I'm telling you, no it ain't happening
This rap game, this rap game
I ain't selling my soul for this rap game
I ain't digging no hole for this rap game
This rap game, this rap game
[Kon Artis]
I bet you'd rather me drink and drown in my own inequity
But fuck that I'mma rap until y'all all get sick of me
And clutch my nut sack and spit all who pick at me
A pitt and rott mix, fuck the dogs you sic on me
I'm saying you motherfuckers don't know us, quit playing
If I'm broke, then I'm breaking up in the place where you laying
You know, same shit every nigga done in his life
I look at this, why speak on when I want when I write
So why should I ever fear another man
If he bleed like I bleed
, take a piss and he stand?
Okay, you win, you can say we can't rap
But no Source never made me not buy an album when they say it was whack
[Kuniva]
I walk in that party and just start 
busting
Right after I hear the last verse of "Self Destruction"
This liquor makes me wanna blast the
 
chrome
To let you know +The Time+ without Morris Day and Jerome
 (nigga)
I'm low down and shifty,
 quickly call Swifty
To do a drive-by on the tenth speed with 50
You're feeling lucky? Squeeze
I catch you outside of Chuck E. Cheese
With ya seed, you be an unlucky G
My lifestyle is unstable: a partying addict
They said no fighting in the club so I brought me a 
'matic
Coughing the static, I jump niggas, call me a 
rabbit
Popping the tablet and guns that saw you in half with
[Bridge: 50 Cent]
Believe me, we run this rap shit, fo' sheezy
Make making millions look easy
Everywhere you turn you see me, you hear me
Believe me, before 
you see my pistol in 3-D
No time to call a peace treaty
Dial 911 cause you need the- police to help you believe me
[Proof]
I snatch the chalk from the sidewalk and piss on the curb
This is absurd, these street niggas twisting my words
We finally could 
"Say Goodbye to Hollywood"
Cause Proof and Shyne man shit nothing in common
The nastiest band with gats in each hand
We never bow down to be a flash in the pan
No remorse, fuck your stature dog
Nothing to do with hands when I 
clap
 at y'all
Put your 
jaw on the ground
 with the 
four and the pound
Then I'm gone outta town 'fore the law come around
So we can battle with raps, we can battle with 
gats
Matter of fact, 
we can battle for plaques
[Bizarre]
(This rap game) I'm too fucking retarded
I don't give a fuck about my dick, that's why I'm dating 
Lorena Bobbitt
My crew had an argument, who was the largest
Now they all is dead and I roll as a solo artist
Plus I made all the beats and wrote all the raps
Well, I really didn't, but I did according to this contract
I was thrown in the snow with nowhere to go
Freezing 20 below
, 
forced to join Bel Biv Devoe
My little girl, she shouldn't listen to these lyrics
That's why I glued her headphones to her ear to make sure she hear it
If rap don't work, I'm starting a group with 
Garth Brooks
Hahahaha, 
50 sing the hook
[Hook]

[Produced by DVLP]
[Intro]
Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings
But I'm only going to get this one chance
Something's wrong, I can feel it 
(For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
Just a feeling I got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances
(You are just what the doc ordered)
[Verse 1]
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
They said I rap like a robot, so call me  rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap
Packin' a mack in the back of the Ac
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time
I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that
I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic
I was under Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow?
All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah)
[Verse 2]
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box
Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew)
MC's get taken to school with this music
Cause I use it as a vehicle to "bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac
N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run DMC
And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n
Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game,
 
'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and
Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
Little gay-lookin boy
So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy
You're witnessing a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy
Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a "way to go" from your label every day, looking boy
Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy
I get a "hell yeah" from Dre, looking boy
I'ma work for
Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit
Get outta my face, looking boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up
With the same pace, looking boy
[Verse 3]
Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
 
this planet's Krypton
 
No Asgard, Asgard
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin,
 
you rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting
And I should not be woken
I'm the walking dead
But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating
But I got your mom deep throating
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothing in common, poodle
I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me
My honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere
In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line
I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1
When I tried to say
"I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal
Coming through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking
Cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya,
 
like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singing to a man while they played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, "Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"
Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma,
 
you assuming I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber
So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
It's not hip-hop, it's pop
Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it
With rock,
 
shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice
Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?
Ungh, school flunky,
 
pill junky
But look at the accolades, these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue in cheek,
 
fuck you
I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel
I'm asleep in the front seat
Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz
Still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I had
Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation and understand the discrimination
But fuck it
Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake
If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip abroad
And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard
Be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a God?

[Verse 1]
Obie Trice, real name no gimmicks
Rap? I been in it ever since I was invented
That's cause a nigga live it
My records wield digits in history – niggas you be the witness
I got the white boys mad at me
Cause Em, signed another black boy like he nigga happy
Caucasians, Marshall knows talent
Obie Trice a riot, that's why he's hired
I hit ya raves, balloons and E's
And bang all your European Pamela Lee's
Fucking ay, or how we say it round my way
"Fo sho",
 Trice gon' blow
Then I'm off to them shows, I'm off across the globe
'til my accounts all swoll' 
for young Kobie
Big things, act like ya know me
Not a soul can hold me, I'm here
[Hook]
That's why I ain't got no,
 (rap name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(
They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!"
)
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living... 
that's why I ain't got no
, (Rap Name)
The name's (Obie Trice)
(They see me on the streets they be like "Yo he nice!")
So I came to the game ("real name, no gimmicks")
Rap my living - that's why I ain't got no
[Verse 2]
It didn't take much – one hot single
Smiles and handshakes my man
The industry greeted me with open arms
With no type of flak cause O. Trice got that
Fugaze y'all rap, who gave y'all dat
New wave of mu-zack that you're all loving?
Got your broads on my balls huggin'
Even my next-of-kin's famous (Obie's your cousin?!)
Please believe it, 
I'm as "Down to Earth" as Chris Rock
Gettin' hit by trucks, starin' at twat
A big cannon in ya G-spot
Me not arrogant girl, me keep them freaks hot
Whether or not you believe my status
I'm prepared to be the baddest on the rap that's happenin'
Put the Mitten back on the map with Mathers
 and win this
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Well I'm drunk right now, but still I got a gun
Beef? [*cocked and two shots*] best-ta run
Cuz when I pop, people's flesh get numb
And whoa.. ya might not make it to ya young
The only one with okay's wanna blaze
Meet my little friends on racks in my den
Pull 'em out, that's when the action begins
And ya block, remind you of Mad Max the film
Deserted, that's word to vacant homes
2002 Trice up in ya headphones
(If it's ya system) Trice up in ya Bose
(If it's ya women) Then Trice up in ya hoes!
I suppose that I am kinda cocky, when it's dealin
With raps, chicks, and cats out to sock me
I handle it like Rocky, Jake Steed
Rakim, Eric B.
 – 
O's a G!
[Hook]
[Outro]
Rap name ... rap name ... Obie Trice
(You can get stomped by Obie...)
 [<--- Eminem]

(Eminem Speaking)
Most people don't see how much work is really involved
In this rap shit
I didn't know it
I didn't see it
I never saw it until I was actually in it
You really gotta be in it
To understand what its like
But you always gotta
People always gotta see your smile
You always gotta put on that fake
You know what I'm sayin
No matter what you just been through
(B-Real)
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large a big house
5 cars, you're in charge
Comin up in the world
Don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
(B-Real)
I remember the days when I was a young kid growin up
Lookin in the mirror dreamin about blowin up
To rock crowds make money
Chill wit the honies
Sign autographs and whatever the people want from me
Shits funny
How impossible dreams manifest and the games that be comin with it
Never the less you gotta go for the gusto
But you don't know about the blood sweat and tears
And losin some of your peers
And losin some of your self
Through the years past gone by
Hopefully it don't manifest for the wrong guy
Egomaniac in the brainiac
Don't know how to act
Shits deep
48 tracks
Studio gangsta mack
Signs a deal, thinks he's gonna make a mil
But never will
Till he crosses
 over still
Feelin no hate
But fantasies come wit these
Shows the sacrifice it takes to make the G's
You wanna be a rap superstar in the biz?
And take shit from people who don't know what it is
I wish it was all fun and games
But the price of fame is high
And some can't pay to play
Trapped in what you rappin about
Tell me what happened when you lost clout
The route you took started collapsing
No fans
No fame
No respect
No change
No women
And everyone shits on your name
(Chorus)
So you wanna be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
You're in charge
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
To be a rap superstar
And live large
A big house
5 cars
You're in charge
Comin up in the world don't trust nobody
Gotta look over your shoulder constantly
(Noreaga Speaking)
When you sign to a record label
You don't know you sign your life over
And these whiteboys don't care about you
Cuz the minute you fall off
They'll find another Noreaga
And they'll find another Capone-n-Noreaga
And they'll find another B-Real
So you need to just keep
Stack your chips up
Do what you gotta do while your hot
And mafuckin get out the game
Stick to the drug game
And it's even worse than the the drug game
Because if someone jerks you
You can shoot em and kill me
But in this game if someone jerks you
You gotta be humble
(Eminem Speaking)
No matter what you just been through
Shit has gotta be right
You gotta approach people
You gotta be on the up and up
And everything gotta be all good
When you see someone slap hands with em
You know what I'm sayin give em a pound
Or whatever it is
But you always gotta act like it ain't shit
(Chorus)
(B-Real)
My own son don't know me
Sittin up in the hotel room lonely
But I thank God I'm wit my homies
But sometimes I wish I was back home
But only no radio or videos
Cuz they show me no love
The phony gotta hit the road slowly
So the record gets pushed by Sony
I'm in the 
middle like Monie
And the press say that
My own people disown me
And the best way back
Is to keep your head straight
Never inflate the cranium
Your crew worried about them honies at 
the Paladium
Who just wanna cling on and swing on
And so on and go on and fall off
The hoes fall off
To the next rap superstar
Wit no shame give him a year
And they'll be right out the game
The same as the last one
Who came before him
Gained fame
Started gettin ignored
I warned him
Assured him
This ain't easy take it from Weezy
Sleezy people wanna be cheesey
They talkin evil
(Chorus)

[Intro - Eminem]
WAAAAHHHHHHHOOOOOOOOOOO!!! {*laughs*}
Guess who's back?!?!
Mommy! We're home!!
Say hello to my little friends
DJ Muggs, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill
Everybody! Put your hands where my eyes can see!!!
[Verse - Eminem]
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was
50, Tweezy, Obie
 
there won't be no ho in us
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it
The noise from clips and rounds be drowned out by the crowd
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing
Till the club closes, and clears out Land that's when they see you flatened
Nobody saw it happen, 
all cause your jaws are flapping
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off
[Hook - Eminem]
Shit's about to change, cause we ain't playing no games
We ain't budging neither are they, we ain't saying no names
Shit just ain't the same, when the K's get to scream
Hip-hop is in a state of 911
It ain't about hip-hop, cause those days are gone
It ain't about trying rip shots, to get props no more
It's about trying not to get popped, and get dropped to the floor
Cause hip-hop is in a state of 911
[Verse - B-Real]
Step off my holster cause shit it's getting serious
All theses drugs you be fucking with make you delirious
Thinking you coming with heat, yo son, I'm curious
How long are you gunna hate us and judge us and jury us?
Some people can never fade us, that make us so furious
Mistake us for fakers, homie we greater and glorious
We living for real and others just making the stories up
Allusions are broken, so live it up, you corny fucks
If you take a fucking minute to think about what you've done
When you stood against a gangsta who live and die by the gun
Got a hot one, spraying you bitches til there is none
I'm like a rolling stone homie, I got you under my thumb
Silly little bitches can end up right up in ditches
We cut you and give you stitches, for envy and all my riches
Your game's just like a midget, you're clocking a small digit
Dealing with the Giant Goliath, people that's how we live it
, c'mon
[Hook]
[Verse - Ganxsta Ridd]
Uh, gangsta Ganxsta who come to pay you a visit
On this shit you call hip-hop, this function is where did it
When I - put it in motion, my focus is getting branded
My appetite for destruction is blasted because I said it
Got you - stumbling for cover, this music dying in numbers
But you wouldn't pause and wonder, admitting it's all glamour
When you - enter the business you thinking you running shit
You witness that funny shit, your bitches they ain't shit!
We gangstas we blast first, ask questions later
All these - imitators parading like they some playas
Trying to - save hip-hop the task is something greater
Cause we old fashioned coded with loyalty motivaters
Get caught, I'm not telling, or more like killing not caring
I'm riding - a gangsta feeling, no fearing when gangstas dying
I'm in a - full circle with homies that's supposed to bleed
On an 8 Mile mission with Cypress and O.G.'s
[Hook]

[Hook: RBX]
Remember me? Seven executions
Remember me? I have no remorse
Remember me? I'm high powered
Remember me? I drop bombs like Hiroshima
[Verse 1: RBX]
For this one it's the X, you retarded
Cause I grab the mic and get Down like Syndrome
Hide and roam into the masses
Without boundaries,
 
which qualifies me
For the term universal, without no rehearsal
I leak words that's controversial
Like I'm not the one you wanna contest, see
Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
That got banned from TV,
 
heavyweight hitter
Hit you watch your whole head split up
Loco is the motion, we comin' through
Hollow tips is the lead, the forty-five threw
[Hook: Sticky Fingaz]
Remember me? Throw ya gunz in the air
Remember me? Slam, Slam
Remember me? Nigga, bacdafucup
Remember me? Chka-chka-Onyx
[Verse 2: Sticky Fingaz]
Niggas that take no for an answer, get told no
Yeah, I been told no, but it was more like no, no, no
Life's a bitch, met her, fuck you if you let her
Better come better than better to be a competitor
This vet is ahead of the shit is all redder, you deader and deader
A medic instead of the cheddars and credda
Settle vendetta with metal beretta from ghetto to ghetto
Evidence, nope, never leave a shred-of
I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me or hate me
My mom's got raped by the industry and made me
I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
I get more pussy than them dyke bitches Total
Want beef, nigga? Pbbt, you better dead that shit
My name should be Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-Shit
Probably sayin' he ain't a killer, but I'm killin' myself
Smoke death, fuck bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
So think what I'mma do to you, have done to you
Got niggas in my hood who'd do that shit for a blunt or two
What you wanna do, 
cocksuckers, we Glock busters
'til the cops cuff us, we'll start ruckus and drop blockbusters
Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
I'm getting wires niggas wanting me dead, wanting my head
You think it could be something I said ?
[Hook: Eminem]
Remember me? I just don't give a fuck
Remember me? Yeah, fuck you too
Remember me? I'm low down and I'm shifty
Remember me? I'm Shady
[Verse 3: Eminem]
When I go out, I'mma go out shooting
I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image so I promised the fuckin' critics
I wouldn't say fuckin' for six minutes
 
(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blonde
So I made me a song, killed her and put Hailie on
I may be wrong, I keep thinking these crazy thoughts
In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
(Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on)
Came home, and somebody musta broke in the back window
And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trenchcoats
Sick, sick dreams of picnic scenes
Two kids, sixteen with M-16's and ten clips each
And them shits reach through six kids each
And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clint's speech to fix these streets
Fuck that, pbbt – you faggots can vanish to volcanic ash
And reappear in hell with a can of gas and a match
Aftermath,
 
Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
(What the fuck you staring at, nigga?)
[Outro]
Don't you remember me? Remember me?
Remember me? Remember me? (Slim Shady!)

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
That same dude you gave nothing, I made something doing
What I do, through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point-of-view
The renegade, you been afraid
I penetrate pop culture, bring em a lot closer to the block where they
Pop toasters
 
and they live with they Moms
Got dropped roadsters from botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked
No he's not around
Now how that sound to ya, jot it down
I bring it through the ghetto without riding round
Hiding down ducking strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothing relate to it
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you're worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with em a minute
Cause, see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits I'll wear it
But if it don't,
 
then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Using his music to steer it, sharing his views and his merits
But there's a huge interference: they're saying you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment, nah nah
That's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothing to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fucking do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here
I don't think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go, he's 
{*Jigga j-Jigga*}
And I'm the sinister Mr. Kiss-My-Ass,
 
it's just the
[Hook: Eminem and Jay Z]
Renegade, never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade! Never been afraid to talk
About anything, anything, anything, anything, renegade
Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade,
 never been afraid to 
holler
About anything (etc.)
[Verse 3: Jay Z]
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent
Gotta vent, lot of innocent lives lost on the project bench
Whatchu hollering, gotta pay rent, bring dollars in
By the bodega,
 
iron under my coat, feeling braver
Durag wrapping my waves up, pockets full of hope
Do not step to me, I'm awkward, I box lefty
An orphan my pops left me,
 
and often, my momma wasn't home
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown,
 
especially on nights
I brought something home to quiet the stomach rumblings
My demeanor, thirty years my senior
My childhood didn't mean much, only raising green up
Raising my fingers to critics
Raising my head to the sky B.I.G. I did it, multi before I die
No lie, just know I chose my own fate
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight
[Verse 4: Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern-day Shakespeare
Jesus Christ, the King of these Latter-Day Saints here
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me as
As a monger of hate, satanist, scatter-brained atheist
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is
Or is he the latter, a gateway to escape
Media scapegoat; who they can be mad at today
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistling Dixie
While I'm waving the pistol at sixty Christians against me
Go to war with the Mormons,
 
take a bath with the Catholics
In holy water, no wonder they tried to hold me under longer
I'm a motherfucking spiteful, delightful eyeful
The new Ice Cube, motherfuckers hate to like you
What did I do,
 
I'm just a kid from the gutter
Making this butter off these bloodsuckers
Cause I'm a muthafuckin'
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Royce]
It's several different levels to picking up shovels and dumping you
In ditches under sea level
 front and you can witness
Let me refreshing you niggas tell you my position in this
Beef! Leave you under Venice, opposition finished
There it is, 
we invaded created a Pyramid
Of a Haven of names, so blame Dre, and that ear of his
So.. breathe, I'd rather reach for your neck
And I never heat you for respect, unless you greet me with less
I've got a skunk in my trunk, I'm lying
I've got a pump in my trunk,
 you're dying, 
how many lumps niggas want?
Who's ready for y'all? We ready for y'all
We too incredibly raw, for any artist that said he would draw
I stand firm, and it hurts to live it
You open that can of worms, I hope you ready for the dirt that's with it
Slap a ho, snatch a mic,
 
being brought to y'all in black and in white
(It's the new)
 
Joe Jackson and Ike, we renegades
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
Cause see they call me a menace, and if the shoe fits I'll wear it

You fucking do-gooders too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (HAHA)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't
Think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo
Cause here we go, he's
 
Royce, he's the King Of Detroit
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass is just a
[Hook]
Renegade!
 
Never been afraid to say
What's on my mind at, any given time of day
Cause I'm a renegade! 
Never been afraid to talk
About anything (anything) anything (anything)
[Verse 3: Royce]
I determine what time it's on, 
I call my nigga Proof
Hand him a pint of Limon and turn him loose
I'm tired of you new jacks, 
I'm tired of niggas that's like (I'm 'bout to blow)
Unless you a bitch, we don't care if you bout do that
Move back, youngster, the Glock on speak
Chew up your vest and turn your chest hair to taco meat
The street, continuous to pit, quick to smash ya
Or flash the clip, or give you the picture develop the
Click clock, six shots blows through another door
And it gets hot, Hip-hop Quotable tug of war
Who did ya niggas beats you bitches, who made it work?
That shit was.. I got harder two-way alerts
Just when I thought my dog couldn't get any meaner
You talk about his daughter, you probably getting the nina
You talk about his momma, he won't even give ya the finger
(He's crazy) Deranged, not media eaters, we renegades
[Verse 4: Eminem]
See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare

[Hook]

[Eminem]
I wasn't born mean I was pushed to trechary
I walked the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I like a veggie brain, turn to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't give me Kim things could get messy
So pass that ass to me, let me squish the left cheek
And pressed against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods the mc
With the Christopher Reeves beef, we started off on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg, made outta wood? I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood, I'm chilling with Westwood
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow, I like jello, I'm like hello
To a cute little dyke on the mic, I'm kinda like...
Iron Mike cos I bite earlobes
[Mr.Porter]
Well, I must must say well uh
I'm just not gay well I
I'm must must say um well
See I'm the first to class and the last to leave
I mean I'm the first one to leave out of class, believe
That I'm a mailbox pimp in my heart til' I die
Even after I'm all gone and my ashes fry
Went from ashy guy, class clown this high
To a grown ass man
Runyons ave's the click, 
D12's the gang
We been spitting; this shit since we was little baby's
Gaga googoo nana, nanny booboo? never
Word to my homie Em, I'm just too too clever
A 45 shot'll leave a motherfuckers face lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think I'm cock eyed-ed
When I bust it off in the crow, you start diving
Greg Louganis in over the bar, I ain't lyin'
Hot I ain't equal, it's not defying a soldier
Runyons Ave soldier equals death when it's over
There's nothing colder than niggas than understranded struggle
Fly the street muscle, We been had the hussle
We been had the hussle, We been had the hussle
Fly the street muscle, We been had the hussle
[Eminem]
Me and Westwood blasting off
Jacking off in a pair of Acid Wash,
 bumping Asher Roth
Crusin Gratiot till I damn near﻿ crash the car
Tryna smash a moth on the dash, hit the overpass-went off
Over the bridge, into on coming traffic
Caused a massive 42 car pile up, not a scratch at all
Hocked up holding a axe and saw
Jason mask is off but my face is plastered in Tabasco sauce
Spitting flames, kicking fire out ya ass
Ya little bastard, you can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdraw
Dick's so big it's like estlastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of plastic man, with a drastic force and went spastic
Put my penis on Classic Sports
[Mr. Porter]

[Intro]
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don't have one
[Verse 1]
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
And had me on the back of a motorcycle,
 
then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco,
 
it's like handing a psycho a loaded handgun
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, "In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan"
A Jedi in training, colossal brain and, thoughts are entertainin'
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker,
 
but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh it's on the ram-page,
 
couldn't see what I wrote I write small
It says, "Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewall,
 
had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire
 
to Die Hard"
So as long as I'm on the clock punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch
[Hook]
Now sometimes, when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
Is she taken? Is she mine?
Don't got time, don't care, don't have two shits to give
Let me take you by the hand to promised land
And threaten everyone
Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
[Bridge]
Now
(What's your name?) Marshall
(Who's your daddy?) I don’t know him, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)
[Verse 2]
No, if he had
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad
Yeah Dad
I'm the epitome and the prime
Example of what happens when the power of the rhyme
Falls into the wrong hands, and
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
Who just happens, to be rapping,
 
blue lights flashing
Laughing all the way to the bank, lamping in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, ripping the aisle apart but
With great power comes absolutely no responsibility
 
for content
Completely, despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy
 
is on a beat killing spree
Your honor, I must plead guilty, cause I sparked a revolution
Rebel without a cause
 
who caused the evolution
Of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it
("Hip-hop is the devil's music") Does that mean it belongs to me?
Cause I just happen to be, a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But, lyrically, I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch,
 cause it's the...
[Hook]
It's the time of the season, when hate runs high
And this time, I won't give it to you easy
When I take back what's mine with pleasured hands
And torture everyone, that is my plan
My job here isn't done
Cause there's no rhyme or no reason for nothing
[Bridge]
(What's your name?) Shady
(Who's your daddy?) I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder
(Is he rich like me?) Doubt it, ha
(Has he taken, any time, to show you what you need to live?)
[Verse 3]
So yeah, Dad, let's walk
Let's have us a father and son talk
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off,
 
this is all your fault
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas, I a-ppealed
 
to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
Cause I, related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
Now they're ripping out their fucking hair again, it's hysterical
I chuckle, as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
Yeah uh-oh, better beware knuckle heads
The sign of my hustle says "Don't knock, the doors broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite, zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy getting stoned in your glass house, to kick rocks
Then you wonder why I lash out
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers,
 
so spread the word
Cause I'm promoting my passion until I'm passed out
Completely brain dead, Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer put together with Chief Keef
Cause I hate every fucking thing, yeah
Even this rhyme, bitch
And quit trying look for a fucking reason for it that ain't there
But I still am a "Criminal!"
Ten-year-old degenerate grabbing on my genitals!
The last Mathers LP done went diamond
This time I'm predicting this one will go emerald!
When will the madness end, how can it when
There's no method to the pad and pen
The only message that I have to send is, Dad
I'm back at it again
Yeah... (Who's your daddy?)

Alright, look
Any rapper say you know this kind of rhymes
And this day and age, in this period of time
Trying to battle Eminem is worse than David Star(?)
Trying to battle 
Proof
, 
IQ
, Beef and 
Bizarre
That's why you like the ?
You ain't got no style plus you lack delivery
Not to beg, I don't mean to boast
Look, my face is pale, but you look like you seen a ghost
?
?
You're that bitch, you couldn't slip into the zone
If I put banana peels around this fucking microphone
Go get a bull dozer, start from bottom to top
And tear this building down cause that's the only way you're wrecking shop

Are you feeling good about the album at this point?
Um, that's a tough question, man. For the most part, yeah. But I don't know if I ever feel totally great about a record when I put it out. With every record that I put out, someone has literally got to come pry it from me because when I listen to my own music, I just hear flaws in it. Like I hear 'Oh fuck! I could have done this better or that better!' And I'll work it to death. Obviously if I wasn't comfortable with it, I wouldn't put it out. But from the beginning, ever since my career started, I don't know if I've ever been totally like, this is completely it.
In this last crunch, what have you been working on?
I guess you would say last minute jitters of "Fuck! Are the vocals loud enough? Can you hear what I'm saying on this part? Is the beat right? Are the vocals too loud?'" If I could not have to mix any songs and just take the actual two tracks that I rapped over and put them out, I would do that. 'Cause nothing ever feels the way as when you first did it.
But you're not changing lyrics or anything like that? It's just all mix and sound stuff? It's just sonic shit that needs to be worked out for the most part, because when I decide to keep a song, that's pretty much it. Like, if it doesn't work, I pretty much know right away, right when I get it in the car and take it home.
Rolling Stone's Review of Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP 2
So why did you dye your hair blonde again?
Um, I'll say that one was [manager Paul Rosenberg's] idea. In the earlier stages of the record and developing this shit I had thought about it. And once the songs started to come together and the picture got a little more clear of what it was gonna be, he hit me with the idea and I was like "Yo, you know I thought about that, right?" And he was like, "Well you know, why not?" And I was like "I don't know how it's gonna look. I haven't had it in how many fucking years? Five, six years." I was like, "I'm so used to it being dark," you know. So I just tried it. And I was like "Fuck it."
Did physically looking like that help you get back in the mindset or change the way you were recording?
Not really, honestly. Because I already had most of the songs. And I don't know if I'm gonna keep it like this or how long I'm gonna keep it. But for right now it is what it is. And I feel like it may fit and maybe people will understand when they get the record.
For Recovery there was a lot of rejected stuff. You recorded 100 songs or something, or at least you had 100 beats. So was there a lot of stuff thrown in the garbage pile this time around?
I feel like right now I'm probably working harder than I've ever worked in my life. And I've probably worked harder on this record than any other record aside from maybe 
the time period during The Eminem Show, which is a little hazy 'cause just so much shit was going on at that time.
 Just being so busy with The Eminem Show and doing the 8 Mile movie, and the soundtrack and the score to the movie. This is probably the equivalent of that but all focused on the record mostly.
That's crazy.
Once I had the direction that I wanted to go, and you know calling it The Marshall Mathers LP 2, obviously I knew that there might be certain expectations. Like, I wouldn't want to just call it that just for the sake of calling it that. So I wanted to make sure that I had the right songs to be able to call it that. So, a lot of recording. A lot of songs that people probably will never hear. We hit a couple of road blocks. There were songs where the beat leaked or a producer sold the beat to someone else or whatever. And just when you think you got it or you got the right amount of songs you go back and you listen and you're like, "Fuck man! I feel like it needs this or this" to paint the whole picture.
A lot of people, maybe even you, think the original is your best album.
It's probably my favorite. I think some of them are my favorites for different reasons. Hate to even say that about my own record, but I mean the first three records, I think they may have captured a time period. And then I think I pretty much probably have publicly said, you know, Encore and Relapse wasn't – it was just a different time.
You've been hard on Relapse, but Tyler, the Creator says that it's his favorite hip-hop record in years. He loves that record.
Yeah, he tells me that every time I see him. I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, but at the same time find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like "Ha ha this is funny!" You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but it just was like "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the ground. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.
On Recovery, obviously the world came to you on that one. How do you feel now about that record?
I feel like that record I finally got back to where I was at maybe during The Eminem Show. Like, creatively and songwriting, I guess. I mean obviously Recovery was the first time I had ever worked with that many producers outside of our camp. Aside from working with Dre, it was like I always wanted to produce my own records, because producing is fun to me too. One of the things that was cool for me about that record was getting beats that already had choruses on them. It's kind of like a challenge to myself to be able to hear somebody else's hook and kind of interpret the words. Because my own hooks, I already know what I mean when I write them. The way that I do music is, like, regardless of what the beat is and whatever kind of appeal it may or may not have, I always want to try to go as hard lyrically as I can. So regardless if the beat feels like "Wow maybe this could be played on the radio," I'm not like, "Maybe radio would play this so I'll just wing it." Like, I always have looked at it like I want to approach every record from an MCs' aspect.
So how did you come to decide to designate this the sequel to The Marshall Mathers LP? How did you decide to make your life miserable like that?
Well here's what it is: 
It's not necessarily a sequel.
Okay.
As much as it is a revisitation – like this is a different time period in my life. So there's not gonna be like, continuations of every song or anything like that. To me, it's more about the vibe and the nostalgia. One of my favorite new things to do is experiment with new, older breakbeats and sounds and shit like that. You know, retro shit, and try to make it current, like bring it up to date.
So did seeking out Rick Rubin come from that direction? You were like "Why don't I go back to the source?"
Paul had mentioned to me that he might be interested in doing it and he had been talking to him and I was like, "Fuck man." Another thing with this record is that I kind of got back into producing more. On Recovery, I wanted to focus more on writing, and not have to worry abut making the beats. On Relapse I think it was mostly all Dre. So I kind of started producing again a little bit. I was kind of in the middle of that when Paul had mentioned that, and was fucking around with those kind of sounds and I don't know if that's what made Paul reach out to Rick or if Rick reached out to him. But as soon as I heard he was interested I was like, "Yo, just let me finish this up and let's go see him."
You've called Rick "Yoda" – was there still stuff to be learned from him at this point in your career?
[Yoda voice] 
Learning I did.
 Um, yeah, I mean the best part about Rick's vibe is he's very Zen-like in the sense of just "Let it happen." The weird thing about it is nine times out 10, we would know instantly if something didn't work and it didn't feel right, you know. He's almost like a coach.[Obie Trice]
Yeah, Trice
The Statik Selektah
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
O back around the corner, got the crack
Put in your orders, we 'bout to run up out the storages
It's notorious, the way I got big spitting stories
BME's X-Clan, vanglorious
We're not your favorite, fuck it, you know the system
And you buck it, have you revisiting how you used to love it
My niggas spew through the music, acoustics
School kid used to pursue excuses
Truth is, I was truant in school
So its influence is foolish, that was my views
I’m back at it, the rap addict,
 
by any means
We gonna get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans
Say he ain't a star, niggas might be right
I'm so regular, nigga gotta shit tonight
Take it back Selektah, let 'em know it's Trice
Put your seatbelts on, we gon' ride tonight
[Verse 2: Eminem]
And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise!
 
Hi, it's Ike
'bout to get my Ike on,
 
I come with a life supply of wife beaters
And my Nikes on
 
and a white tee over that iron mic
Lookin' fly tonight,
 
feel like I might die from
 
a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream
With the pliers, like "Ahh!"
 
only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to
 
Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home,
 
pick up two Big Bufords
Scrupulous,
 
girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested
To impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman
And get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement
If you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a ho cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me
 
in senseless mind babble
"What me? Apologize?"
 
That's just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled!
[Hook: Eminem]
Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your
 
fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates it's your first clue, Sherlock, prick!
Just call me Richard
[Verse 3: Obie Trice]
That's my motives, jumpin' off in Rovers
All white, like I was right up in the Dakotas
Or Minnesota,
 
did I mention soda?
When it's mixed with the yola, watch my cup runneth over
Cut from a soldier, them ho niggas disposable toaster
Putting holes in a nigga getting close enough
BME 'til the credits roll
'til my condition is beyond what the medics know
They wanna edit O, like a prosthetic third
Leg let it go,
 
this is Shady 1.0, Em let 'em know
I still profit through the process
The prize in my jeans my balls'll never digress
I'm a dick that I brag about
I put it in faster than I drag it out
World, I be your special friend see
Cause these suckas suffer from pseudo-penis envy...
 So!
[Hook]

[Eminem]
Once you call my name out things will never be the same
They should have never let us get our foot in this game
Ever since I was introduced to rap music
I been missing a screw like Bishop in "Juice," I could lose it
At any moment, those who know me know it
So they probably told to go with the flow, just so that
I don't explode and, have another episode
Where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did
I'm waiting for that next beef, I'm cocked locked and loaded
I'm ready to go so bad
I'm going bananas,
 
my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could
Use it to fucking pole-vault with
Oh shit! I mean when she was still bloated
Before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name
It's a game, cause they know that they don't spit the same
It's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame
Everyday it's the same thing
People in this game try to buddy-buddy us
Just to get close enough to study us
Everybody just wants to have something to do with that
They all trying get that stamp
They after that Shady/Aftermath money
It's like a monopoly
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully
50 Cent was like a fucking jackpot for me
And Dre, it's like we hit the fucking lottery
And the damn slot machine at the same time as each other
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered
That we had more in common that we thought with each other
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?
Cause we started thinking God doesn't love us
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time
What a coincidence it is
, 
cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica
Queens
, 
I still remember the call up at Chung King cause
Big L had just got popped just a month before
If 50 lives he's getting dropped from
 
Columbia
Two years later me and
 
Doc
 
had to come and uhh
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wondering
Even if I'm under the gun
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye
There'll always be animosity between you and I
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit
Still gonna conduct motherfucking business as usual
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call
Nikes
, 
Earthlings
, how do you like these?
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats
Stomping, I been romping
Since Tim Dog was, hollering, "Fuck Compton"
I was whiling, freestyling
Back when, they were still making, Maxell casettes
I wasn't even rap's Elvis yet, that tells us that
Any doubts in your head that seals the shit
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc
And ya don't stop

[Intro]
Aw man...
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
And peeople that you don't even know jump in?
[Verse 1: Eminem]
You feel like you wanna hit something, your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
From splitting your shit wide open,
 
no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
You end up going out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors, scissors and blades make Jason say "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kicking debate
That's starting to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium
Whisked away in an ambulance is your fate
Nothing nobody told you when you left the house today
Could of made you anticipate Such an ass-whipping, okay
'til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face,
 reciprocate, come on
[Hook]
So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my
 nuts?
My balls are feeling a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my britches
[Verse 2]
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mace cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin' rowdy you feel, now you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell nah
He must be trying to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like 2 seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expecting that
Cause they want in on the act, 
there's a cognac bottle
We snuck it in cause the beer that they was serving here was only tap
I'm biting, I fight dirty, you might get kicked in the nuts
You're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certain he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
Dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
We settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
It's sheer hustle, 
I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tussling, the crowd's starting to cheer us and
Adrenaline's rushing through us just like a geyser gushing
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm strangling your windpipe for nothing
My signature ligature marks,
 look at you all
Big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
And dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick it's Bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
As having me wanna rip out your fricking ligaments, ahh
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails for that
You catch an open hand slap like a female like bap
In fact I'll have the crowd smacking you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doing this by myself, come on
[Hook]

[Intro]
Ayo, this song is dedicated to all the happy people
All the happy people who have real nice lives
And have no idea what it's like to be broke as fuck
[Verse 1]
I feel like I'm walkin' a tight rope without a circus net
Poppin' Percocet, I'm a nervous wreck
I deserve respect but I work a sweat for this worthless check
I'm about to burst this Tec at somebody to reverse this debt
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged
Full of venom and rage, especially when I'm engaged
And my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper
I pray that God answers; maybe I'll ask nicer
Watchin' ballers while they're flossin' in their Pathfinders
These overnight stars becomin' autograph-signers
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us
Along with the small fries and average half-pinters
But player-haters turnin' bitch like they have vaginas
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us
Money'll brainwash you and leave your ass mindless
When snakes slither in the grass spineless
[Hook]
That's rock bottom - when this life makes you mad enough to kill
That's rock bottom - when you want something bad enough to steal
That's rock bottom - when you feel like you've had it up to here
Cause you mad enough to scream but you're sad enough to tear
[Verse 2]
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams
I'm hopin' things look up; but there ain't no job openings
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished
Livin' in this house with no furnace, unfurnished
And I'm sick of workin' dead-end jobs with lame pay
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day
But fuck it: if you know the rules to the game, play
Cause when we die we know we all goin' the same way
Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan
I'm comfortable and roomy in a 6
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics
Who walk around depressed and smoke a pound of cess a day
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play
Live half a life and throw the rest away
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
There's people that love me and people that hate me
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbin', deceitful and shady
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame
If it means I end up burnin' in hell, scorchin' in flames
If it means I'm stealin' your checkbook and forgin' your name
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain
Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom
I've got problems - now everybody on my block's got em
I'm screaming like them two cops when 2Pac shot em
Holding two Glocks
; 
hope your doors got new locks on em
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on em
And them rings you wearin' look like they got a few rocks on em
And while you flaunt em I could be takin' em to shops to pawn em
I got a couple of rings and a brand-new watch; you want em?
Cause I ain't never went gold off one song
I'm runnin' up on someone's lawn with guns drawn
[Hook]

[Intro]
Okay, I'm going to attempt to drown myself
You can try this at home
You can be just like me
Mic check one two
We recording?
[Verse 1]
I'm cancerous
So when I diss you wouldn't want to answer this
If you responded back with a battle rap you wrote for Canibus
I strangle you to death then I choke you again
And break your fucking legs til your bones poke through your skin
You beef with me I'mma even the score equally
Take you on Jerry Springer and beat your ass legally
I get too blunted off of funny home grown
Cause when I smoke out I hit the trees harder than Sonny Bono (oh no!)
So if I said I never did drugs
That would mean I lie
 
and get fucked more than the President does
Hilary Clinton tried to slap me and call me a pervert
I ripped her fucking tonsils out and fed her sherbet (bitch!)
My nerves hurt and lately I'm on edge
Grabbed Vanilla Ice and ripped out his blond dreads (come here)
Every girl I ever went out with has gone lez
Follow me and do exactly what the song says
Smoke weed, take pills, drop out of school, kill people and drink
Jump behind the wheel like it was still legal
I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal
So I'm dumb enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill
Some people only see that I'm white, ignoring skill
Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill
But I don't get pissed
Y'all don't even see through the mist
How the fuck can I be white?
I don't even exist
I get a clean shave, bathe, go to a rave
Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave?
And this is how I'm supposed to teach kids how to behave?
[Hook 1]
Now follow me and do exactly what you see
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I slap women and eat 'shrooms then O.D
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
[Verse 2]
Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole
When we heard a knock at the door, must have been Ron Gold
Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold
Killed them both and smeared blood in a white Bronco (we did it)
My mind won't work if my spine don't jerk
I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
I'm not a player just a ill rhyme sayer
That'll spray a Aerosol can up at the ozone layer
My rap style's warped
I'm running out the morgue
With your dead grandmother's corpse
To throw it on your porch
Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon with a cape on
And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn
I'm about as normal as Norman Bates
With deformative traits
A premature birth that was four minutes late
Mother, are you there?
I love you
I never meant to hit you over the head with that shovel
Will someone please explain to my brain
That I just severed a main vein
With a chainsaw and I'm in pain
I take a breather and sigh
Either I'm high or I'm nuts
Cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am I
So when you see your mom with a thermometer shoved in her ass
Then it probably is obvious I got it on with her
Cause when I drop this solo shit it's over with
I bought Cage's tape, opened it and dubbed over it
[Hook 2]
I came to the club drunk with a fake ID
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I've been with ten women who got HIV
Now don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I got genital warts and it burns when I pee
Don't you want to grow up to be just like me?
I tie a rope around my penis and jump from a tree
You probably want to grow up to be just like me


He's very psychological, right?
Yeah the guy's got his shoes off. [Laughs] Working with him is the most relaxed atmosphere. He's not afraid to try anything. I kind of felt in the same way I felt, and still feel to this day, as far as like wanting to impress Dre. We talked at his house and then I think we went straight to his studio from there and we started going through breakbeats. I told him that I had started experimenting with some more retro sounds. So we just sat down and started picking shit out and I would start writing to them and next time I'd get together with him we'd start adding shit to it. The dude's got so many ideas, man. One of the coolest things about the sound that he gives you is the Rick Rubin scratches. When he fucking scratches some shit, it's almost like this perfect slop that it has on it. Not that it's off-time or anything like that, but it's just like – it's fucking weird. I don't even know how to explain it. You just know that he scratched it. I don't know if that even makes sense or not. It's like a simple scratch, like a basic kind of thing, but it's so fucking dope when you hear it. It's just, it's vintage him. And plus he knows what a lot of those sounds came from and shit.
Did he have all the old drum machines sitting around the studio?
Oh, he's got some shit in the stash. Yeah. Definitely.
So much has changed in hip-hop since you started producing – did you find the beats you were making on your own were influenced by newer stuff?
Um, not necessarily, because like I feel like I just do whatever feels right. Obviously I pay attention to what's going on and what's out and keep my finger on that pulse. But I don't ever want to be like or do like what anyone else is doing. That's no offense to anyone else.
Basically, if there are outside influences that are current, you let that come in from the other producers, but your shit is your shit.
Yeah. That's exactly it. More current-sounding shit I leave to them. And not that I don't feel like my shit sounds current, but it's not the exact same thing. And I think I've updated as well.
On the new song "Legacy" you're talking about yourself in detail as a kid. What does it take to get back in that mindset at your age?
I always try to make my music relatable to the kid who people said, "He ain't shit" or bullied or whatever. It felt like one of them self-empowerment songs. Everybody, I believe, wants to show the world that, "One day I'm gonna be this. One day I'm gonna be that." Everybody has goals, aspirations or whatever, and everybody has been at a point in their life where nobody believed in them. Like, if you haven't been kicked or whatever, if you never went through. . .
Tribulations.
Tribulations and shit like that, then you're perfect and fuck you anyways. So everybody has been in that place where they just have been counted out or not even counted. Like, "You don't matter." "Oh yeah? I'm gonna show you." So it was about incorporating that idea into the idea of my legacy – into what I leave behind when I'm gone. And I always looked up to other rappers for the words that they gave me. There's many, many songs that got me through a lot of shit.
I just love that you rhyme "Onyx" with "comics" on that song.
I don't know if anyone will get this, like this is super-nerdy, but the rhyming words in that song never change. And that's just one of the things that I do to try to challenge myself. I wanted to try to make a whole song where the rhyming words never changed.
You've praised the Beastie Boys' evolution, but it doesn't seem like you're going to have a "
the disrespect for women has got to be through" moment.
I mean, listen, my sense of humor has certainly not gone away. I realize that I'm an adult, a grown-ass man, and I don't know what I'll be doing a year from now, 10 years from now, but I don't think that my tongue-in-cheekness will ever go away. I guess it's just a part of my personality. I always want to keep some type of element of fun to the music as well. If one song is darker or talking about a sad subject, I don't want to make a whole album of that, of being a downer. I don't want to make a whole album of being too uppity. You gotta try and find that right balance, and that's one of the things that the creative process was on this record as far as just experimenting. In other words, recording till I get it. And if I record 100 fucking songs and I don't have what I feel like I need yet to make the body of work, then I'm gonna keep going and keep recording.
You've written a bunch of your own hooks, and even sing some of them. Where does your sense of melody come from?
That's a good question. I would want to say that it's stemming from early hip-hop. Rappers used to fuck around all the time with melodies, at least on the shit that I grew up on. I don't know keys on a keyboard or what note this is or that is. I can only hum something. But I think it just comes from all the data that I've collected in my years of listening to music. And you know, fuck man, I think that as hip-hop started evolving, there was more melody in it, people were starting to sing hooks. Even like, early Slick Rick – [sings] "Hey young world" – those kind of things. Maybe I took it somewhere different at times, I don't know.
Maybe it's just pure instinct.
Honestly, that's probably what it is. I don't want that to sound like arrogant or nothing but I just don't know where I get that sense from, you know what I'm saying? I'm not a singer singer. I just know what's in key and what's not.
Having Kendrick Lamar on your album, did you have any concern that he might go in and try to upstage you?
I completely respect what Kendrick does and the fact that he's in the same camp, that he's on Aftermath, only made sense to me. He came to Detroit, we kicked it for a few minutes, you know, and I felt the vibe of what he's like and everything, and you know, he's a super cool and super humble dude. When we did that record, I think that was actually a week or two before he did the verse to "Control."
Is there advice you would give him at this point?
I don't know if he needs advice. He seems like he's got a really good head on his shoulders, man. He's very smart and you can tell by the way he put his album together for one. He's like a hip-hop head, man, he just loves hip-hop. And obviously the way that he did the "Control" verse, it was almost like if you get mad at him, then you might look foolish. He set it up so that you can't really get mad at a lot of that shit he said because it was what every other MC is already thinking. Or you should be thinking.
Fundamentally, do you feel like a rap god or do you feel like an underdog?
I think everything switches back and forth from hour to hour, day by day with me. That whole "Rap God" record pretty much from top to bottom is tongue in cheek. So I mean, do I want to feel like that? Maybe sometimes. Again, it goes back to everybody who competitive raps and does this for just purely the sport of it wants to be the best. Again, that's why Kendrick's verse worked so well because he only said what every rapper's already thinking, If you don't want to be the best, then why are you rapping?

I put my orange
4 Inch
Door hinge in storage
And ate porridge
With George

[Intro - Hit-Boy]
Bring the H, to the B
Then you'll get, all of me
[Bridge - Jessica Hayley (with Skippa)]
When everybody listens, I say (Roll Up!)
When everybody's shouting, I say (Roll Up!)
And when they hear me sing, I say (Roll Up!)
When we in the club, I go say (Roll Up!)
[Hook - Skippa (with Jessica Hayley)]
They all hear me come
(I roll up my sleeve)
I get to the champagne
(I pour it all in)
(You don't know anyone)
(Until you know me)
[Verse 1 - DJ M.K.A]
You hearing me, I'm coming in
It's M.K. little s**t
And when you begin smoking
I'll begin to show grit
I'm the one who's violent
I'll make you shoot crap
You better not kill me
Cause I can sing and rap
I'll make you pass
I'll make you grasp
I'll mug you, make you pass out
I got what it takes
To make you scream and shout
[Verse 2 - Fumin]
With what I'm on
I'll make you learn this song
You'll shout it to your friend
And wait 'till the day ends
I get strong, you go weak
What you gonna do, lil freak?
I went rolling in the deep
When you were fast asleep
And when you get tired, you'll understand my nature
Yeeeeeaaaaahhh, I'm nice but still gotta think twice
[Bridge]
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Eminem]
I'm the god of rap
And you're a peice of crap
I got flames to lit
And your a peice of s**t
I'll take your life
And take your wife
And shove it up you asshole
I'll f**k the b**ch
And push the switch
And shove it til you go slow
I'll rhyme it up
And rhyme it down
Go faster than the speed of sound
The mosh pit is cold, but I think I'm sold
[Verse 4 - K.K.Yo]
Skibbadoobadabbadabbabibblebibblebam
I am such a king and you are such a damn
I'll give the middle finger, to all you little f**ks

[Bridge]
[Hook]
[Outro - Hit-Boy]
Can you hear me?
This is the number one DJ of Planet Earth
I'm gonna hit you boy

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
I am not Jasmine, I am Aladdin
So far ahead, these bums is lagging
See me in that new thing, bums is gagging
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
I'm starting to feel like a dungeon dragon
Look at my show footage, how these girls be spazzin'
So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been?
Yeah, I said it, has-been, hang it up, flatscreen
Plasma
, 
"Hey Nicki, hey Nicki,"
 
asthma
I got the pumps, it ain't got medicine
I got bars, sentencing
I'm a bad bitch, I'm a cunt
And I'll kick that ho, punt
Forced trauma, blunt
You play the back, bitch, I'm in the front
You need a job, this ain't cutting it
Nicki Minaj is who you ain't fucking with
You lil' Fraggle Rock,
 
I beat you with a pad-a-lock
I am a movie, camera block
You outta work, I know it's tough
But enough is enough
[Hook: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Raah, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
Like a dungeon dragon, like a dungeon dragon
[Verse 2: Eminem as Slim Shady]
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame
Twisted-ass mind, got a pretzel for a brain
An eraser for a head, fucking pencil for a frame
You don't like it then peel off
, 
bitch
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off, and I still wouldn't fuck you, slut
So wipe the smile on your grill off
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off
Get the wheels turning, spin, and wheel off
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie-rod
Quit hollering "Why, God?" He ain't got shit to do with it
Bygones'll never be bygones
, 
so won't be finished swallowing my wad
I ain't finished blowing it
, 
nice bra
Hope it'll fit a tough titty, bitch
, 
life's hard
I swear to God, life is a dumb blonde white broad
With fake tits and a bad dye job
Who just spit in my fucking face and called me a fucking tightwad
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod
And caught her stealing my music
, 
so I tied her arms and legs to the bed
Set up the camera and pissed twice on her
Look, two pees and a tripod!
The moral to the story is, life's treating you like dry sod?
Kick it back in its face
, my God
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd
But don't ask why, bitch (Ask why not)
[Hook: Eminem as Slim Shady]
The world-world is my punching bag and
If I'm garbage, you're a bunch of maggots
Make that face, go on, scrunch it up at me
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it
Like a, raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon
You fell off, off, 
they musta bumped your wagon
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end
I told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic
[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj as Roman Zolanski]
Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on?
Is it my fault that all of you bitches gone?
Shoulda sent a thank-you note, you little ho
Now I'mma wrap your coffin with a bow
"Nicki, she's just mad cause you took the spot"
Word, that bitch mad cause I took the spot?
Well, bitch, if you ain't shitting, then get off the pot
Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off your top
I hear them mumbling,
 
I hear the cackling
I got 'em scared, shook, panicking
Overseas, church, Vatican
You at a standstill, mannequin
You wanna sleep on me? Overnight?
I'm the motherfucking boss, overwrite
And when I pull up, vroom, motorbike
Now all my niggas getting buck, overbite
I see them dusty-ass Filas
, 
Levi's
Raggedy Ann, holes in your knee-highs
I call the play, now do you see why?
These bitches calling me Manning Eli
Manning Eli, these bitches calling me Manning Eli!!
[Verse 4: Eminem as Slim Shady]
All you lil' faggots can suck it, 
no homo
But I'mma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets
And I'm crooked enough to make straitjackets bend
Yeah, look who's back again
, bitch, keep acting as if
You had the same passion that I have, yeah, right
Still hungry, my ass, you assdicks had gastric bypass
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids but eyelash!
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fucking balcony
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass
You know what time it is, so why ask?
When Shady and Nicki's worlds clash, 
it's (high class) meets (white trash)
[Hook]
[Outro: Nicki Minaj as Martha Zolanski]
Roman, Roman! Stop it, stop it!
You've gone mad, mad, I tell you, mad!
You and this boy Slim Shady!
What's going on? They'll lock you away!
They'll put you in a jail cell! I promise!
Take your mother's warning, Roman, please
Back to bed! Run along! Let's go! Come on!
Wash your mouth out with soap, 
boys

[Part]
Ich rapp' lieber über Drive-bys
Als über irgendeine peinliche Scheiße
Wie du und deine Wuppertaler Homies
Die nur rumlabern von wegen, wir sind keine Gees
Aber wenn sie uns live sehen, kein Wort sagen und weit weg fliehen
Ich mein' das Pimpgehabe ernst
Okay, ich übertreibe manchmal, doch darin steckt immer ein wahrer Kern
Und das ist es, was ihr Wohlstand-Kids alle nicht glaubt
Wenn ihr bei den Eltern auf dem Sofa sitzt und Animes schaut
Und das ist dreist, Kid, was du da redest
Deine Betonung ist so behindert, kaum einer versteht es
Wenn du irgendetwas in den Takt nuschelst
Sogar noch ganz frech behauptest "Ey kuck, mein Text der puncht doch!"
Und ich versteh' nicht ganz, wieso du sagst, ich mach auf Chiss, Klub oder Sunshine Boy
Nigga, wieso raffst du nicht, dass das alles vollkommen verschiedene Styles sind
Und nur weil wir alle wie Zuhälter rappen, es nicht heißen muss, dass irgendeiner hier den anderen bitet?
Ich sag' auch nicht, dass du auf DeeLah machst, nur weil du scheiße flowst und betonst
Und dein Aussehen auch nicht das Wahre ist, du komischer Vogel
Und du solltest echt mal lernen, den Takt zu treffen, Spast, du battlest hier den Gangsterking
Aber du bist fast zu hässlich, um überhaupt von mir Beachtung zu bekommen
Bitches wollen mich haben so wie Taschen von Louis Vuitton
Ich bin on top of the game wie The Game Spacecaps
Und gebe dir keinerlei Props, Kid, sondern nur einige Faceslaps
Und du siehst dumm aus der Wäsche wie bei deinem positiven AIDS-Test
Nach deinem letzten Date mit so 'nem Typen aus dem Gaychat
[Outro]
Und wenn ich mich nicht irre, war das der Webmaster von schwul.de!

[Intro]
Between you and Biggie it was like, who's going to rule the nigga kingdom and shit basically, know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking election
(2Pac) It is that. Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that, it's like
[Hook]
And I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead?
Why am I fighting to live, if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see, when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give, when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live, if I'm just living to die?
[Verse 1 - The Notorious B.I.G.]
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls trying to turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missing
Show they toes you know they got stepped on
A fist full of bullets a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police picture that, nigga I'm too fat
I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't phase me
When he drop, take his Glock, and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - 2Pac]
It's on me
But still I'm having memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushing the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's trying to screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sipping 22's of brew
And now media is trying to test me
Got the press asking questions, trying to stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested and flipped
He screamed "thug life" and emptied the clip
Got tired of running from the police
[Outro - 2Pac]
They wanted a new regime
And my regime includes East coast
Includes West coast
[The Notorious B.I.G.]
I was more shocked than anything, you know what I'm saying?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him... 
Pac is a strong dude yo
I know dude, you know what I'm saying? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot
I was just more like, "again"
You know what I'm sayin'
He always gettin' shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm saying?
 But when he, when he died
I was just like, "whoa", you know what I'm saying?
Kinda took me by
I mean even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody, you know what I'm sayin'
Because there ain't no coming back from that

Chorus:
[Pace Won]
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up (Sing it with me!)
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
[Az-Izz]
Yo, I'm finally convinced my kindness and innocence
Is a crime in a sense, climbing a fence
Diagonally bent, dying in agony in a magically event
Outz in a fear of family presents
Capped in clak smoke, pack toast in a black coat
To roast motherfuckers, over lactose
Stay skeed off laced weed
I take cheese, and page trees in the Bricks
Rolling box of Tracies
[Pace Won]
Call a go-go dancer
Get up in that ass and wreck shop like colon cancer
Hit it from the back, bitch can't hold her pants up
Once for my cock, twice for my block
I got it locked like handcuffs
Pacer got a razor, get you and your man cut
Swing a blow you can't duck
Throw up your hands, what?
Nobody on earth could see Pacer
I get your shit then peel off like Speed Racer
Chorus
[Slang Ton]
I hit you bastards raps fast as Janet Jackson's coochie
Your raps is half mastered, mad average, wack bologna
And if you ever wanna get a deal
You should either OD off skill pills
Or steal my reel-to-reel
Most of y'all emcees ain't tight as y'all should be when
I'm tighter than the jeans that show hoochie chicks' coochie prints
Outsidaz, we hot as Hell's flames is
And I'm Slang-iz, my tapes get pumped like twelve gauges
[Eminem]
I'm so weeded (How weeded are you?)
I'm so weeded I can freestyle for sixteen bars (Ha ha ha)
Right off the top, then go back to the top
And then repeat it (Ha)
Write it down on the paper
And still be able to read it (Sorry)
I can't read, but I still write to my pen pals (Uh, uh, dear)
I can't fly, but I still float on cement clouds (Whee!)
I can't see cause my eyes already been gouged out
I been down with the Outz for ten thou-sand years
([Pace Won] So dunn, here?)
Some weird kids with piercings in more than one ear
Lauryn, huh? Hill?
([Pace won] There's more than one? IIIllll)
What? You want me to stop? Here?
Chorus
[Young Zee]
Yea
Your girl could suck my dick chewing Big Red
Till she choke and scrape her wisdom tooth on my dick head
Puff a tray bag, Outz never pay cabs
Bust a A-rab, front on taking us up eighth Ave
Yea, we all of the a volumes
What be the outcome?
We selling twenty million albums
Ay your record, ain't nobody buy that
You fell off, and had to take your five mic
And push a white Ac, with a bike rack
[Axe]
It's the A, the X, the E
Why pay for ass, if I can sex for free?
F' with we, what you expect to see
Death's your destiny,
 
when it's my time for rest in peace
Bet they find my pistol next to me
My dick is giving ecstasy
Shit I say, spread like leprosy
I'm on a quest to be, the best emcee
Living recklessly, cock the weaponry
Lay you on your back like Lei Wulong from Tekken 3
Yo follow, never question me
Chorus
[Pace Won]
C'mon yo
Bust your lip, rush ya clique, what?
Crush your chick, touch your trick, what?
Snuff your bitch, crush your whip, what?
Outz in the area tearing things up
Outworld baby

Yo
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me, people just want to see
If it's true, if it's you, what you say in your rap's, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation'll get you killed, if you feel it, kill it
If you conceal it, reveal it, being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it, till it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
[Hook: Eminem]
Bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
Even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I love pissin' you off, gets me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you mothafuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether its your fault or not
Cause
[Hook: Eminem]
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
Even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
Even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble
[Eminem]
Can I take great pleasure in introducing...
[Voice]
Decon Chrome
[Verse 3: Decon Chrome]
You thought you could have me beat
And get me too flee but I see what you motherfuckers tryna be
And now you wanna plea? nah way, cause now I foresee, me
Coming at you like a banshee, throw you into the dead sea
But now you gotsa run cause fool you done, and i've only just begun
I'm like a hired gun, travelling alone to the midnight sun, feeling
Like i've finally won, but no, why should you bestow, you make me sit below
In this free throw, well now this is how it will go you may take me as a joke
Everyday I wake up in a hazy smoke and you can't live in this shit
Cuz you're gonna choke, I'm sick of this shit
My friends taking me for granted and
Having me supplanted, and now here I am stranded alone
Thrown to the drop zone, but I guess
I can't grumble, cause I will never stumble!!!
[Hook: Eminem]
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
Even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
These shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
Even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble

[Intro]
(Same song and dance)
Damn, girl everywhere I go
(Same song and dance)
I like the way you move all over the globe
(Same song and dance)
Something about it man
(Same song and dance)
In the pale moonlight
[Verse 1]
I'm looking at you yeah girl, you're kinda tooken back by
The whole rapper thing aren't ya
Probably thinking you'll get slapped so damn hard you
Won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya
Couple rape charges people think you're a monster
The police constantly bugging you non-stop
I walk up on you, 
"Well, hello Tonya"
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck
You outta gas? Do you got a flat?
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundry mat, I got your back
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back
And sit up front, I'm not asking it's a trap
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap
In broad day and no masks for this attack
I heard 'em say exact opposites attract
If that's a fact, it'll take task force to get you back,
 come on
[Hook]
Yeah, baby do that dance
It's the last dance you'll ever get the chance to do
Girl shake that ass, you ain't never gonna break that glass
That windshield's too strong for you
I said yeah baby, sing that song
It's the last song you'll ever get the chance to sing
You sexy little thing, show me what you got, give it your all
Look at you bawl why you crying to me
 
(Same song and dance)
[Verse 2]
The first victim I had she was a big one
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun
She was the girl the media always picked on
In and out of rehab every four to six months
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts
At Nickelodeon flashed the little kids once
What an event it was, I was sitting in front
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in son
Look here she comes, I'd better pull out the big guns
Hello Lindsay, you're looking a little thin hun
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in cunt
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want
Girl I'm just kidding, let me start over again hun
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention
Come with me to 
Brighton
, 
let me relieve your tension
You little wencher, 
murder wasn't my intention
If I wanted to kill you, it woulda already been done
Slowly she gets in and I begin to lynch her
With 66 inches of extension cord
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My second victim was even bigger than the first
Pop star, icon, the whole works
She played the little schoolgirl when she first
Burst up on the scene, it seemed that the world was hers
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts
It irked me, it made me mad at first,
 
I lashed out in my songs
But what was really going, on was that I had developed a crush
I just didn't know how to tell it to her
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons or
Footage of me impaling myself on an elephant tusk?
We'll settle this once and for all, I'mma tell her at dusk
Tonight, tonight is the night and tell her I must
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos
 and just
Climb the gate and ring the bell like "Hello, my love"
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feeling you Britney
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one
Ever since the schoolgirl juvenile delinquent
I've been feeling you, ooh-ooh, girl you sexy little gal you
Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke
And just as soon as you pass out
 in your 
alphabet soup
I'm 'bout to make a new outfit outta you
New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit outta you, shoot
Now show me how you move, baby do how are you do
[Hook]
[Outro]
Same kicking and screaming
Same crying and sobbing (Same song and dance)
Same begging and pleading
Same yelling and bleeding (Same song and dance)

[Hook]
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood (Hollywood!)
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood (Why do I feel this way?!)
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
Saying goodbye, saying goodbye to Hollywood
[Verse 1]
I thought I had it all figured out, I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself laying on my knees in cuffs
Which shoulda been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff
And just leave, how come I couldn't see this shit myself?
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt
Knowing damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me, the minute shit was heated, she just bailed
I'm standing here swinging at like thirty people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashing the heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look
At nothing, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood
I probably should, these problems are piling all at once
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up
I think I'm bottoming out, but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good
I'd be to my daughter, laying in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps
Of my dad, cause I hate him so bad
The worst fear that I had was growing up to be like his fucking ass
Man, if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it
For me to have this much appeal like this, is sick
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick
Publicity stunt my ass, conceal my fucking dick
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp
On the fact I've sacrificed everything I have
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more than I ever could of asked
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil I'll never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine going from being a no one to seeing
Everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceeing
It's fucking crazy, cause all I wanted was to give Hailie
The life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated so I'm saying
[Hook]
[Outro]
Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood (Goodbye)
Please don't cry for me (It's been real)
When I'm gone for good (This shit is not for me)
So goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood (I'm not a fucking star)
Please don't cry for me (No way)
When I'm gone for good 
(I'm going back home)

[Intro: Eminem]
This ain't beef man
I don't know what the fuck to call it
But no beef
Whattup X
[
Verse
 1: 
Eminem
]
I float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me
I'd have my motherfucking ass kicked by Moby
If I let some bitch in the Can like Bis cop over me
To do war and 
try to bring my cr
ew back down
I'll never stoop to that level to do that now
I got a new cat
This time I'm pulling two gats out
With bullets
I finally got something to shoot at now
[Verse 2: Xzibit]
Let's see who got they city on lock
Let's see who got the better aim with the Glock
Let's see who come out on top
Let's see who really want their name in the streets
Let's see who wanna die the same time as me
And make ends meet
Now was I blessed with a gift or cursed with a curse
I follow hearse after hearse with verse after verse
And I'll be damned if I let Billy dance Dupri
Or anybody swing an axe at my family tree, so now
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I love it when you niggas be talking, saying my name
Seems like your mouth is not connected to your brain
Two-zero-zero-three, and shit, it ain't the same
Better have a strap my nigga, simple and plain
Put your nuts on the table, my nigga let's play the game
Hurt you so long, you'll be a-ddicted to pain
I don't wanna hear what you meant, do not explain
Right before you lay in your coffin, ho say my name
[Verse 3: Xzibit]
Why do you hate me
I came from nothing
Blood sweat and tears
You did not create me
How can you doubt me
You don't know shit about me
There'd be no West coast without me
Cut with the bullshit
I struggle for survival
And now you trying to act like my rival
Watch what you say partner, it's a small earth
Don't play games with your life nigga, it's not worth
All the pain, all the agony
All the horror, all the tragedy
Put your hands up people, it's time to fight now
I beat holes in your chest, remain hostile
Threaten my life, c'mon
One day you'll understand
They say that pride is the sign of a foolish man
So who the fuck you think you talking to
Live and direct in the flesh, I'm right in front of you
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him
Nobody ganged up til he came back and jacked him
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him
I could have been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him
Purple, for mimicking him with 
two rapping Urkels
I could of snapped, took it past rap and hurt you
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you
I Square Dance
 
cause I'm sick of rapping circles
Around these clowns, stready trying to call me out
It's like I'm listening to motherfucking dogs meow
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about, c'mon
(I) No gangsta you ain't either
(Will) But I know that I spit ether
(Not) I shit across your belly
(Lose) Show you I'm not R. Kelly
X, pass me the weed
I'mma put my ashes out on his ass
For the last time man
Watch your fucking mouth
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
For the last time man, I'm through

[Dre] 
So I'm out the game huh?
[Em] Huh? Yo Dre, 
WE RIDIN
?
[Dre] Whatever
[Em] 
Haha! Well I'm witcha homie!
[Dre] Okay; 
let's handle the small shit
[Eminem]
I was born to brew up storms and stir up shit
Kick up dust, 
cuss 'til I slur up spit
Grew up, too quick, went through too much knew too much shit
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup, bitch!
Thick and rich, sick and twisted
, 
Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk the shit for what it's worth
'til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth
And if I fumble the verse, keep going
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pulled, no punches that's weak shit
Fake shit
, 
if I ever take shit I'll EAT shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
[Dr. Dre]
Creep with me, as we take a lil' trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
(But what about 
Jermaine
?) 
Fuck Jermaine
He don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think, I don't read
Your lil' interviews, and see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you I'mma step on you and not even know it
You midget, Mini-Me with a bunch of little Mini-Yous
Running around your backyard swimming pools
Over 80 million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten or eleven-year-olds
[Hook 2X: Eminem]
Cause what you say is what you say, say what you say
How you say it whenever you saying it, just remember
How you said it when you were spraying it
So who you playing with huh.. huh.. huh.. huh?
[Eminem]
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie Cup, if you ever mix me up
Or CONFUSE ME with a Canibus or Dre with a DUPRI!
We'll rub it in, every club you're in will have you
Black balled and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain!
Dre ain't having it; long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate
[Dr. Dre]
If there was some magic shit
I could wave over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
[Eminem]
If I could only use this power for good
I wouldn't; not even if I could
[Dr. Dre]
From the hood and I'm a hornet
And I'mma only sting when I'm cornered
[Eminem]
And I'mma only sucker-punch and swing without warnin'
And swing to knock somebody's fucking head off
Cause I know if they get up I won't get a chance to let off
Another punch I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a FUCK!
 
White 'Pac, so much spunk
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill'
And grow up, to be Atilla, go nuts and be a killa!
[Dr. Dre]
And I'm, something of a phenom'
One puff of the chron',
 
I'm unstoppable
I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us (come on!)
[Hook 2X]
[Dr. Dre]
Now anybody who knows Dre
Knows I'm about fast cars
 and 
Alizé
, partying all day
But I handle my business cause it's work before play
Don't look for trouble but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
You fuck my night up I'mma fuck up your day
Bullet with your name
, sending it your way
That goes for anyone who walks through that doorway
Cause this is my space, you invade it, live to regret it
And you die trying to violate it
Fuck around, get 
annihilated
; 
eyes dilated
[Eminem]
Heh, like my old lady
Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
Think too many things
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything
Catch a contact then I'm gone and I'm back
I speed right; and my looseleaf's my launchpad
[Dr. Dre]
And I can pull any string
Don't have to prove anything,
 
catch a contract on your head
You headed West
, talk shit about Dre?
You better get a vest, and invest
In something to protect your head and neck
[Eminem]
And it's back and forth all day like
 
Red & Meth
I joke when I say I'm best
In the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest
And if I ever do live to be a legend
I'mma die a sudden death
Five mics in 
, ain't holdin' my fuckin' breath
But I'll suffocate for the respect
'fore I'll breathe to collect a fucking check
[Hook 2X]
[Dre] 
Watch your fucking mouth
[Timbaland]
Yo, this Timbaland, tell them I said suck *chka* MY dick

[Intro]
[Dre] So I'm out the game, huh
[Eminem] Yo Dre, we riding?
[Dre] Whatever
[Eminem] Haha. Well I'm witcha homie
[Dre] Okay, let's handle the small shit

As a producer who has 
worked with Detroit wordsmith Eminem
 early on his career, Scott Storch was asked to share his earliest memories of the rapper during a recent interview with 
Mikey T The Movie Star
Storch says he was introduced to Eminem through Dr. Dre
 who doted on 
Em’s lyrical skills
. The New York beatsmith also revealed that he was surprised to find that Eminem was “another white dude" upon meeting the rapper
“I remember I was working with Dr. Dre,” Storch said. “And he was telling me about Marshall. I mean, I had heard about him from his Rawkus days. But he was telling me ‘Oh, I got this dude [called] Eminem. He’s ridiculous. He’s like the best rapper I swear to God in the world. Blah blah blah blah blah.’ And he came in and I wasn’t expecting like for another white dude to be walking in the room. I thought I was the only white dude. And then I didn’t know he was speaking up this guy that’s this most amazing rapper is coming in.”
Storch went on to comment on Eminem’s creativity and energy in the studio, qualities he says he sees in 
Chris Webby
, an artist he’s currently working with
“I remember that day we were fixing up a record of his and we did that ‘Just The Two Of Us’ that day,” he said. “And I don’t know—I was blown away then. He was something completely different. He reminds me of—like his energy and just all his creativity—like the greatest. 
And I saw something the other night in this dude I’m working with, Chris Webby
. And it kinda reminded me a little bit of that type of vibe. Really into the craft and excited about the records…I remember being in the studio at some point. I forget what album it was with Em. And Em was going so crazy. 
He was so passionate about just adding like all the little sound effects to the songs. Like a glass breaking or anything, a car screeching.
 The sounds. Like all that stuff and just being so meticulous with it and making it real.”
In addition to working with Eminem, Storch also reportedly worked with Dr. Dre on his much-delayed album, Detox. 
Nearly four years ago the producer revealed that Dre’s album was only three tracks away from completion during an interview with DJ Skee
Following his return to music last year, Scott Storch has worked with the likes of 
Fat Joe
, 
Pusha T
, 
DJ Khaled
, and a 
handful of other artists

[Intro: Women Singing]
Ain't no one special, special like you (4X)
I been searchin', but your the one I want in my life baby (4X)
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm reminiscing on your tenderness and the snuggling and teasing
Missing what I remember, kissing and hugging and squeezing
Bugging and weezing, I'm having trouble when breathing
It's even tougher when sleeping
But there's a couple of reasons that I'm suffering and grieving
For loving and leaving
, you're all I'm thinking of in the evening
You got my knees buckling and weakening
Thoughts of nothing but freaking that I'm struggling to keep in
And interrupt when I'm speaking
I got some game that I'm preparing to run
The way your lips sparkle and glare in the sun
You got your hair in a bun, no matter what you're wearing you stun
Cause your comparing to none
, I wanna share in the fun
I feel a passionate lust when I imagine it just alone at last when it's us
I see you grasping to trust, but my intentions are good
The seed is passing in dust
I'm not asking to rush and answer immediately
I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me
If you agree to repeat after me: "I love you" ("I love you, baby")
Cause I just need you to see, how much I'm eager to be
Your man legally wed, your love's keeping me fed
This is easily said, so you can lead or be led
If you care to be down cause ain't nobody like you no where to be found
[Hook: Women Singing]
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (4X)
[Verse 2: 
Denaun Porter
]
Baby it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo
Let's set a day up so you can fall on through
We'll take a spin in a Lexus you can chill for dinner and breakfast
Long enough to see how this gentleman sexes
We'll start it out with caviar, Dom Pérignon
And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on
We'll take it slow, see nobody will hurry things
I got the Izze, the Bacardi, and Hurricane
If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thing that day
It's still all right cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray
Your an incredible one that's rare, in bed with edible underwear
You look impeccable, nothing compares
I dream of freaking you, the women that will speak it too so
It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do so
Now we all set to play, only thing left to say is
When you step away, baby but don't forget the negligee
[Hook: Women Singing]
I been searching, but your the one I want in my life baby (8X)
Ain't no one special, special like you (2X)

[Intro]
(Like a verbal seduction, seduction when I tell them girls on the floor)
I don't know, man, just feels like, we're a lot different
It kinda feels like, I'm on a whole different page right now than you
It feels strange but um, I guess it's kinda like, it's kinda like
[Verse 1]
I feel like I’m morphing into something that's so incredible
That I’m dwarfing all competitors
Better get your girlfriend in check
It’s psychological warfare, endorphins I effect
Your self-esteem shatters as dialect comes blasting out your deck
She loves me, so much passion
You’d expect this sort of reaction from her, yet
You strong-arm, you’re fucking corny
You try to turn your charm on
Cause you just think you’re Bishop the Don Juan
But if you think you’re fucking with me, homie, you’re on one
I’m cocking my head back like Ed Lover, come on, son
She’s on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant
Your boys are like, she’s fucking with dude
She wants son, homeboy, you better get a clue
She’s on my dick cause I spit better than you
What you expect her to do? How you expect her to act in the sack
When she’s closing her eyes, fantasizing of
Digging her nails in my back to this track
[Hook x2]
Seduction, seduce
Ain’t nobody who’s as good at what I do
Cause one minute she loves you
The next she don’t, she’s been stolen from you
[Verse 2]
She’s sitting there getting liquored up at the bar
She says it’s quicker to count the things that ain’t wrong with you than to count the things that are
There’s a seven-disc CD changer in her car
And I’m in every single slot, and you’re not, aw
I’m the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet: a star
And I’m not about to sit back and just keep rhyming one syllable, nah
Switch it up and watch them haters not give it up
Cause they’re just not good enough but I’m not giving up
'Til I get my respect, and I won’t stop
'Til I get enough, cause I’m not living up to my own expectations, aw
That hater alarm is sounding off and Obama took the bomb from my name
So quit crying that I took your dame, homie she’s my dame
You sadly mistaken if you thinking that I’m not on my game, boy
And things just ain’t been the same since the day that I came for it
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank, boy
But you got a hard on for me, what you hollering my name for?
It’s your bitch on my dick, ain’t my dang fault, man,
 
I can’t call it
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3]
It’s like we're playing lyrical tug of war with your ear, you hear it? Girl, come here
Put your ear up to the speaker, dear, while I freak this world premiere
Seducing her, loosen up with a little freestyle, wait, am I losing ya?
Am I making you look bad? Well I got news for you, homie, you’re losing her
Oh wait, she don’t like when I spit it fast,
 
am I trying to show how, let me slow it
 
down some
It’s still gonna be a blowout,
 
you’re gonna wanna throw out your whole album
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something to see
If you can save any of it, punk,
 
but none of it’s fucking with me
Prick, you really feeling that bullshit?
 
You think you killing them syllables?
Quit playing, these beats ain’t nothing to fool with
They call me Fire Marshall: I shut the shit down
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round
I am also the opposite of what you are like
You’re a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic
I am awesome and you are just awe-struck
She’s love-stricken, she’s got her jaw stuck from sucking my dick, aw fuck
[Hook x2]

[Eminem]
What's up with everybody beefin'
Everybody seem like they wanna beef
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody beefin' with everybody
This shit is crazy
[Verse 1: Dogmatic]
This is a bomb scare, fires on your hair
Terrorists live here, but I don't care
I'm making pot holes when I stomp, so don't stare
I stop to stomp competiton, with both fair
How dare, little soldier at ease
We shake down these streets, like Parkinson's Disease
We parking the road trees, plus load the weapons
Everything to six shooters, to high tech ones
If a green beans things, to my suggestion
Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion
With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic
An underground nigga but this nigga's above average
It's serious! who can understand what I'm saying?
Yo Slim, tell them niggas (Eminem: We ain't playing!)
It's like you open a can of worms or smoked yams
I got bloody hands and burners that make you dance!
[Hook: Eminem]
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious! Do you really want beef
Do you really wanna end up, missing yo front teeth
And see yo family, getting smoked like a blunt leaf
And wrapped up in a zip-lock bag, like lunch meat
This shit is serious!
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
I'm the only one yo bitch to touch a
Type a brother that'll, fuck yo mother, wit a fishnet rubber
I'mma misfit slash, nitwit
I love to put up biscuts, straight to a niggas lips, it'll fit
A biligerent and rowdy fellow
I'll dump yo body, and still fly away to Maui, on a teller
When it comes to beefin', it ain't no explain'
I'll change ya lauguage, wit a stainless
I'll contain, wit a name which to make you famous
I'mma deranged pit, I'll bang you till ya back touch ya anus
Don't ever take me to court, I'll whack the plantiff
Then beat the fuck out the baliff
A heniuos, miscellaneous, nigga never miss, when the AK lift
I paint ya face wit, any weapon, just like "The Matrix"
They ain't steppin', don't even say shit
You heard about the bodies in my basement, you joinin' them, face it
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Proof]
Laugh indictive, like 
Kim
 lipstick, and get a nose bleed
My blow speed, is like my hands working ten stick shifts
Captain ask, to stick my finger in the (???)
And snatching the driver out the black Benz
Smashing his contact lens, my life start when his contract ends
"Go kiss-and-tell, and contact Kim!"
Let's be factually, actually, y'all ain't after me
Got (???) wit +Regis+, y'all beef is without the +Kathy Lee+
Told y'all my battlery, and go to war happily
How you gon' call my bluff, when you scared to send a fax to me
My factulty guns drawn, one wrong move dudey
And it's too heads on ya body, into a gangster movie
For lot being real, scared to pop wit the steel
It got skeletons in my house, every closet is filled
Now how does it feel, with this Baretta to ya 
dome
And to know that ya mom's know, that you was never coming home
[Hook] w/ Ab-libs
[Outro: Eminem]
You know what I'm sayin'
You want beef, we taking it to yo face
Fuck it, Dirty Dozen, Slim Shady
D-12, this shit is serious!

Here it is, there it is ladies and gentlemen

This yo man J-U-S and this track called "Serious"
Promatic featuring Eminem and Swift
[Eminem]
What's up with everybody beefin'
Everybody seem like they wanna beef
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody beefin' with everybody
This shit is crazy
[Verse 1 - Dogmatic]
This is a bomb scare, fires on your hair
Terrorists live here, but I don't care
I'm making pot holes when I stomp, so don't stare
I stop to stomp competiton, with both fair
How dare, little soldier at ease
We shake down these streets, like Parkinson's Disease
We parking the road trees, plus load the weapons
Everything to six shooters, to high tech ones
If a green beans things, to my suggestion
Burn a big whole in your belly, like indigestion
With one question, who the fuck is Dogmatic
An underground nigga but this nigga's above average
It's serious! who can understand what I'm saying?
Yo Slim, tell them niggas (Eminem: We ain't playing!)
It's like you open a can of worms or smoked yams
I got bloody hands and burners that make you dance!

This shit is serious! Do you really want beef

[Intro:Eminem]
Ladies and gentlemen, make some noise!
You ready to get this shit started or what?
Alright, cause I brought some friends with me too
[Eminem]
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin I'm back
I could relax
 but I'd rather 
stack ammo on tracks
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black
Out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniels and 'gnac
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturing
Double shot of Bacardi
, 
party, vision is blurring
Whoa-oh, I can't see shit, my words get to slurring
Uh-oh!
 
You can call me R. Kelly now, you're in
Trouble!
 
What's occurring befo', after, and during the show
Has no bearing on the bad news I'm bearing, whoa
What is it, wordplay? No, I'm pushing you out the do'
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow
Now stomp your fucking feet 'til you get to squishing a ho
It's pandemonium, standing o when you see him, oh
Damn baby you look good, you're giving me wood
You should pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood
It's neck work, get her polly on
, you and me both
Break bread while I'm copping over this game to pinch a loaf
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?
Who claims to be spitting the same flames as me? 
I'm Kanye when he crashed
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas
Destroyed the front end
Deployed the damn airbags from the dash
Went through 'em and laughed
Came back an hour after the accident
And bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!
So stop faking the funk and start shaking your ass
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap
And 
Just Blaze on the track
, what's the fuck's more amazing than that?
Slut, answer me that, 
Royce where you at?
[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm right here Fire Marshall
, 
verbal pair of pliers I pry apart you
Lump on your head designed by a bar stool
Designed by a cartoon
Before I need to be hired, Jimmy I'll fire Marshall
The 9 tucked against the lining
I pull it out and flip your partner upside-down
Like y'all are a couple 69ing
It's like Rick James is shooting up your house, nigga!
{
} FUCK YO' COUCH NIGGA!
You're screaming, "Fuck the world!" with your middle finger up
While I'm over here shoving my dick in a hole in the mud
My bitch know I'm perfectly fit for murder
Because I murdered her,
 so you can call me
Nickel to 
O.J. to Glove
I got a Posse of Insane Clowns
Blow your brains on your opposite ear
And ask you how your brain sounds
Bad, Evil,
 
we go Alfred E. Neumann mad 
cerebral
You on your last burrito!
(What that mean Nickel?) 
It's a wrap if you eating
Get a beat then terrorize that bitch like I'm Middle Eastern
Slaughterhouse
 on FIRE, nobody touching that
Good day and good night, 
Ortiz, yo, where the FUCK you at?
[Joell Ortiz]
I'm right here in my Nike Airs
, 
Buzz Light-years
Ahead of my mic peers
, quite scary to look at a nightmare
Where my book at? I write fear in the heart of you tight squares
I harbor the art of my nice wear
It's type weird cause that made me hotter than my dear
Uncle Al's breath after polishing off his ninth beer
Homie chill, listen, I swear
I'm God, I give tracks a Holy-feel, and they bite ears
I'm right here, why wouldn't I be?
Just waiting to be hooked to IV as Mumm-Ra's
Well,
 when you look at my pee
And this joint no exception, so just point a direction
And record the pig's oink when I rip his intestine
This isn't just an infection
This won't go away with penicillin injections
Millions of questions arose
After they did an inspection, what I exhibit
Seems to be non-contagious yet anybody can get it
Aw shiddit, I did it again, when I liddift this pen
I emitted this phlegm
, this time it's alongside 
Emiddinem
So tell a friend to tell a friend write a 
disgusting hook
Jump in shark water and swim
, yo where the fuck is Crook?
[Crooked I]
I'm right here letting the 
shotty
 pop, quick as a karate chop
Get your body shot, get your top chopped, like a lollipop
Call it Maserati drop, in the body shop
Get your mommy knocked
And your Uncle Tommy 
molli-wopped
I take your life to the ninth inning
A knife in the gunfight, I love it, me and my knife winning
I laugh when you fall, the shit'll be funny
I'll buy my bitch a new ass and watch her sit on my money
Man, all the bitches holla - they wanna drop my britches
Then jaw on my dick and swallow, leave drawers in this Impala
I ball like Iguodala
I bear more arms than 6 koalas
As soon as I draw, get sent to Allah
Bilinguist don, I kill with the tongue, 
I'm Atilla the Hun
I'm Genghis Khan,
 I'm a genius spawn
I pillage your village for fun
, an egregious con
A syllable gun, real as they come,
 
Long Beach Saddam!
Slaughterhouse equals 
swine flu
, 
are South flying
We do it to try to do without tryin
(Slaughterhouse!) Cause to it's us it's so easy
Where's Jumpoff Joe Beezy?

[Verse 1]
Comin' to you live at Shade 45 Invasion
The only radio station that plays in rotation
The Shady the slash with the Aftermath

Maybe you may hear some Jada mixed with a plate of some D Block
Splash of 2Pac

Outta whatever we want this is Shady
And we gonna pump, pump the fuck out our own shit
From 50, Obie, Twizzy, Stat Quo
And we won't quit fuckin' you up
And we can keep sayin' fuckin' you up
Even till the FCC sayin' shut this dude up
Duck tape a his mouth a do somethin'
Quick fucka do fuck poppa do pop
Skippy dippy

Chinga tu madre!
I start drama all day hemm delala
Comin' across your scanners it's the brand new station
Shade 45, motherfuckin'
 
Slim Shady
 
bitch and
 
Green Lantern
Shady in the place to be, see
And it takes what I got to rock the mic right
And that was a freestyle too bitch so suck my dick if you do not like

Hey, what’s a demon?
A demon is fun, a lot more fun…
[Intro: Obie Trice]
Guess who’s back from Shady’s faction
You gotta know that cuz you made him Platinum
‘
case you look past ‘em and ask him
Is OT alright? I say easy bastards
Thought I wouldn’t come back? Nigga you backwards?
He came from crack to obtaining his classics
Knowin’ all that, get your ass in action
Cuz now you have access to what’s happenin’
[Verse One: Obie Trice]
The flows eccentric
O is back with a mouth full of inventions
To hold my fans
‘Til the next album comes, like my second one has
?? slept on, it’s a thing of the past
I guess got some ?? made ‘em all laugh
When I shoulda been strapped, up with gats
But, I’m from the Ave so what’s up with that?
Cuz on previous tracks Obie’s clutchin’ mags
Look at him kickin’ with fat chicks why would he brag?
What possesses him to do a song like that?
Shut the fuck up!
My nigga what’s up?
Cats with no humor, in the club mugged up
You gon’ get a facial tumor
Assuming that that looks persuasive or invasive to him
This is neither the time or place to pursue him
Baby party it up with Shady, under the influence
[Hook: Eminem]
You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
Yea were wilin’, yea were crazy!
(Whoo) Yea come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo)
You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
(Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us
Throw me in the club let’s get fucked up!
[Verse Two: Obie Trice]
Okey dokey, Obie’s back in the lab runnin’ the track
On my second lap, ahead of these fags
Marshall Mathers laced the track
So I ride that as if he would have
Havin’ a blast with a half a glass of Cognac
Next to my pen and pad
If I wanna get my abs intact call Curtis Jack for that
Make chicks have asthma attacks
The reaction is massive on the ??
Shut the fuck up!
My bitches what’s up?
Cats that perfuming in the club hugged up
You should get a different human
Assumin’ the dude you’re in tune with is wearing PINK
Instincts to tell you he’s a freak
He ain’t interested in you, he’s lookin’ at G
(Hahaha)
[Hook: Eminem]
You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
Yea were wilin’, yea were crazy!
(Whoo) Yea come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo)
You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
(Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us
Throw me in the club let’s get fucked up!
[Verse Three: Obie Trice]
No rehearsals the flow is cursed
I spit it in cursive you know it’s curtains
Return with a banger that’s so assertive
DJ spinnin’ ‘em in circles certainly
Hence the urgency, servin’ them since the birth of me
Get an intense verse from Obie – Wan Kenobi
One and only, nothing like a phony
Coordinate and macaroni
Plus I clap your homie
Actin’ like he ain’t have access to madness
??
Fuck that, let’s relax a moment
Before we fuck around over react and blow it
Do it for the folks those who know how to act enjoyment
Actually this is Shady gatherin’, spoil it
It’ll beat that ass like a Prince performance
[Hook: Eminem]
You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
Yea were wilin’, yea were crazy!
(Whoo) Yea come on Sha-a-a-ady! (Whoo)
You can’t stop us Shady baby
So come party with my crazy group
(Whoo) Were not dead, come on party it up with us
Throw me in the club let’s get fucked up!

[Intro]
Yo
Yeah
Listen up
This one goes out to all that disrupt
Yo
[Verse 1]
I could say that being stressed comes in an array
But it's always the same feeling everyday
I feel like i'm Singled out and on display
I ain't no motherfucking manikin 
(hey!)
I whip out purple light sabers to slay you haters like Anakin Sky-walker
There's a wrong name, fucking wrong order
Where's Mr Porter, Kuniva and Bizarre's daughter?
Yo Swifty, Slim Shady's a rap hoarder
He'll suck up any rapper in the game without a thought, better step away
Everyday, he's the best, fuck the rest, even the one's with fucking breasts
Yo Wayne, you'll need to sort your leopard panties out before you get some rest
I came to claim my name, soon i'll be the best
Fuck what you think of me, yes I know i'm skin-ny
Shit I got thin knees, but see that's what no gym does to me, ye
Oh shit cous, I'm about to miss my buss
I'll be right back i'm in a rush
(YUEAH!)
[Hook]
Fuck i'm a rush, sat in the back of this dirty bus
No one bothers to cuss, I thought it was a must
I guess I must of just hushed the fuckers inside my head
Because you pieces of crust are locked in my shed
X2
[Verse 2]
Put down your pen hen, listen up, take a breather it's half 10
Grab that shit up and put it b-e-hind-us, fuck it, there is no more trust
It's e-m-ptiness, get off the bus, fall right down
Crown flies off you're so high clown, This is an nuisance but don't frown
There's a stupid whore producing lust
Which is fucking you up leaving you to dust, blood rushes to your head
Now your head begins to shred-up thoughts of taunts
Coming from these groupie dorks, I can see how it haunts
Release the anger, buckle your knees
As you start to squeeze, the anger out, but your mental mind stake is a drought
You can't shout, neither can you fight, 
(you)
 trout
But it's okay, I understand you just want to go away
From this place, But you gotta sort yourself out mate
This is just a dinner plate, eat up all the crabs and shit them away
Because after today, you'll want to rise above the stress and hate
Grab a grate and smash down these trait-ors your's buis-ness isn't his
Fuck this quizz, too much time on my hands to fuck around with this bitch
Mr snitch quit the backstabbing shit, before I back hammer, before I grab-her
Fuck, i'm starting to be rude, fuck the feud, i'm more poisonous than crude-oil
Might as well boil, thse fucking rappers, fuck the nappers
I feel like i'm wasting my time 
so i'm no longer gonna write this rhyme
[Hook]
Fuck i'm a rush, sat in the back of this dirty bus
No one bothers to cuss, I thought it was a must
I guess I must of just hushed the fuckers inside my head
Because you pieces of crust are locked in my shed
X2
[Bridge]
So yeah
That's it
That's how I feel
Fuck these hoes man, fuck these haters man, fuck these fake ass friends
Fuck everybody 
(everybody)

[Intro: Eminem & Nate Dogg]
Shady, Aftermath
 
(Look at that bitch, shit - hey!)
There she go, shaking that ass on the floor
Bumping and grinding that pole
The way she's grinding that pole
I think I'm losing control
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Get buzzed, get drunk, get crunk, get fucked up
Hit the strip club don't forget ones get your dick rubbed
Get fucked, get sucked, get wasted, shit faceted
Pasted, plastered, puke drink throw up, get a new drink
Hit the bathroom sink, throw up
Wipe your shoe clean, got a routine goin'
Still got a few chunks on them shoestrings showin'
I was dehydrated
 till the beat vibrated
I was revived as soon as this Biyitch gyrated
Them hips and 
licked them lips
 and that was it
I had to get 
Nate Dogg
 in to 
sing some shit
[Verse 2: Nate Dogg]
Two to the one from the one to the three
I like good pussy
 
and I like good tree
Smoke so much weed you wouldn't believe
And I get more ass than a toilet seat
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy
I've been to the motherfuckin' mountain top
Heard motherfuckers talk, seen em drop
If I ain't got a weapon I'mma pick up a rock
And when I bust yo ass I'm gon' continue to rock
Getcha ass of the wall with your 
two left feet
It's real easy just follow the beat
Don't let that fine girl pass you bye
Look real close cause strobe lights lie
[Verse 3: Nate Dogg]
We about to have a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go 'head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl with a body and a sexy strut
Wanna get it poppin baby step right up
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I'm lookin' for a girl that will do whatever the fuck
I say, every day she be givin it up
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Ohh girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
Come on girl, shake that ass for me, shake that ass for me
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I'm a menace, a dentist, an oral hygienist
Open your mouth for about four or five minutes
Take a little bit of this fluoride rin-inse
Swish but don't spit it, swallow it now finish
Yeah; me and 
Nate D-O Double-G
Looking for a couple bitches with some double D's
Pop a little champagne and a couple E's
Slip it in her bubbly, we finna finna have a party
[Verse 5: Nate Dogg]
We about ave a party (turn the music up)
Let's get it started (Go head shake your butt)
I'm lookin for a girl I can fuck in my 
Hummer truck
Apple Bottom jeans
 
and a big ol' butt
Some girls they act retarded
Some girls are bout it bout it
I want a bitch to sit at the crib with no panties on
Knows that she can but she won't say no
[Bridge: Nate Dogg]
Now look at this lady all in front of me, sexy as can be
Tonight I want a slut, would you be mine?
Heard you was freaky from a friend of mine
[Eminem]
Now I hope you don't get mad at me
But I told Nate you was a freak
He said he wants a slut, hope you don't mind
I told him how you like it from behind
[Hook]
[Repeat Verse 3]
[Repeat Intro]
[Outro: Eminem]
God! I ain’t leaving without you, bitch
You're coming home with me
And my boy, and his boy - and his boy, and his girl
Haha, Nate Dogg!

[Eminem]
Woo! 
Shady, Aftermath
 (B-G-O-V)
Look at that bitch, shit! Hey!
There she goes, shakin that ass on the flo'
Bumpin and grindin that pole
The way she's grindin that pole (yeah, yeah)
I think I'm losing control (Bobby, Bobby, Bobby CREEK!)
[Bobby Creekwater]
I bought a girl Patron
, I get in the Henn' I'm gone
My eyes ain't clear and I'm long so she hearin me wrong
I'm kinda in the zone cause the DJ playin my song
Just another opportunity for sayin I'm known
I'm from Atlanta, so Southern ain't just a part of my grammar
I can dump and cock my hammer for any nigga with ammo
But I came here to get on Goose and Tropicana
Get loose, put some more in my juice and your caboose
Sippin everything from white cran to deuce-deuce
With nothin to gain but my grains and loose tooths
Eminem came, then Obie, Stat and Proof too
Bobby Creek is in the place, 
the name is new too
But the money been around, my drinks is ten around
I can make her spin around, least she keep her dinner down
Simmer down, we can hit the telly when the fun stops
And I let you and your girl come tickle my gumdrops, yo
[Nate Dogg]
Three to the one from the one to the three
I met a bad bitch last night in the D
Let me tell you how I made her leave with me
Conversation and Hennessy

[Eminem] OBIE TRICE!
[Obie Trice]
One slug couldn't snuff young cuz
Goodness gracious, haters stay on his nuts
Wood just like a hoodrat chick who was curious
Serious full breast ready to touch
Who's that in the Coupe blew back with a blue new hat
Givin head while he poppin the clutch?
True that I had a few, 
Obie rollin with Bruce
And Nathaniel annually knockin the boots
It's all manual the way I get 'em outta they shoes
Talk a lil' shit then they anus'll ooze
Hock a lil' spit on my dang-a-lang boo
It's Sha-dy; you know the name of the crew
You know the aim is to bang you in a mansion
With a Magnum
 when the night came to the matinee
Mathers, Nate, Obie - came to party
You better ask somebody

Go to 5th Ave. just to shop for Chanel, huh
She the one that ain't really got shit, huh
A little bitch that really ain't got tits, huh
Fuckin slut with a chest enhanced
Titty dances to pay for her breast implants
[Eminem]
Anybody wit knives, we got knives too
More sharp, and ready to outslice you
About 5 dudes deep, who outsize you
And wanna see insides comin' outside you
Get me drunk, and I'll drink anything you can think
What up Miss. Bitch? (You, what's up with the ring?
You married?) Shit nah, I'm still mingling bitch
I just wanted this ring, this is the only finger it fits
What up with you, you married? (Nah, I'm divorced)
Of course you are, you little fuckin' trailer park whore
(Trailer? I don't live in no trailer
I live in a mobilization unit, for your information)
Bitch, I got dick, wanna fuck?
Hold still, swallow this birth control pill, slut
Before I pump so much cum in your stomach that when I pull out
A year and a half old potty-trained baby falls out
And I ain't stayin to pay no child support
Are you playin? Be a man- bitch what you sayin?
You tryin to pull some bullshit, while I got one arm free
You want me to make this half-nelson a full?
[Hook]
[Royce]
Wattup boo, this is for you and your girlfriend
You bank-head, up in Detroit we Errol Flynn
Assholes that get guns and flash those
Never ever go to Detroit, we blast those
[Eminem]
Hi, my name is...
[Royce]
Royce
I'm the king
Gimme money, gimme jewels, everything
Ayyo, you with the long hair, is it yours?
I guess so, got a reciept- it's paid for
Got any more lipstick? I'm sick of red
Get a perm, you nappy head, you chicken head
I know you ghetto, I ain't trying to take the ghetto out
There's things about you to tell about, mellow out
I'm the one that be makin the clubs say "What"
Gettin love, and making the club say "What"
Some of you cats, hate on the low and got sick
Any sauce is not hits , it's not this
Yo
[Hook]

[Intro: Dr. Dre]
Yeah
Yo, let's bring it
[Hook: Eminem]
What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
Will you be as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
I said "What you gonna do when shit hits the fan?"
Are you gonna stand and fight like a man?
And show us you're as hard as you say you are?
Or you gonna run and go get your bodyguard?
[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
Niggas is so gangsta, Niggas is thugs
Niggas'll spend their whole life peddling drugs
Slanging dope in hopes of one day being able
To own their own label and give the game up
Some niggas came up, some just didn't
That's just the way it is, if it ain't meant it, it just isn't
Some niggas'll get money and pay niggas to back em
So they can act up, feel comfortable, and rap tough
And that's as backwards, cause them niggas just gone keep coming back
And that's when extortion happens
You struggle to get free, I know how this shit be
You deal with anything to live legitimately
But you gone find if you do get in this industry
It's best to be business with me than against me
Niggas get behind mics and ain't even emcees
Niggas get on MTV just to diss me
This shit don't even piss me off
I'm laughing all the way to the bank
Watching the satellite from ma Bentley
And you niggas don't even got a car
You're so far under my radar
I don't even know who the fuck you are
To tell you to suck my dick while I'm pissing
I don't even listen to your shit to know who the fuck I'm dissing
And media just feeds into these feuds
Trying to add fuel to the fire
This little nigga Ja Rule talking bout he's gonna slap me
Nigga please, you gotta jump and swing up to hit me in the knees
I laugh at these magazines when they interview him
All they doing is making fake threats to us through them
And pussy you're not Pac
, 
I knew him
Pac was a real nigga, you're just a fucking insult to em
It's too bad we had to fallout before he passed
If he could see this shit now, he'd be whooping your ass
You're talking to a pioneer who engineered this shit for 19 years
Who you got in your ear?
 
I don't even gotta say it, the fans know
Quit trying to be tough, nigga, you look like an asshole
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Obie Trice]
They say why don't we increase the peace
The only piece increased is that which deletes your peeps
Cause niggas run mouths but they don't run streets
Till that 45 will cease the speech
Yeah, it's a shame how the beef'll creep
Could've reached the peak, 
now you're left with a horrible leak
I'm trying to be as bleak with my speech as possible
Just in case a nigga trying to throw me an obstacle
Nigga, I'm not boxing you, I'm hospitable
I put you in a hospital, that's how I get at you
Let the doc op on you, he don't rid you?
You back on the streets, I send another hit at you
This is not a hypocritical issue
I will critical condition your tissue
Give a fuck if all ten of them with you
I throw an extra ten of them missiles
Turn gangstas into gentlemen, vicko
And ever since Eminem dissed you
I swear I see the woman and bitch in you
All this bickering back and forth over who signs who
Curtis pulled your skirt up, nigga, you got murdered
Now take it like a man and shake it off, damn!
And quit telling all these magazines your plans
How you gone slap up my mans, you're fictitious
Nigga, we'll send Stan to come murder your bitches
[Hook]
[Outro: Obie Trice]
Hahahahahaha
Yeah, yeah
Go out behind all the gangstas you want, nigga
Matter fact, go get every gangsta from every hood
In the United States of America to back you, nigga
Ain't nobody rap wit you
You can't see that?
You fell off, nigga
Hahahahahaha
Damn, damn
Shady slash Aftermath, motherfucker
2003 to infinity!
Yeah!

The national guard,
 
they scared of huntin' me
I love beef

A drug thief, bitch I'll take your marijuana
These slugs'll keep your ass away from my corner
I drown niggas in hundred degree saunas
You can act a fool if ya wanna (biatch!)
It's this lyrical piranha
Strapped wit a grenade, in the pool with ya mama
Attack her by the legs then I pull her to the bottom
Twist nuttin' up like a condom
Slap it if you fuckers got a problem
When I see 'em, you hoes ending up in a fucking mausoleum
Or hidden in the trunk of a black and gold

Pull in the garage while you screaming
Keep the motor on then I'm leaving

I'm a alcoholic, where's the fucking toilet?
Pass the hot dogs (Bizarre aren't you Islamic?)
Bitch, shut your fucking mouth
I'mma keep eating 'til Richard Simmons comes to my house
With a chain saw to cut me out (me out, me out!)
I'll fuck your wife, I had sex since I met her
Too busy fucking with your twelve year old baby sitter (hahaha)
And all women ain't shit - only good for cooking, cleaning
And sucking dick - and that's it! (I said it)
I'm responsible for killing John Candy
Got Jon Benet Ramsey in my '98 Camry
I don't give a fuck who you are
I'll shit on anybody; truly yours the idiotic Bizarre

My adolescent years weren't shit to what I do now
I never grew up, I was born grown and grew down
The older I get, the dumber the shit, I get in
The more ignorant, the incident is, I fit in
Ignoring the shit
 
how boring it gets
When there's no one to hit
I don't know when to quit throwing a fit
I know I'm a bit flaky but they make me
It's they who egged me and say they can take me
It's they who legs I brake and make achy
It's they who mistake me and make me so ANGRY!
(I'll shit on you!)
 
I'll spit on you
Start pissing and do the opposite on you
You weren't listening, I said
 
I'll cop a squat on you
Start spilling my guts like chicken cordon bleu and
Straight shit like Notorious B.I.G. did to that bitch
On his skit on his last album
Pull my pants downward and I'll-

Is Richard Pryor still alive?
If not I'm sicker than he was prior to him dying (what?)
Born brainless,

Bitch bring it,
 
these niggas that I hang with
I hang you up 
 by your ankles dangling (oww, oww)
My need I stay strangling, I don't need your help
If you don't give me the pussy
I'll un-loosen my belt
 
(I'll shit on you!)
I'm what your daddy's not, your mom's kinda cock
Your sister tends court, your aunt supply her rocks
Buck fifty cross your neck
Floss your teck, I'll beat you wit it across your chest
[Kuniva]
Yo, it's only right I jack your car keys and run
Spent all of my advancements on weed and guns
For fun, when I'm drunk
I'll run a truck through the weed house
Jump out and beat ya peeps down
 
worst than Steve Stout
Put you in chokeholds I learned last week
From the Police man who caught me stealing weed from his jeep
(hey, hey, hey!) 
I see hoes biting, y'all don't wanna brawl
That's like Deebo fighting Peabo Bryson
 
(I'll shit on you!)
Fuck what you hollering and yelling about
I'll reach in your mouth and pull your fucking skeleton out!
Niggas get hit wit a two piece; (

Once I get on two, hits of X
My disk slips and disconnects
'til I walk around this bitch with a twisted neck
But still shit on the first bitch who disrespects
(c'mon, I'll shit on you!)
 
Over reaction is my only reaction
Which only sets off a chain reaction
And puts five more zany acting maniacs in action
A rat pack in black jackets who pack ten
Nine millimeters, five criminals pulling heaters
And spilling liters of blood like swimming pools
Shiesty individuals shoot at bitches too
 
{*bullets spray*}
A lot of people say misogynistic which is true
I don't deny it matter of fact I stand by it
So please stand by it before we start up a damn riot
If you don't wanna get stampeded then stand quiet
Boy, girl, dog, woman, man, child
 (I'll shit on you!)
[Hook]
You heard me

[Proof]
It doesn't show, when I choke you with shotguns
Roll up on you with no guns and still pop one
I bomb like palm from your curb to your house
"Please God!" the last words from your mouth
No affiliates, just dawgs and jewels
Most flying death were smoging booze
All who choose to beef
I'll bring spatulas, flip it and throw it back at ya
So bring your gat with ya, spectacular
Murder manufacturer fuck immacular
Only the heathens talk when I try to get to flatten ya
Hop in an Acura, roll up on who got your back in a
Sliced them up then ya niggas start to act alive
I smoke brandish right off the treetops
Hang with real niggas PA's, PK's, and Pete Rock
Ya'll niggas in pre-op, spill blood on Reeboks
Don't discriminate blasted Wookies on the Ewok
Ya'll street forces survive just for excitement
Like if you was if you never heard of indictment
I sum it up quick so you can understand me
Fuck you, your crew, your bitch, and your whole family
[Proof talking]
Ya'll just for that, ya'll don't wanna fuck with you period
A whole bunch of motherfuckers are coming
This is just the beginning
You know what I'm saying, blow this shit sky wide
We want ya'll niggas; we wanna take over this rap industry
You know what I'm saying

[Verse 1]
These ideas are, nightmares to white parents
Whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings
Like whatever they say has no bearing
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing
To see him walking around with his headphones blaring
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care
He's a problem child,
 
and what bothers him all comes out
When he talks about, his fucking dad walking out
Cause he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out
His thoughts are wacked, he's mad so he's talking back
Talking black,
 
brainwashed from rock and rap
He sags his pants,
 
doo-rags and a stocking cap
His step-father hit him so he, socked him back
And broke his nose, his house is a broken home
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go
[Hook]
Sing with me, sing for the year (Sing it)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (Come on!)
Sing it with me, just for today
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away
[Verse 2]
Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun,
 
lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate
I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us,
 
plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?
From standing on corners and porches just rapping
To having a fortune, no more kissing ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly
But all their kids been listening to me religiously
So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B
It's all political, if my music is literal
Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl?
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to
You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
They say music can alter moods and talk to you
Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued
See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols
And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool
Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves
We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales
You ignoramus
 
but music is reflection of self
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing
To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long
Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives
So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die
'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe
We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone
Just let our spirits live on
Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can
[Hook x2]

Ohhh
Fat Joe
Hold ontop
Terry
Web Nitty
NEW JOE BUDDEN!!!
Lets go
Joey
Fuck with me for a minute
DJ On Point
50 Cent: And you know why his names on point, because he on point pussy
Verse 1
Now first thing's first motherfucker, I don't know you
And lets put it in the air get it clear that I don't owe you
Nobody wants to start of from scratch with they own Pro Tools
They'd rather blow you, bring you to places you don't go to
The bad guy, because I refuse to remain local, or beef with the people I say no too, cause I'm the focal
I don't deal with you dudes who seem to think that I got my deal out the blue
Four years ago shit I was feelin' like you
With five bucks to my name, rips and tears in my shoes
Borrowin' outfits, no food starvin' that's mouse shit
But now that mouse on, nigga's act like the kitchen oven, didn't used to keep the whole house warm, I was without ohh
I ain't accept my flaws, beggin' the dealer for a hit, like please just accept my shorts
Nothin' mine except for my draws,
 they pegged me a loss, misguided, kid hopeless, they misquoted motherfuckers
Hook:
Sing with me, sing for the year
Sing for the laughter and sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it's just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good Lord will take you away
And A ohh ohh ohh
Walk with me
Verse 2:
The white folk, see my truck, start reactin' liking, get surprised, when yeah its a black kid driving
Thumbs up, now they start yakin, vibrant, asking me how'ss the traction they was interested in buyin'
Hood see me in it, say I don't deserve it, I'm not worth it, shouldn't have it, they should jack it
They think I'm flossing, with the windows down starin' at folks, you motherfucker, Joey sharin' the hope
And why in the mall, they eyein me for, like I stole items before, tah, nigga I could buy this store
And why when I'm walkin in the bank, tryin to get my good house and my mortgage and they think that I'm fraudulent
Think I can't afford it when the pores of my skin are dark and I'm a young buck, they think I got young bucks
Dumb fucks, so ignorant, think I only came to run muck, make me wanna resort to my ways somewhat
They say you soft when you move out the hood, so my goal is to make all of my loved ones punks
My pop, my mother, my son, his mother, my girl, my brother my entire squad, we'll be soft from afar
Haters wanna shoot me and graise me blocka
Caused I'm from the hood, but my mumma raised me proper
And if you hate Joey then you hatin the best
You hate yourself, you hate growth, hate success
Thinking of the hands on in the hallway cyphers
And I thank God, he knows he wasn't always like this
It gets better the more he guides us
You can tell cause the haters didn't always dislike us
Dj on point Joe Budden the worst of Joe budden
Hook 2
Is this what you want
Verse 3:
Joey offerin' substance
Without a mood or mind altering substance
That no longer alters my substance
I'm thankful for every single fan that I get
And just think, years ago, shit I was planning to quit
But nah, I'll keep troopin' it, for y'all at tripple dub Joebudden.com that type "Joey keep doin' it"
Yall who though we wouldn't see shine in Jerz, for the kids that idolize me, just cause I can rhyme words
For y'all struggling, I know its hard getting by
For dude that said Calm Down, helped him stop getting high
For the gangstas, hustlers, mobsters that move weight
For dudes that followed Jumpoff from the first Clue tape
For all the credit that I'm not used ta, for the people saying I'm the future, thank you
Y'all help a nigga make it through the fake shit, even do it for the haters, you too can make it
For my niggas on the corner, giving me pounds and shit, for all the teachers said Joey wouldn't amount to shit
My mommy at my video shoot, she crying and all, for little man with the marker saying sign my ball
For all my true fans, all the people that support me, the people that adore me, when they could have ignored me
Thinking of Lincoln High, in the hallway cyphers, and I thank God, he knows it wasn't always like this

Yeah, I'm tryin to catch me somethin
A little jux or somethin
[Hook: 50 Cent]
Nigga that watch is nice, that's what you bought for me?
That chain is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Them earrings is nice, that's what you bought for me?
Take that shit off, move I'll break you off properly
[Verse One]
You wan' spray at me go 'head; the last nigga that tried
Got hit, keeled over, and bled 'til he died
Your lil' sister callin me stupid, reason why
Her and your momma in the living room now hogtied
I came up with two new ways to get rich, I can't wait
Got a brand new cig in that ol' 38
I be schemin to put a lil' bread on my plate
Watch and dress shirts, stomp through a hole in the cake
I stick a nigga for his shine, sell him back the next day
You thought I really want it you pussy? Bitch please
This is stashhouse, jackpot, there go them ki's
My black G-Unit hoodie just wreak with marijuana
Cocaine comin out my pores in the sauna
I'm serious man, I'm so sincere
This the flow right here that fucked up Jeffrey's career
Make money, take money, yeah nigga, YEAH
[Hook]
[Interlude: 50 Cent]
I get mine the fast way, the ski mask way
Make money, make money money money
Nigga if you ask me, this the only way
Take money, take money money money
[Verse Two]
Who's that peepin in my window?
WOW - the feds on me now
They know when I'm sleepin, they know when I'm wake
I know they got my phone tapped, I'm screamin fuck Jake
I'm tryin to stay out them pens, so I switched states
Bad News, VA - now that sounds great
I see niggas with that ice on, rims shined up
This town's one big pussy, waitin to get fucked
I holla at A.I. peoples to get gats
They charge me 500 apiece for two macs
Then I'm back doin me, back out on the spree
Catch me and niggas slippin out pumpin that D
Get me a little crew I'll have 'em pumpin for me
The more product I take the more paper we see
Change my name, in NY they don't know where I be
Yeah a nigga doin dirt, but a nigga low-key
[Hook]

"I see a lot of people who appear to be fucking wasted – how many people here are fucking wasted?
 
And how many people are here are just fucked up mentally?" calls Eminem, introducing My Name Is, the anthem of every angry adolescent on the planet.
It's met with a feral roar from his army of fans, adorned in a uniform of Parental Advisory T-shirts, foam middle fingers or V For Vendetta masks.
You can see why this crowd of largely febrile young men welcome him back to the stage like an army of internet trolls blessed by the presence of their maker
: 
Eminem is the first rapper to headline Wembley Stadium – and yet by his own admission, he's only here because Hyde Park deemed his lyrical content too offensive
.
For music's perennial delinquent – now aged 41 – tonight is the first of two shows at the 90,000 capacity venue, and is the first time the Detroit artist has played the city since 2001
 – 
a set that was then threatened by gay and women's rights protesters before the rapper sparked further controversy with the performance itself, as he took the stage replete with chainsaw, Friday the 13th hockey mask and, perhaps the most cardinal sin of all, wearing nothing but a pair of loosely fitting denim dungarees.
This time, however, the goal is to establish himself as one of music's most iconic artists, rather than shock the masses
.
In those 13 years Eminem has encountered all manner of wrinkle inducing incidents – family lawsuits, overdoses and subsequent stints in rehabilitation and now sobriety – but he still cuts a striking figure.
 
His arms are big but his face is thin and remains hidden by a black cap throughout the show, with his bleached blond hair barely visible.
He rattles through the first half of the set as if reacquainting himself with the stage, and it's not until he brings on surprise guest Dr Dre halfway through the show for Next Episode, Still Dre, G Thang and Forgot About Dre, that Eminem's ambitions become fully realised - even if Dre's voice is a much more almighty force than his apprentice's.
Despite his budget stretching to snag the richest rapper of all time, unfortunately there was no sign of Dido for Stan tonight, her part as an ill-fated pregnant girlfriend instead played by a glamorous backing vocalist in a leotard.
Some of Eminem's vision is executed brilliantly – after all, he's been making stadium rap albums since 2002. Tracks like Survival befit its location with its poodle perm guitars, and the Beastie Boys-indebted Berzerk sounds incredible live. Sing for the Moment and Toy Soldiers are huge crowd-pleasers, but then they were always built for arenas – to fill them, maybe, but not necessarily satisfy.
When it works, Eminem's music fills the space with a dark, rumbling magic – The Way I Am and his medley of My Name Is, Real Slim Shady and Without Me hits the balance of huge and yet intimately evil – but the flat points during the show come from a lack of menace, of spite, that same sinisterness that first gained him his loyal tribe, and made him so exciting.
• This article was amended on 12 July to correct a song title from Sing It to Sing for the Moment.

[Verse One: Eminem]
I'm a pacifist, unless there's ass to kick
It'll be tragic miss, If I don't fuck you bitch
You can take the dick you little cunt
Lick it than pass it like a blunt
But I'm sober now I'm done with drugs
That was the last chapter this is the next one
My place in the game is big, son
I'm somewhere between God, Godzilla, and King Kong
A Monster, yeah like his dick is
They say I'm hung like a bear, so run, run bitches
The chainsaw can give you staple stitches
If your unfaithful, just kill your wife than rape your mistress
And if that don't work your a fucking retard
I'm sick of playing games, I'm here for revenge, Dee Barnes
Slapping up Dre for what he start-
Ed, long time ago and it left him scarred
[Hook: Eminem] x2
Everybody knows I'm crazy
This game isn't gonna change me
There's nothing else to say, see
You already know I'm Shady
[Verse Two: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)]
I'm assuming you don't want to battle
That will be your dying day
Into your house bullets will rattle
You just cannot win this fray
Don't believe me ask Ray (Cornrows)
(I heard he thinks he's gangsta), but he's really not though
(so don't fuck with Slim), that's the goal
(he'll burn your house down), and relocate you to the motorhomes
Holdin' pullin' moldin' chrome
Oldest, dopest, grossest flow
Killer, 
father
, loving home
Family jealous of all this gold
Everybody wants a million from Shady
Even the goddamn motherfuckers who hate me
But I stays crazy, and sprayz AKs at babys
Me and Drezy
 (Yeah Slim your Shady)
[Hook 2: Eminem & (Dr. Dre)] x2
Mothefucker I told you I was (crazy)
The game done helped (shape me)
The only thing left to (say b)
Is hey (Slim your Shady)
[Outro: Eminem]
Relapse 2 mothafuckas
Fuck you and your mothas
Dre grab the gat *gunshots*

[Intro: Eminem]
Guess who
, 
New shit!
D12 World
, 
D-Twizzy!
[Hook: Eminem]
You don't got a reason to want no beef
You ain't got no ends to justify the means
You don't got a cause, you better put it on pause
You don't got the balls to fit in them draws
So whatever it is you thinking that's got you gassed
You better start rethinking and thinking it fast
Ain't nobody told you, homie, ya wanna ask
You better put them brakes and let off the gas
And Slow Your Roll
[Swift]
Sinister, a menace to many, I'm not friendly you
Get shot in a Kennedy fashion
Pop willingly 
you walking around with Pac's identity
I'm a mockery you bout to watch what its fin to be
I'm not mentally focused but lyrically we got it locked
And its not about dropping albums, I'll sock a nigga on the spot
You can't help it but to imagine this walking massacre
A madman strapped with a magnum blow that spasm out ya back
And just stand there and snatch your medallion
See I can't fear any nigga that can not happen
The immaculate Mack handler
That got this wrapping by the back of his neck
A scavenger I'm a threat then you feel me
Like a hand full of syringes
I'm ill enough to scream at your front do', blow it off the hinges
I'm marksmatic to press marksman outta walking
Cause soon your body can catch me shooting up your coffin
So don't provoke shit, I wish the whole
Mankind was a neck so I can choke it
Ferocious and you ain't gonna be knowing where ya folks is
Fuck the milk cartons and posters its over, they ghosts
[Proof]
Niggas is bitch instead of digging a ditch
I'mma see how filled this river can get even bitches get hit
I'm all dog on all fours barking with long claws
Just fight for the wrong cause your boss with thong drawers
You ain't in my bracket bitch following faggots
With wanksta tats on their ass
[Eminem:] Magic Stick If I get hit once you get hit twice [backwards]
These scrubs need to do what he love and just play the back
Before I'll Put A Sword On Ya Head Like A Raider Cap
You bust I'm spraying back, leave your hood laying flat
Now what you gonna say to that?
[Hook]
[Bizarre]
Pull up new county truck, throw up, blow up, beat a handicap bitch up
Fuck butter I killed the DJ
I don't need you, bitch, I got a instant replay
Lay down bitch get butt naked
And fuck the viagra I'm trying to nut in two seconds
All around the world, fuck wit different cliques
You ain't got no weed get the fuck out my room bitch
[Kuniva]
I'm calm but I steal on niggas like I was clepto
Put that chrome shit to ya head like you was Destro
Why stop niggas, why not pop niggas, we cop figures
Keep them toast like I hop nigga, we breathe dirt so be alert
Or get them guns on ya chest like a welcome to the hood T-shirt
Let's go back before throw backs, before I dro sacks
I used to blow gats, bullets'll find you like a low jack
I'm hopeless, a ferocious dosage of dope shit
A culprit of culture a chaotic commotion
Kuniva will blow shit off the map I post it
Knock you out of your penny loafers, fuck that ho shit
[Hook]
[Kon Artis]
I point my fingers to the ground, throw my waist to left of me
To knuckle should ship like a Em upside down and you best be
On your p's and q's people we sees to use
No one see's your views, so now you see's exclusives
And put it in your little magazine, but you should
Know that was the most desperate thing that you could
Pull out of your crotch you faggots all owe us much
Start doing heroin lines for as much as you gossip
Like bitches with Oscars, yall actresses
45's make bodies flip like flabby tits
Bullets coming at your doom like a buck up 6th
Now what the fuck you gonna do to get up out of this shit?
Your record was released 17 years ago you dumb bitch
Do the math, you'll never have a Shady/Aftermath Runyon Ave
Kind of staff to back that ass up so back that ass up
Before we clap that ass up
[Hook: Eminem]
[Outro: Kon Artis]
Nigga you better ask somebody
These niggas think they can just put shit
Out on their own, Fuck them

Konvict

Upfront
Akon, Slim Shady

[Hook : Akon] x2
I feel you creepin', I can see you from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo

Tae Bo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh
[Akon]
Upfront style ready to attack now
Pull in the parking lot slow with the 'lac down
Convicts got the whole thing packed now
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!
I feel it down and cracked now (ooh)
I see it dull and backed now
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!
[Hook] x2
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my
 
Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
Smack that all on the floor
Smack that give me some more
Smack that 'till you get sore
Smack that oh-oooh
[Eminem]
Ooh, looks like another club banger
They better hang on when they throw this thing on
Get a lil' drink on, They gonna flip for this Akon shit
You can bank on it
Pedicure, manicure kitty-cat claws
The way she climbs up and down them poles
Looking like one of them 
Putty-Cat Dolls
Tryin' to hold my woodie back through my draws
Steps upstage didn't think I saw
Creeps up behind me, shes like "YOU'RE -"
I'm like ya I know
 
lets cut to the chase
No time to waste back to my place
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away
Or more like a palace
, 
shall I say
Plus I got pal if your gal is game
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playin', Akon
[Hook : Akon] x2
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me
[Akon]
Eminem is rollin', d and 'em rollin' bo
And all marvelous them rolling
Women just hoeing, big booty rollin'
Soon I'll be all in them and throwing "D"
Hitting no less than "Three"
Block wheel

Girl I can tell you want me because lately
[Hook] x2

[Skylar]
 
What do you want from me Roger?
[Roger]
 
I know it was you all along messing around with my dear Veronica!
[Skylar]
 
Wait a minute, you hold it right there
Me and that woman love each other
[Roger] 
Love!?
What do you know of love?
[Skylar] We were destined to be together
I met her on the beach!
[Roger] 
Are you out to destroy me?
[Skylar] 
No Roger. That's not what I want to do
I love her! And we're going to be together
[Roger] 
Never!

Yeah!
God damn!
Feels like a long time don't it?
Did you miss us?
We missed you!
Shady Narcotics
It's the Re-Up!
Pussies
And we're back
Myself

D12
 [gunshot]
50 Cent
 [gunshot]
Obie Trice
 [gunshot]
Stat Quo
 [gunshot]
And I would also like to introduce
The two newest members of the family
One goes by the name of Bobby Creek
 [gunshot]
The other goes by the name of Ca$his
 [gunshot], 
from Orange County
And I think it's about time we cut the bullshit
Let's go...

[Intro]
I own a mansion, but live in a house
A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
I'm Mr. Brightside, glass is half-full
But my tank's half empty, gasket just blew
[Verse 1]
This always happens
30 minutes from home, gotta lay a log cabin, only option I have's McDonalds's bathroom
In a public stall dropping a football, so every time someone walks in the John I get maddened
"Shady, what up?" What? Come on, man, I'm crappin'
And you're asking for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?
Oh that's odd, I just happened
To run out of tissue,
 
yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
"Thanks dawg, name's Todd, a big fan"
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
Told him
 
"Todd, you're the shit";
 
when's all of this crap end?
Can't pump my gas without causing an accident
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fucking trash
Without someone passing through my sub harassing
I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
I'd rather wallow than bask suffering succotash,
 
but the ant-
Acid, it gives my stomach gas
When I mix my corn with my fucking mashed
Potatoes, so what, ho kiss my country bumpkin ass
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper,
 
Tupperware in the cupboard, plastic ware up the ass
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that
B-Boy to the core,
 
mule, I'm as stubborn as
[Hook]
Maybe that's why I feel so strange
Got it all, but I still won't change
Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
It's the motivation that keeps me going
This is the inspiration I need
I can never turn my back on a city that made me and
(Life's been good to me so far)
[Verse 2]
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that,
 
don't know what the fuck I'd be doing if it weren't rap
Probably be a giant turd sack
But I blew, never turned back
Turned 40 and still sag,
 
teenagers act more fucking mature, Jack
Fuck you gonna say to me?
 
I leave on my own terms ass-
Hole, I'm going berzerk,
 
my nerves are bad
But I love the perks my work has
I get to meet famous people, look at her
 
dag
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged,
 
and I heard she drag-races
, 
*burp* swag
Tuck in my Hanes shirt tag
You're Danica Patrick
 
(yeah) word, skag
We'd be the perfect match, cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
My apologies, no disrespect to technology, but what the heck is all of these buttons, you expect me to sit here and learn that?
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda,
 
be an expert at
Computers?
 
I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica,
 
Hell with
Playstation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda
Nintendo, bitch! Run, jump, punch, stab
 
and I melt the
Mozzarella on my spaghetti,
 
put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's
And belch
They say this spray butter is bad for my health
 
but
I think this poor white trash from the trailer
Jed Clampett,
 
Fred Sanford and welfare mentality helps ta
Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
Managed to dwell within these parameters,
 
still crammin' the shelves full of Hamburger Helper
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt a
Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
With all these pet peeves,
 
goddammit to hell, I
Can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell the
Other day someone got all elaborate and stuck a head from a fucking dead cat in my mailbox
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
I think my karma is catching up with me
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Got friends on Facebook, all over the world
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked
[Verse 3]
I'm trying to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me
In produce, hunched over, giant nosebleed
Ogre style as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
 
by the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
Embarrassed,
 
I just did Comerica with Hova,
 
show's over, I'm hiding in Kroger buying groceries
He just had front row seats, told me to sign this poster, then insults me
"Wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet"
I'm at a crossroad, lost, still shopping at Costco's
Sloppy Joe's, bulk waffles
Got caught picking my nose (agh!), look over see these two hot hoes
Finger still up one of my nostrils
Right next to 'em stuck at the light, the fucking shit's
Taking forever to change,
 
it's stuck, these bitches are loving it
Rubbing it in, chuckling
Couldn't do nothing, play it off
"What you bumping?" "Trunk Muzik, Yelawolf's better", fucking bitch
They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
The pressure, they want me to follow up with a-
Nother one after Recovery was so highly coveted
But what good is a fucking recovery if I fumble it?
Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
 
hopping out shrubbery on you sons of bitches
Wrong subdivision
To fuck with, bitch,
 
quit snappin' fucking pictures of my kids, I love my city
But you pushed me to the limit, what a pity
The shit I complain about
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
Kool-Aid stain on the couch, I'll never get it out
But bitch, I got an elevator in my house,
 
ants and a mouse
I'm living the dream
[Hook]

I'm a soldier
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Never was a thug, just infatuated with guns
Never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one
And got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin'
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin'
Willin' to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant life or death
Never live to regret what I said
When you're me,
 
people just want to see
If it's true, if it's you, what you say in your rap's, what you do
So they feel, as part of your obligation to fulfill
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel you're in violation
Any hesitation'll get you killed
, 
if you feel it, kill it
If you conceal it, reveal it
, 
being reasonable will leave you full of bullets
Pull it, squeeze it, till it's empty
, 
tempt me, push me, pussies
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze
[Hook]
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never slip or stumble
I'm a soldier, these shoulders hold up so much
They won't budge, I'll never fall or fold up
I'm a soldier, even if my collar bone's crush or crumble
I will never stumble
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I love pissin' you off, it gets me off
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin' judge lets me off
All you mothafuckers gotta do is set me off
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin' bets be off
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch, it's news
Pistol whippin' motherfuckin' bouncer 6'2"
Who needs bullets, soon as I pull it, you sweat bullets
An excellent method to get rid of the next bully
It's actually better cause instead you murderin'
You can hurt 'em and come back again and kick dirt at 'em
It's like pourin' salt in the wounds, assault and get sued
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops
All you see is bitches comin' out their halter tops
Running and ducking out the Hot Rocks parking lot
You'll all get shot whether its your fault or not
Cause
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin' to 'em
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of Pac influence
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin' to it
You mothafuckers could never do it like I could do it
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it
Don't ever in your life, try to knock the truest
I spit the illest shit ever
, been dropped in 
two inch
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on the cock
Listen to the sound of me spillin' my heart through this pen
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again
Full of controversy until
 
I retire my jersey
Till the fire inside dies and expires at thirty
And lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity
[Hook]
Yo' left, yo' left, yo' left
Right, left

[2Pac]
So what I'm gonna do, hopefully, is, I wanna be..
I-I not i wanna be, I am, 2Pac
, 
2pac (2005!)
{*vocal scratch: "guess who's back" - 4X*}
[2Pac] (4X)
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Posse deep as I roll through the streets
Motherfuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Layin' so low you'd think I'm asleep
But at the slightest beef I'm robbin' niggas of they teeth
And 
OPD
 can get the dick if they play toughy
Last time them niggas rushed me I ain't bust but now I'm touched
Trust me, ain't nuttin' jumpin' but these buckshots
A nigga's got enough knocks, I'm poppin' at corrupt cops {*pow*}
Them motherfuckers catch a hot one
You wanted to start a problem now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold ya
Motherfucking soldier; ready to roll and take control
So now I jack 'em while they sleepin'
Roll to the door, throw a grenade in the precinct
 {*pin, explosion*}
Some people panic, brothers bugged out
I had to keep poppin' cause there's no stoppin' 'til they rubbed out
And they vest don't protect from the head wounds
Reload ammunitions and them bitches will be dead soon
 {*boom*}
Smoke risin' from the barrel of my shotty
I finally got revenge now count the bodies
Twenty cops, one for every year in jail
Tryin' to keep a nigga down but you failed
Before I let you take me, I told ya
Fuck bein' trapped, I'm a soldier
[Hook: Eminem]
I betcha that I got something you ain't got, that's called courage
It don't come from no liquor bottle, it ain't scotch, it's not bourbon
I don't walk around like no G cause that ain't me, I'm not that person
I don't try to act like you do cause that ain't you, you just frontin', you ain't?
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
2Pac and the mad bitch
In the six-fo' rag on them thangs, that's a bad bitch
Gettin' ghost on them bitches in the town
Bustin' out the back seat nigga when we clown
Homey is you down? Dee got the strap and she anxious {*click*}
Hurry up 'fore she spank shit {*tires peeling*}
Comin' 'round the corner spittin' rounds, they can't hold me down
Caught them 
sucker
-ass bitches outta bounds
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day
Now tell me how that sound, a double date laced with hate
Make 'em pray for the judgment day - stinkin' beotch!
[Hook]
[2Pac] 2Pac
[2Pac] (4X)
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

Kick a 
hypest
 lyric every time I run upon a track
You know I'm not wack
You have to step back
Cause if you don't I'll prove that I'm the mac
Every time I kick a lyric tune it to 2 95
Yo do you find me live?
If you don't then that's alright cause I'll just grab the microphone
And I just got to get so hype when I speak in a hyper tone
There's so many styles I might get thrown
And here's a place where I like to roam
And all the girls that I like to bone
Have the big butts, no they don't
Cause I don't like that nigga shit
I'm just here to make a bigga hit
When I be kickin' the hypest dopest rhymes
Just say that M&M is the best MC in of all times

Eminem has rapped about every horrendous thing. Rape, Kurt Cobain's suicide, shooting up a school, plane crashes, molesting children, homophobia, and killing his wife....
But is still afraid to say the N word just once. 
Lmao

[Intro]
You fucking groupie
Pick up the goddamn phone
[Verse 1]
Bitch, where the fuck were you Tuesday?
 
With who you say?
I wasn't at the studio, bitch,
 
what'cha do? Screw Dre?
You went there looking for me?
 
Boo, that excuse is too lame
Keep playing me you're gonna end up with a huge goose egg
You fake, lying slut you never told me you knew Drake
And Lupe? You want to lose two legs?
You trying to flip this on me? If I spent more time with you,
 
you say
"Okay, yeah and I'm coo-coo, ay?"
Well, screw you, and I'll be the third person who screwed you today
Oh, fourth - Dre, Drake, Lupe -- oohm touché
You were too two-faced for me,
 
thought you was my number one,
 
true-blue ace
But you ain't
And I can't see you when you make that wittle boo-boo face
Cause I'm hanging up this phone, boo
You make my fucking blue tooth ache
You're feeling blue? Too late
Go smurf yourself,
 
you make me wanna smurf and puke blue Kool Aid
Here's what you say to someone you hate
[Hook]
My life would be so much better if you'd just drop dead
I was laying in bed last night thinking and this thought just popped in my head
And I thought, wouldn't shit just be a lot easier if you dropped dead
I would feel so much better
[Verse 2]
Think I just relapsed, this bitch pushed me over the brink
Hop on the freeway trying to get some time alone and just think
'Til the cops pulled me over, but they let me go
 
cause I told 'em I'm only driving drunk, cause that bitch drove me to drink
I'm back on my fuck hoes,
 
with a whole new hatred for blondes
But bias?
 
I hate all bitches the same,
 
baby come on
Excuse the pun, but bitch is such a broad statement,
 
and I'm
Channeling my anger through every single station that's on
Cause a woman broke my he-art, I say he-art
Cause she ripped it in two pa-arts,
 
and threw it in the garbage
Who do you think you a-are, bitch?
Guess it's time for me to get the dust off and pick myself up off the carpet
But I'll never say the L-word again
I Lo-Lo-Lo-Lo... lesbian
Aaahhh, I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
My life'd be so much better if you just
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Cause you told me, you'd love me, forever, bitch, that was a lie
Now I never, wanted someone, to die, so bad in my fucking life
But fuck it,
 
there’s other fish in the sea
[Verse 3]
And I'mma have a whale of a time
 
being a single sailor
For the night,
 
bitch on a scale of
1 to 10,
 
shit, I must be the holy grail of
Catches
 
ho, I got an Oscar attached to my fucking name (De La)
I might hit the club, find a chick that's tailor
Made for me,
 
say fuck it, kick some shots back, get hammered and nail her
These bitches trying to get attached, but they're failing to latch onto the tail of
My bumper they're scratching at the back of my trailer
Like I'm itching to get hitched
Yeah, I'm rich as a bitch
But bitches ain't shit,
 
I'd rather leave a bitch in a ditch
Bitch you complain when you listen to this
But you still throw yourself at me,
 
that's what I call pitchin' a bitch
That's why I'm swinging at this chicks on-site
Long as I got a bat and two balls it's foul,
 
but my dick's on strike
So all that love shit is null and void,
 
bitch I'm a droid
I avoid Cupid, stupid
 
wasn't for blow jobs, you'd be unemployed
Oye-yoy-yoy, man oh man,
 
your boy-boy-boy's
 
getting sick of these girls-girls-girls,
 
oink-oink-oink
You fuckin' pigs, all you're good for is doink-doink-doink
I got 99 problems and a bitch ain't one
She's all 99 of 'em; I need a machine gun
I'll take 'em all out, I hope you hear this song and go into a cardiac arrest
Have a heart attack and just
Drop dead
 
and I'mma throw a fucking party after this
Cause yes
[Hook]
[Outro]
I'm just playing bitch, you know I love you

Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like...
[Verse]
Posse
 
deep
 as I 
roll through the streets
Mother-fuck the police as we creep in our Jeeps
Laying so low you would think I'm asleep
But at the slightest creep
I'm robbing niggas to their teeth
 (move it up)
And OPD can get a dick if they don't play toughy
That's why those niggas rush me
I ain't bust but now I'm touchy
Trust me
And I ain't joking about these buck shots
Those niggas got enough nots
For popping at corrupt cops
So you mother fuckers want a hot one
You wanted to started a problem
But now you coward cops have got one
And there's no prison that can hold you
Mother fucking soldier
Ready to roll and take control
So now I jack them while they are sleeping
Roll to the door and throw a grenade in the precinct
Some people panic and 
brothers bugged out
I had to keep popping because there was no stopping
Until I got some out
And invest no protect from the head wounds
Even armed with ammunition the bitches will be dead soon
Smoke rising from the barrel of my shot
I finally got revenge that helped the block
Twenty cops
One for every year in jail
Trying to keep a nigga down but you failed
And before I let you take me I told you
Fuck being trapped because I'm a soldier
[Outro]
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier, a soldier
Everywhere I see, a soldier like me

[Verse 1]
We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn’t much
But it’s enough to make me wonder what’s in store for us,
 
it’s lust
It’s torturous,
 
you must be a sorceress cause' you just
Did the impossible: gained my trust,
 
don’t play games it’ll be dangerous
If you fuck me over,
 
cause if I get burnt, I'mma show you
What it’s like to hurt
 
cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil, spell it backwards I’ll show ya
Nobody knows me, I’m cold, walk down this road all alone
It’s no one’s fault but my own, it’s the path I’ve chosen to go
Frozen in snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don’t ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Blood suckin’ succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?
I’ve tried in this department, but I ain’t had no luck with this
It sucks, but it’s exactly what I thought it would be like tryna start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kinda emotional roller coaster
Something I won’t go on so you toy with my emotions, ho it’s over
It’s like an explosion everytime I hold ya, I wasn’t joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you’re a supernova, and I'm a...
[Hook]
I’m a space bound rocketship and your hearts the moon
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you, right at you
[Verse 2]
I’ll do whatever it takes, when I’m with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain’t with you, I have zero strength
There’s no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we thinks
Gonna be that one, 
then once we get them it’s never the same
You want them when they don’t want you, soon as they do feelings change
It’s not a contest and I ain’t on no conquest for no mate
I wasn’t looking when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take? 
Let’s cut to the chase
'fore the door shuts in your face
, 
promise me if I cave in and break
And leave myself open
 
that I won’t be making a mistake
, cause I'm a
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
So after a year and six months, it’s no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I’m pleading, I’m tryna stop you from leaving
You won’t even listen so fuck it, I’m tryna stop you from breathing
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezing
'til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain’t no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple I told you this
[Bridge]
And I would've did anything for you, to show you how much I adored you
But it’s over now, it’s too late to save our love
Just promise me you’ll think of me every time
You look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a
[Outro]
I’m a space bound rocketship and your hearts the moon
And I’m aiming right at you, right at you
Two hundred fifty thousand miles on a clear night in June
And I’m so lost without you, without you, without you

[Intro: Eminem]
If there's any bitches in this room
Then there's something I gotta say
For all the fools, who fell for the first
Girl who comes their way
I've been down that road and, now I'm back
Sitting on square one
Tryna pick myself up where I started from
[
]
I never would have thought that I'd see you out of control
Even though, my penis was deep down in your hole
You should know between us we was like mates of soul
Nothing could intervene us, especially no hoes
You was more so the chalant type I chose to more shows
Haunted you nights I suppose
, that's how it go
With time spent, emotion grows
In the beginning friends, we decided to roll
So who's responsible when you get excited, explode
And Obie's grinning, then you invite that Obie's cold
But bitches they gon' talk, niggas they gon' hate
We established this way before we became mates
So what's required is that you chill with all that fire
Get your desire when I retire, and
[Hook: Eminem]
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
I, never thought I'd find, someone to be mine
Lord knows I was right, cause you just crossed the line
"Spend some time with me, say that you'll be mine"
[Eminem]
I used to say I never met a girl like you before
Still ain't got a fucking clue as to who you truly are
Almost went as far as introducing you to my daughters
'til you went as far as going and snooping through my drawers
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on
You started getting moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me
And whoulda even knew that, who woulda even thought possibly
Cupid could shoot another one of them goddamn darts at me
It's true that I got shot in the heart
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and
Reach up under the seat as your heart starts to beat
Before you make a decision that's life altering
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring
[Hook]
[
]
Ha ha, yeah right bitch
Spend some time with my dick
In most cases - Stat's attitude is "fuck a bitch"
My only motive is to get head and fuck a bitch
But you was diff-er-ent, thought we shared a covenant
Even held your hand in pub-a-lic
, 
we suffering because of this
Shorty on some whole 'nother other shit
Trying to play slick, thinking I'mma trick off grip
I'll admit, I was caught in the mix, down to commit
Feeding you the best of me
, 
I shoulda fed you piss
We started off closer than close, but who coulda predicted to know
Your trifling ways woulda stopped our growth
And the final result, back in that same boat
I asked myself, do I love these hoes? NOPE!
[50 
]
Em introduced, 50 this is Tanya, Tanya this is 50
Then slid off and left her to kick it with me
I complimented her, I said you have very nice lips
With my imagination, I could see her sucking my dick
We played the phone game a week later, shit changed fast
Had her coming over in a cab to give me some ass
Downtown Manhattan on the balcony, stare at the skyline
Penthouse full of imported shit, you know how I grind
She got to talking, talking like a opportunist do
Why talk when sucking my dick is the real career move
Said she's an inspiring actress, she do videos for practice
Yeah yeah, know how many times I done heard that shit?
[Hook]

[Intro]
People!! It feels so good to be back
Ladies and gentleman
, 
introducing the new and improved you know who
[Verse 1]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push,
 
no friend of Bush
I'm the centerpiece,
 
you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash,
 
all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now,
 
I've come to release this info
So I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
Canibitch don't want no beef with Slim, nooooo!
Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
From seance to seance
Aw-a-aw-ch-a-aw
[Hook]
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now
We gon' have a good time
Don't be scared, cause there ain't nothing to worry about
Let your hair down
And square dance with me!
[Verse 2]
Yeah, let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back
Boo! The boogie monster of rap, yeah the man's back
With a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face and push this generation
Of kids to stand and fight for the right to say something you might not like
This white hot light that I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no, 
I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no, I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do,
 oh, yo, ho, hello there
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to the Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your mothafucking ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinking that crap can't happen
Till you fuck around, get an 
Anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran wrap wrappin'
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin'
Fucking assassins
 
hi-jackin' Amtrak's, crashin'
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin'
To join the army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby getting recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eating their food and their baked beans
I'm 28, they gonna take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still Inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, 
hang me
!
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Nothing moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothing soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothing boosts me more or suits me beautifully
There's nothing you can do to me, stab me, shoot me
Psychotic, hypnotic, product I got the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk a lot of hem-de-lay-la-la-la
Oochie walla walla um da dah da dah da
 
but you gotta gotta
Keep moving, there's more music to make
Keep making new shit, produce hits to break
The monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock and Hennessey
, 
thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees
, 
Got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hungry like a fucking younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny
I have the money to have you killed by somebody who has nothin'
I'm past bluffing
Pass the
 
K-Y,
 
let's get ready for some intense serious ass fucking!
[Hook]
[Outro]
Dr. Dre
 
wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas wants to square dance with me
X to the Z
 
wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes
 
wants to square dance with me
Can-a-bitch won't square dance with me
Fan-a-bitch
 
won't square dance with me
Canada-bis
 don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen
 
wants to square dance with you
Yeeehawww!

[Hook: Dido]
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all
And even if I could it'll all be gray but your picture on my wall
It reminds me, that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
[Verse 1]
Dear Slim,
 
I wrote you but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man,
 
how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her?
I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too,
 
that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan,
 
this is Stan
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote; I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to, but you could've signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you
For four hours and you just said no
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my Mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. We should be together too
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it ?
I know you got my last two letters
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you
And you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out
[Hook]
[Verse 4]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother
I wrote it on a
 
Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clowning dog, come on, how fucked up is you
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad
Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk
And she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you, damn

In a recent sit-down with MTV News’ Tim Kash, 50 laughed off recent rumors that Em — who has all but disappeared from the public eye in recent years — has been packing on the pounds, and that as a result of his weight gain, has become a recluse, venturing out of his Detroit-area mansion only to gorge himself on meals from Taco Bell and Outback Steakhouse.
 
The G-Unit captain insisted that fans are going to be seeing a slim-and-trim Eminem real soon.
“Em is in shape right now. He looks good. I seen him in Detroit. He’s gonna look real good when you see him return,” Fif laughed. “He’s in shape right now.”
The rapper has been on hiatus ever since releasing his official Shady Records mixtape, Eminem Presents the Re-Up, in December of 2006. In mid-2007, he called in to Angie Martinez’s show on New York radio station Hot 97 to say he was “in limbo” and “debating” whether to release another album .
 
Then, in January of this year, news broke that he had been rushed to a Detroit-area hospital for complications related to pneumonia , and in at least one of those reports, sources were quoted as saying his weight had exceeded 200 lbs.
Those rumors — coupled with a National Enquirer story that quoted an “insider” as saying that the rapper “[has] got a double chin, a potbelly and droopy man-breasts. 
And he’s living a reclusive lifestyle in an attempt to hide his new body”
 — had fans worried about Eminem. But 50, who in recent weeks has battled rumors about his own weight thanks to online photos that show him looking extra gaunt, said that those worries are unfounded. According to him, Em’s fine and in fighting shape (or at least, balling shape).
“The last time I seen him we played basketball together,” 50 said. “He had a knee injury, so we chilled for a little bit.”

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Haha
Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knives I like those
I might just go deep at the end of tonight's show
With the right dose I might wipe out with this light pole
But the strangest things can happen from jabbing pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches to slap up
. 
and drastic ass kicks
, 
gay bash
 
and and fags with tired iron and ratchets
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Varsace [Wo hey]
Anarchy
 [Ho]
Might've asked somebody you probably know
But you faggets keep
 screamin' "It's not me, no!"
Drag 'em out the closet and across the floor
Wouldn't
 pay them a visit in the hospital
And stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils 
till it pops and goes skit
 and sit back and watch 'em choke
[Hook: Eminem]
Cuz every chair that I throw
People sue me for those
They press charges on me
Till I can't fight anymore
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
So I suggest you stay home
Haha
It's time to play

[Intro]
Yo, follow me
, 
come with me to the dark side of the force
No man would boldly go, to this place
The devil only knows, of this world
So dark and oh so cold, it's oh so cold, oh so cold
[Hook]
Soon as my flow starts, I compose art like the ghost of Mozart
Even though they all say that they're real, I know that most aren't
Boy you think you're clever, don't ya? Girl, you think you're so smart
Come with me to another side in a world so cold and so dark
A world so dark, a world so cold, a world where only some will go
But none return, when will they learn? Where do they go? God only knows
 
(Stay wide awake)
[Verse 1]
Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta
I enter Central Park, it's dark; it's Winter in December
I see my target, put my car in park and approach a tender
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her
Sit down beside her like a spider,
 
hi there girl, you mighta
Heard of me before
, 
see whore, you're the kind of girl that I'd a-
-ssault and rape then figure why not try to make your pussy wider?
Fuck you with an umbrella, then open it up while the shit's inside ya
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah, now let's see her have triplets
 
and I'll di-
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-
-hyde and cyanide,
 
girl you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun outta
Murder
 
and I'd rather go "vinn-vinn!"
 
and now you see just how the
Fuck I do just what I do when I cut right through your scalp
Shit, wait a minute I mean skull, my knife seems dull, pull another one out
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it frightens me
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy
It's making me play hide-and-seek, like Jason I'm so hungry
She's naked, see, no privacy but I can see she wants me
So patient, see, I try to be
 
but gee, why does she taunt me?
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep
, 
I creep right through the front
See, so blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound sleep
"Who's waking me so violently and why's he on top of me?
He's raping me," she tries to scream, "Somebody please get him off me
He's taping me, he's biting me, he's laughing like it's funny"
She's scraping me, she's fighting me, she's scratching like some dumb freak
Escaping me, no dice, you see, I might just be Ted Bundy
Or Satan, gee what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties
I'm crazy but it's all right with me, man life can be so empty
Stay away from me cause I'm dancing to quite a different drumbeat
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Better try to stay wide awake, or you might end up found dead by the lake
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'mma try to take
Pray for light of day right away,
 
why do they try to fight today?
I must make them pay twice as much,
 
might as well put the knife away
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now,
 
are you in the shower?
Scour you for 6 hours 'til outage of power outlets
How did you figure out I was down in your basement, now ya
Musta just heard the sound of my stomach growling from down there
Prowler, there's no one fouler; bound ya, that's how they found ya
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how you cower
Jump out on you now like I was Jawa from fucking Star Wars
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye, beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die
Ought to not even bother to scream, it don't even matter
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya
Not your everyday Damien,
 
bathe me in holy water
Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that
, 
here I come with axe
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hacking 'em up with that
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's coming in from the back
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Step right up, I'm about to light up the skyline
So bright, I'mma fuck your whole night up
Light up your glow sticks and go stick a stick in your ass
This is the ghost of Christmas past
This is your host, you're supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross but listen close, if you don't
You can go stick your whole frickin' nose against his crack
'til he lets one go and blows your whiskers back
And get a great big old whiff cause if you last without passing out
You'll be on the next episode of Fear Factor,
 
yeah, I'm back to, back to what?
I don't know, smack a little child actor's butt, Mike Jackson, what?
What the fuck you want? I got a blunt and some Jesus juice
Who needs an excuse these days
The way they rally around pedophiles, you lucky I don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later as long
As it ain't a racist tape from '88, than I'm straight of that cannot be forgave
If I drank pee for, 18 years straight and ate shit every day
On a porcelain plate that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak, knife
For the rest of my life and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by Vanilla Ice
Twice a day, cause I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager
Blaow-blaow, Shade uh 45,
 shorty, let me get your number, baby
Maybe I can hump your leg or something?
But it's time for me to go, so I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that boob, right?

[Receptionist]
Mr. Berman?
[Steve Berman]
What?
[Receptionist]
We have Eminem here to see you
[Steve 
]
About fuckin' time!
Send him in (Steve! Good to see ya man)
Look who decided to show his face!
I hope you've had fun in the last 4 years
(Look man, I apologise again 
for-)
For shooting me?! Do you know I lost the use of my right arm?
(Again, it was a mistake,) (a terrible mist-
 
are you wearing a bulletproof vest?
)
And then you go and you do what? hide out? stay in Detroit from us 5 years
 
while the music industry melts the fuck down?
Do you know how many people lost their jobs because of your fuckin vacation?
(Well that's actually why I'm here, I was gonna, put out some new music and I wanted to play it for you, and get your opinion)
Do I really need to hear it?
Let me guess, another album about poor me, I'm so famous that it's ruined my rich little life, and I'm such a tortured artist
Let me make music about it and my tragic love life
, am I on to something here? (Come on man it's not like that yo-)
You know what? Just hand the fuckin thing over I'm done talkin to you. Think you can just come and go as you please
Big selfish superstar 
(Steve, I had a drug problem)
Oh poor me, I had a drug problem
Who hasn't had a drug problem in this town? 
You know what?
(*gun cocks*)
(Hey! hey!) Just lay the shit down on my desk and get the fuck out (Woah, woah, woah. Jesus Christ man!)
(Alright alright here, fine) What's this shit?
 
Two CD's?
(
That's what I've been tryin to tell you man, there's 2 albums)
Just get out! (Alright!)
Get the fuck out (Alright man, see you later)
(*bottle smashes*)

Eminem: Wh-wha-what's the problem?
Steve Berman: Violet Brown told me to go fuck myself!
Eminem: Who's Violet-
Steve Berman: Tower Records told me to shove this record up my ass
Do you know what it feels like to be told to have a record shoved up your ass?
Eminem: But I-
Steve Berman: I'm gonna lose my fucking job over this
Do you know why Dre's record was so successful
He's rapping about big-screen TV's, blunts, 40's and bitches
You're rapping about homosexuals and Vicodin
Eminem: I mean-
Steve Berman: I can't sell this shit!
Eminem: What-
Steve Berman: Either change the record or it's not coming out!
Eminem: What I-
Steve Berman: Now get the fuck out of my office!
Eminem: What am I supposed-
Steve Berman: NOW!
Eminem: Alright man, whatever

[Verse 1]
I’m the American Dream
, 
I’m the definiton of white trash ballin’
I’m right back on em, with a 
(chicka chicka chicka)
I can’t call it; same shit, different toilet
Oh, you got a nice ass, darling
Can’t wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fuckin’, you take me for a friend?
Lemme tell you the whole story of Shady’s origin
You’ll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father
I must’ve got my pimpin' genes from him, the way he left my momma
I’m a rolling stone, just like him
, 
 word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby I’m making a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me,
 
I’m as calm as the breeze
I’m the bee’s knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a 
superstar
 girl, I’m ready for you, mama
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pajamas
[Hook]
So bad, I’m so good (that I’m so bad)
I guarantee I’ll be the greatest thing you ever had
Cause you ain't never met nobody like me
And you ain't gonna wanna fuck nobody else again
[Verse 2]
I'm equivalent to a shot of 
Cuervo
First I’ll kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby you can lay down on the table
But you may wanna find something more stable
I told you I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying, April
I'mma make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From these phony, little fishy and sissy fake G’s
Skip over the "huggy bear", and all the "kissy face", please
Initiate Phase 3, missy, now service me
Take another shot of Jäger, shake it so nervously
Take your time baby, oh you’re the bomb baby
Oh you’re doing that even better than your mom, lady
I told you why I’m Shady
, you didn't listen, now did you?
Relax woman, you know that I’m only kidding with you
Got a twisted sense of humor, its warped, but I didn't hit you
I think you’re finally starting to get the picture, I’m just
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Call me dynamite...dynamite...dynamite, soul
Call me dynamite, dynamite, dynamite soul
I can hold you in the morning but in the evening I gotta go
Cause I'm on to the next girl and the next girl I kind of like
[Verse 3]
I got you caught up in the rapture
Make you recapture the feelings you had for
Your last boyfriend, before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, you're
Sweating, but if I’m what you wanted
Why’d you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl, don't be so frantic, I’m just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's so organic
You can’t ignore it, so don't just stand before it
Just drop them panties to the floor, let’s get to camcording
Damn shawty, I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back
And throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blind that
You couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
So stop at the store, pick a pint up
Let's get the pineapple Schnapps going
No one will knock cause I'mma hang a sign up saying "don't disturb"
Shawty I’m so superb, I say the right things
Don't I spit the dopest words?
[Hook]
[Bridge]

Kume bai yah, kume bai yah, kume bai yah, D-12, kume bai yah, D-12, kume bai yah
I've had a special request for...
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers, but nothing compares to those blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice boy who's counting?
 
Bhut:)a nothing compares to those purple yellow blue and pills
Cool, calm, just like my mom, with a couple of valium inside her palms!

[Produced by Bass Brothers]
[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Am I afraid of death?
Hell yeah, I'm afraid of death
I don't want to die yet
A lot of people think that I worship the devil
That I do all types of retarded shit
Look, I can't change the way I think
And I can't change the way I am
But if I offended you good
Cause I still don't give a fuck
[Verse 1]
I'm zoning off of one joint stopping a limo
Hopped in the window, shopping a demo at gunpoint
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?
Fuck a needle here's a sword, body pierce with this
Living amok, never giving a fuck
Gimme the keys
I'm drunk and I've never driven a truck
But I smoke dope in a cab
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab
Come back the next week and re-open your scab
A killer instinct runs in the blood
Emptying full clips
 
and burying guns in the mud
I've calmed down now I was heavy once into drugs
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz
My brain's gone
My soul's worn and my spirit is torn
The rest of my body's still being operated on
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writing this rhyme
Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightning this time
[Hook]
For all the weed that I've smoked
Yo this blunt's for you
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you too
To all the friends I used to have
Yo I miss my past
But the rest of you assholes can kiss my ass
For all the drugs that I've done
Yo I'm still gonna do
To all the people I've offended
Yeah fuck you too
For every time I reminisce
Yo, I miss my past
But I still don't give a fuck y'all can kiss my ass
[Verse 2]
I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled, it was still blue
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles
And pull you apart from both angles
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins
And bust open like broken water mains
So tell Saddam not to bother with making another bomb
Cause I'm crushing the whole world in my palm
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb
Buy your Mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on
And the pants to match
Here momma, try em on
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives
A brain full of adverbs,
 
and a box full of laxatives
Shitting on rappers
Causing hospital accidents
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it
Spent a million a track and went over my budget
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?
I can't rap anymore
I just murdered the alphabet
Drug sickness got me doing some bugged twitches
I'm withdrawing from crack so bad my blood itches
I don't rap to get the women, fuck bitches
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes
Never ran with a clique
I'm a posse
Kamikaze, strapping a motherfucking bomb across me
From the second I was born my Momma lost me
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday
Retarded
What did that nurse say
Brain damage
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
One night I had a dream while I was knocked unconscious
Became a rapper, something I was told I could not accomplish
Every track, I demolished, my name was gettin' polished
When fans heard my music they were completely astonished
Too much money to deposit, cash overflowing my pockets
My children saw me as the dad that everyone always wanted
Because of music there was no need for me to go to college
Every track I was on was obliterated and demolished
I even got to sing at halftime at the Superbowl
After all my years of hard work, I was finally successful
I showed the world that my inner soul was full of potential
I taught people how to have motivation and was viewed as a good example
My life was finally lived with happiness and hardly stressful
But then I woke remembering my dream from the night before
Only to realize it wasn't a dream but a goal
Battleship in this bitch and practice don't do shit to your interests
Slittin' wrists is a sin in your abyss of a brain
That don't sound too much like a Lucifer to me you're a shame
Underrated I am, you're a joke. It says it all in your name
Now who could ever be more stupider than Lucifer
Miley Cyrus, the Grammy Awards, Helen Keller, a cucumber
All you ever do is slob on the mic, you're a drooler
I was the ruler and i still am but cooler
[Hook]
The leader of the world
Do i have to teach you twists and twirls
Teach you to make fun of girls
[Verse 2]
Fuck this, Ill walk into you, Sit you're wife on you're couch
In front of you're kids ill tie off her blouse
Smack her with my dick until she opens her mouth
Tie the father in a chair, Fuck his daughter right there
I ain't give a quarter size care
Ill kidnap 2nd grade teacher, And say in the substitute
Tell the boys it not okay to fuck a dude
Tell the girls not to be fucking prude
Tell the whole class to be ignorant, And fucking rude
I talked Robin Williams into taking his life
Handed a knife, He said pill would seem more right
I took his wife and fucked her the very same night
Cold blooded killler, And you won't stop this hippie
Make fun of faggle moore for being thrifty
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Let me tell you about my style of music
My style impacts you, almost makes you want to use it
It's not even a style, so unique and different, thats why I choose it
So listen in for a while, and pick up and wonder I do it
Because it's the type of shit that makes you want to
Kill, steal, pill, drill, chill, ill, will, and fullfill
Any task, because my shit pumps you up
Fuck, I'm the leader of the pack, you bitches are pups
My style is like taking every rap in the world
Make it into a drug, put it into paper and curl it
Smoking it, and feeling the VPFL and goin' crazy
I make Jay-Z look lazy, You pussy rappers are sweeter than a daisy
Gobblin' rappers up, ain't even tasty
And yall are wondering why I've been on fire lately
Because my raps are insane, like I have rabies
[Hook]

[Intro]
Psst, hey, listen
La la la la la la la la la laaaa, I love my job
Makes me feel like ... Superman!
La la la la la la la la la laaaa
Can you fly, I can
Wanna see
[Hook]
I'm only entertaining you
My goal is to stimulate, making you high
And take you and I
To a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm, I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic, so let me entertain you, yeah
[Verse 1]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire
No wonder why I constantly bomb back
To combat attacks with constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took outta context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest, I guess
But maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought, see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit, I really should've fell but I stood
See I came like a flame in the night
Like a ghost in the dark; there's a ray, there's a light
There's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye to eye
Until they decide to set the differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children follow my lead and feel the vibe, because
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
My music can be slightly amusing
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious, it might be confusing
Just trying to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid, ain't it,
 
I get sick of tryin' to explain it
See I could sit and argue with you but it goes beyond
Just being a snot, pointy-nosed bleach-blond
Cause I came here to uplift; let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
Let me entertain you like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone, rebuilding
World revolving, still evolving, still Slim
How many kids'll copy, probably millions
But I'mma do this as a fuckin' hobby till then, cause
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My lyrical content contains subject matter
That sucks up all these fucked up young kids
At an alarming rate
; 
common denominate
Add it up and you'll see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
And mimic every move you make, Slim, you great
But wait, can't you see I'm only here to entertain
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
Cause man, I see it, feel it, live it, but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced and pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I've been through pain
If you get to know me I could be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy probably tears you up inside as much
And it's such a pleasure, every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust, but
[Hook]
[Backmasked]
I'm not here to save you
I'm only here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine

[Intro: Ken Kaniff]
Uhh, hell yea man, hm, oh fuck yeah
When I'm not at home beating my shit to death
I'm listening to The Madd Rapper's album
This is Ken Kaniff and I'm still mad as hell, fuck you
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm crazy with this razor, with this razor I'm crazy
With this crazor I'm razy, razor crazed, I'm crazy
(Okay, I'm re-loaded)
 
Go bring Jay-Z
(Tell them him I'ma ghostwrite for him) On Dre's beats
Ran in the ladies' room naked in a blanket
At the banquet and started to spank it (ahh)
Came in the bank with a tank fired a blank at the clerk and handcuffed her ankles
To the safe and thanked her but I didn't take nothing (thanks)
Every bullet came from the same gun, just from different angles
Cause I was picking strange places to aim from
(Man, I bet you fifty bucks you won't jump out the window Shady)
*Crash* (Ahhhh!!)
 
PAY ME
[Verse 2: The Madd Rapper]
Psyche, no 
bread
Fucked up in the head
Shot my girl and my sister cause I caught them in bed
(Wait, wait, wait)
I'm a crazy motherfucker might shoot me a Fed
Or I just might start a fist fight instead
See as far as the dough go, I go loco
See me pumpin' gas at your local Sunoco
Stuck off the hydro, mixed with cocoa
Jump turn styles, then run from po-po
[Hook: The Madd Rapper & Eminem]
Life stinks, we don't give a fuck son, we crazy
Tear up the clubs and do drugs, we crazy
Fuck wild hoes and bust slugs, we crazy
Madd rapper is crazy
Slim Shady is crazy
[Verse 3: The Madd Rapper]
I wish I'd been aborted, 
my pockets got a shortage
Everything I wanna floss I can't afford it
I'm trying to sell an o,
 my pops trying to snort it
My daughter's babysitter is about to be deported
I'm mad cause I still stand in line for clubs
Mad cause my rottweiler still shits on the rugs
(God Dammit Spike)
Feeling kinda crazy now, I just might flip out
Slim Shady gave me shrooms and I might trip out, like
(Eh.... Oh... Dude
Yo, this shit is crazy... oohhhh..... This is
Incredible... ohhh....)
Fuck that Slim keep that for yourself
You a crazy white dude and you need some help
Word
[Verse 4: Eminem]
I got a beautiful wife, kids, and a gorgeous home
What would make me jump in the tub with a cordless phone?
I'm straight vicious, I hit you with plates and dishes
Leave you with eight stitches
What I'm gay cause I hate bitches
Slut, don't be nice to me, I've had it with girls
And I'll still be mad at the world
Even if it apologized to me
 
(sorry)
You're hearing the last thoughts of a man about to blow his fucking brains out
Fall back with a blood stained blouse on top of his spouse
Spread out on a blood stained couch
In front of his kids that he just killed in the same house
I'm sicker than Boy George
 
picturing Michael Jackson
In little boys' drawers shopping at toy stores
Shady said it, Shady meant it
I stay demented
I'll throw a stroller at you, with a baby in it
Go ahead pull the plug, think I won't smack you
I just dropped a fucking pill mom, don't vacuum
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
You used to say that I'd never be
Nothing without you and I'd believe
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe
Just lay here with me, baby, hold me please
And I'd beg and I'd plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, "Baby, please don't leave"
Snatch the keys from your hand, I would squeeze
And you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fucking with me
And you must hate me
Why do you date me, if you say I make you sick?
And you've had enough of me
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the edge
[Hook]
But you won't break me, you'll just make me stronger than I was
Before I met you, I bet you I'll be just fine without you
And if I stumble, I won't crumble,
 
I'll get back up and uhh
But I'mma still be humble when I scream "Fuck you"
Cause I'm stronger than I was
[Verse 2]
A beautiful face is all that you have
Cause on the inside you're ugly and mad
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave
Please stay here with me, baby hold me please
And I'd beg and I plead, drop to knees
And I'd cry and I'd scream, baby, please don't leave
But you left and you took everything I had left
And left nothing, nothing for me
So please don't wake me from this dream, baby
We're still together in my head
And you're still in love with me
'til I woke up to discover that that dream was dead
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
You walked out, I almost died, it was almost a homicide
That you caused cause I was so traumatized
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride
I'd rather die than you not be by my side
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried
Go to my room, turn the radio on and hide
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah
On the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde
I, felt like my, whole relationship with you was a lie
It was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?
Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda
It's like you put a, knife through my chest
And pushed it right through to the, other side
Of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda
Put up more of a fight, but I couldn't
At the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that?
Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen footer
Cause this morning I finally stood up
Held my chin up
, 
finally showed a sign
Of life in me for the, first time since you left me
And left me with nothing but shattered dreams
And the life we coulda, had and we could've been
But I'm breaking out of this slump I'm in
Pulling myself out of the dumps once again
I'm getting up once and for all, fuck this shit
I'ma be late for the pity party
But you're never gonna beat me to the fucking punch again
Took it on the chin like a champ
So don't lump me in with the chump-ions
I'm done being your punching bag
It was the November 31st today
Would've been our anniversary
Two years but you left on the 1st of May
I wrote it on a calendar, was gonna call
But couldn't think of the words to say
But they came to me just now
So I put 'em in a verse to lay
[Bridge]
And I thank you cause you made me a better person than I was
But I hate you cause you drained me, I gave you all, you gave me none
But if you blame me, you're crazy and after all is said and done
I'm still angry, yeah, I may be, I may never trust someone
[Hook]

[Narrator]
I gotta question for ya. What does this city know about luxury huh?
What does a town that's been to hell and back know about the finer things in life?
Well I'll tell ya. More than most.
You see its the hottest fires that make the hardest steel.
Add hard work and conviction,
And the know how that runs generations deep in every one of us.
That's who we are. That's our story.
Now it's probably not the one you've been reading in the papers
The one being written by folks who've never even been here and
Don't know what we're capable of.
Because when it comes to luxury
It's as much about where its from as who its for.
Now we're from America.
But this isn't New York City
.
Or the Windy City.
Or Sin City.
And we're certainly no one's Emerald City.
[Selected God Choir background]
[Eminem]
This is the Motor City and this is what we do.

[Refrain]
I know you want me baby, I think I want you too
(I think I love you baby) I think I love you too
I'm here to save you girl, come be in Shady's world
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you girl, come be in Shady's world
Ooh boy you drive me crazy, bitch you make me hurl
[Verse 1]
They call me Superman, leap tall hoes in a single bound,
 
I'm single now
Got no ring on this finger now, I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship, save it bitch,
 
babysit? you make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit,
 
girl you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase, I tell a mothafuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
, 
ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
, 
kiss my lips? Bitch why ask
Kiss my dick
, 
get my cash? I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out, I'll put you out
, 
won't get out, I'll push you out
Puss blew out
, poppin' shit,
 
wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice? Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What you tryna be my new wife? What you Mariah? Fly through twice
[Hook]
But I do know one thing though, bitches, they come they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday, Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day, maybe we'll someday grow
Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fucking runway ho
Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
[Verse 2]
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes, it's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what, that's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I call you again, I chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I be in, we'll see how much you be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I, I don't wan' flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I not a jealous man but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do, how could it ever be just us two
I'd never love you enough to trust you, we just met and I just fucked you
[Hook + Refrain]
[Verse 3]
First thing you say, (I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway, you're just plain old Marshall to me)
Ooh yeah, girl run that game,
 
(Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say? "Rot in Pieces," uh, that's great)
First off you don't know Marshall at all so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal, I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit,
 
leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy whoadie, you must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have, ooh girl that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab,
 
end up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax and slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl you just blew your chance, don't mean to ruin your plans
[Hook]
[Refrain]

[Hook: Liz Rodrigues]
This is survival of the fittest
This is do or die
This is the winner takes it all
So take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all
[Verse 1]
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared
I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there
From the beginning, it wasn't 'bout the ends
It was 'bout busting raps and standing for something
 – 
fuckin' acronym
Cut the fucking act like you're happy, I'm fucking back again
With another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end
It ain't over 'til I say it's over – enough when I say enough
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up
I'm afraid of what'll happen to them wolves, when the thought
Of being thrown into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff,
 
came up rough
Came to ruffle feathers,
 
nah, egos, I ain't deflate enough
Last chance to make this whole stadium erupt cause
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post
And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough
To fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?
They said I was washed up, and got a blood bath
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter – I can adjust
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss
Top 5 in this mothafucka and if I don't make the cut, what?
Like I give a fuck but I light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60 hop in and gun it
Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook
Me for bowing out I ain't taking a bow, I'm stabbing myself
With a fucking knife in the gut, while I'm wiping my butt
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut
I get excited at the sight of my blood,
 
you're in a fight with a nut
Cause I'mma fight 'til I die or win,
 
biting the dust, it'll just make me angrier
Wait, let me remind you of what got me this far, picture me quitting
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut
It's survival of what?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
So get your ideas, stack your ammo
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle
This is it – it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick
If I don't do this music shit, I'll lose my shit
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth
It's all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit
But my respect is overdue,
 
I'm showing you the flow no one do
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit
So there's nothing for me to fall back on, I know no other trade
So you'd better trade your fucking mics in for some tool-box-es
Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me
So pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve
Cause this is something that I must use to succeed
And if you don't like me then fuck you
Self-esteem must be fucking shooting through-the-roof cause trust me
My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me
I can see why the fuck I disgust you
I must be allergic to failure, cause everytime I come close to it
I just sneeze but I just go atchoo then A-chieve!
[Hook]

*Door knocks*
Steve Berman
: 
It's ridiculous, I can't believe it, what?
Hold on a minute
Em..
Eminem:
Whuddup?
Steve Berman:
Dre I'll call you back
Eminem:

Steve Berman:

Eminem:
Okay
Steve Berman:

Eminem:
And?
Steve Berman:
And this is by far the most..
*Gun shoots*
Steve Berman:
...incredible thing I've ever heard

[Intro]
I have no idea what I'm doing
I have no idea what I'm doing, but
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you
, 
Superman is a-
-live
 
and he's flowing like the Mystic River
Girl dont act like you never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six,
 
this a
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me
, 
I disap-
-peared
 
I was hiding in Freeway's beard
, just a
Hop skip and a jump from my skin, gushing
Nails into my face that I been pushing
Hellraiser, my face is my pincushion
It's like when I'm on the mic, I can squish a
Sucker like a
 
vice-grip,
 
my pen put ya
In the slaughterhouse cause ya styles been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on
My brain's on hyperdrive someone put the brakes on
[Hook]
Here's a smidget admitted to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, err ribbit, ribbit
I got ya slippin on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got ya slippin on my swag juice, my swag juice
[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]
I got it figure out now nigga
See, my minds on my money right here
And no one stopping how getting it
And Heinz should never left when I was Living
And probably wouldn't be getting pressed by all these women
And then again, I wouldn’t rap the ones I was diggin'
So annihilate the looking, and talking alot about the hood; Kim'n, Kim'n
Uh, So selena wheels, just like my dad talks about more John Dick'n
This girl talkin' how she pregrent, she crazy, so later I crushed that ho, and left baby
And never trust her, no shit! Even she specialize in massaging on my testicles
And I never trust her, a whole lot, even on the first date, she basically get her mouth rimmed
And turn around and ask me for a kiss, no bitch I’m straight
And I never really get concerned how my own dictates
I think I’m about to slip on my swag juice
I think I’m about to slip on your swag juice
(Oh, no! No! Don’t slip on your swag juice)
Ye, ye! I think I’m about to slip on my swag juice
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Slim is in the house, simmer down there sister
Bound to get you dizzy cause he gets as busy as a
Bee
, baby you can throw a frizbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? He's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a 
disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it?
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick with ya
I want a kiss 'fore I 
blow this bitch to smithe-
-reens,
 get the guillotines, this is a situ-
-ation that's critical as 
Dre spins his, uh
Turntables
 and he 
cuts a record like a scissor
Cheka chicka, checka chicka, cheka-cheka chicka
Who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute, I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast 
and it's six o-
-clock in the morning 'less you want to get some dessert
[Hook]

[Intro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook
[Verse 1: Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it, then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids just don’t give a shit 'bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJs playing them hits
 
"Oh, this my jam, this my shit"
We don't know a word to a verse
, 
all we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the song's ginormous, 
the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits?
Is it the beat, is it the rap?
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap?
And how do we adapt
 and get 
TRL votes
When 13-year-olds control the remotes?
And Asses got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-pha-sis on our sa-lyl-la-bles
[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc is in the beat
Then I’m gon' feature Em and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit and drive off in the Range Ro
Cause everywhere I go they love the "bling bling" flow
Bang bang, look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost your man a lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
It's just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow, you bought the shit
I guess you to blame too, I just found an angle
No more reality flow
I’m tryna time my album dropping with a reality show
Cock the Mac-11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her we in press heaven
No one gives a shit except some kids
Who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house in Malibu?
Em, your emphasis is on the wrong sa-lyl-la-ble
[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
They said 30's the new 20
Funny, must mean 40's the new 30
Interesting, cause ever since then it's been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now, it's all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what?
 
Detox drops, what do we got then?
So now our whole camps is running around
Scrambling over what to do
Gambling every time we put a record out
Just looking for that hook (
Wait Dre, look!
)
[Hook: Eminem]
Shorty, I love you and you love me too
We were meant to be cause
Shorty, you love me and I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
Go shorty, it's your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
It's the kid that flip flows who used to flip O's
And run G for days, you should see how I get hoes
I'm international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I'm sick right into show, 
riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s,
 
that's slang for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked Loc
It's not a game, me B, I ain't playing, 
beat behind me playin'
So you don't hear anyway,
 
you don’t hear what I’m sayin'
Me fin-nini-na, Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money
[Verse 5: Stat Quo]
There once was a time everywhere you turned
Shady/Aftermath was all you heard
But they say 50 sang too much, and Em got soft
And they say Dre just fell the fuck off
Well, fuck the fuck offs, 
all y'all eat salt
Be mad, we bad fresh up outta the vault
, oh!
New sa-lyl-la-bles eat ball, you fucks offs
Your house, your bitch, I'm getting sucked off
East, South, Midwest, even up North
Falling victim to wax
, spitting, bring out the white chalk
All for the gingerbread
, 
we get it and get lost
Catch me if you can, I’m running past while yall walk
[Verse 6: Cashis]
Shady made me for bringing it back
'fore the history of rap is gone with a snap
A snare and a clap, what happened to just spitting
About living in the mothafuckin' city you're at?
In the grimiest condition, I breathe in drama
King Mathers
 and Cash me, that's freak karma
I'm everything, anything, you can never be
It's a hidden, rhyme in the month deep in the beef
I speak with a piece,
 
no peace on my mind
I repeat every evil deed done of mine
No rest contest, contract to sign
By blood I'm in this squad for life
Hear about out my wind pipes and I just chime
I'm the reason you guys won't say that line
I’m crazy renegade like Em and Jay-Z
I’m Rosemary’s baby
, I want you to hate me
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
It is not about lyrics anymore
It's about a hot beat, a hot beat
A hot hot hot beat and a catchy hook
Nobody gives a damn about them syllables, sillyle-ables, whatever they are
I don't care if you gotta rhyme schmo, mo, joe, toe and glow
Now get out there and sell some goddamn records!

It’s not about lyrics anymore, it’s about a hot beat and a catchy hook
[Eminem]
If we gotta dumb down our style and ABC it
Then so be it
Cause nowadays these kids, jeez
Don’t give a shit bout lyrics
All they wanna hear is a beat and thats it
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed
Pick up some chicks and get some digits
And the DJ’s playing them hits
Oh this my jam, this my shit
We dont know a word to a verse
All we know is the chorus
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us
And the songs ginormous, the whole formula’s switched
Cause we don’t know anymore, what are hits
Is it the beat, is it the rap
Is it a finger snap or the same 808 clap
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes
When 13 year olds control the remote
And Ashley’s got a brand new nose
We gotta put some new em-phasis on our syllables
[Jay-Z]
If the emphasis on the compact disc isn’t the beat
Than I’m gon feature EM and get rich
And let Dre mix the shit
 
and drive off in the Range Rove
Cause everywhere I go they love the bling bling flow
Bang bang look at the way my chain glow
The ring on my fing’ cost ya man lot of dough, oh
The fuck am I busting my brain for?
Its just the way the game go, oh, it takes two to tango
You call this a lame flow

Cock the Mac 11 in front of Hot 97
And call my publicist tell her “we in press heaven”
No one gives a shit except some kids who just got into sex on the internet
So you want the chat room or the house of Malibu Em?
Your emphasis is on the wrong Syllable
[Dr Dre]
They said 30′s the new 20
Funny, must mean 40′s the new 30
Interesting cause ever since then it’s been in a sense
An extension for veteran rappers that are better than half
Of the shit coming out right now
Its all trash
The torch is gonna burn out before it gets passed
Jay said it’s his last and 50 and Em
Then what?
 
Detox drops what we got then
So now our whole camps is running around scrambling over what to do
Gambling everytime we put a record out
Just looking for that hook
[Eminem]
(Wait Dre look)
Shorty I love you
And you love me too
We were meant to be cause shorty
You love me
And I love you too
And I promise I’ll be true to you
[50 Cent]
Go shorty, its your birthday
You made it just in time to hear my wordplay
Its the kid that flip flows who used to flip O’s
And run G for days used to see how I get hoes
I’m international, I get my dick licked round the globe
I’m sick right into show, riding on lolo’s
Puffing on coco, my bitch in Manolo’s
Don’t fuck with the dodo’s, I sling for dumb hoes
I playing, I ain't got time to joke, joke
You fuck around, you could get your ass smoked
Look, its not a game, me B, I ain't playing
Beep behind me player, so you here anyway
You don’t hear what I’m saying
Me fin-nini-na
Fee-fi-dididee-yay
Just give me my check and I’ll be on my way
Sunny bunny money and funny
You ain't even listening and I just took your money
[GR Lynch]
This ain't top 40 or hit list shit
Not for TRL, no Rick Dees' picks
This is straight GRL ski mix bitch
Call me Strasburg when I pitch this shit
I leave these other rappers so tongue-tied
They just local, GR's worldwide
You sound like cabbage, ya wilted outside
I spit tomatoes straight from the vine
Leave these other artists lookin all sundried
A bunch of little stains, to them I'm Tide
Keep a stain stick in my Subaru ride
Glass all black can't see us igniting
Paint white out like you fucked up writing
Mount baker bout to get a boost in style
In the parking lot they can't help but smile
Ma'am please cover the eyes of your child
Gunz come out you know bumpin 50
Subie 2 shes covered with bitties
Snowpants blue like the sign for thrifty
So baggy what are those a fuckin size 60?
Burrito legs bitch, call me big shitty

[Verse: Eminem]
Don't ask me what's up with the hoes, I'm still working the kinks out
Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin' out
And I ain't chilling out
. 
Got an Oscar but I'm still a grouch
I use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch
Yelawolf, Shady, Tony-Touch, Slaughterhouse
Yeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out
Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
Nice try shorty wop, we can windowshop the jewelry store
But Christ for that price coulda bought a house
Besides only thing I ever had iced out was my heart since I started out
It’s F.Y.I, if ya ain't knowing
What, go with you? Where? Nah, ain't going
Oh wait, you wanna date? Oh, well in that case ho, it's June 8th, oh!
And kinda like Beethoven composin' a symphony of hate
So much hate woven into these raps
He stitches a bitch, straight sewin'
Shit, I'm beginning to hate clothing
I hate overalls cause they remind me of hoes
For Christ sake, they're shaped like an H woah and
You know what else starts with H though?
Hockey, shit, thought I had the place flowing
I hate to put you on ice but
You already had 3 periods in 60 minutes, great going
Plus you remind me of cocaine, ho
You always in the mirror with your face
So, I feel an urge to put you all in a line
And chop you with a razor blade, yo wait,
 
I'm an a-hole
Devil with a halo
Hell yeah, I'd nail J-Lo...to the railroad
Say I won't!
 
Better hope you can stay afloat
When I take the wind out your sailboat
But, I ain't playing yo!
 
Dope as Shady?
Don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat

[Intro]
Yo...Dre Man..Make my vocals sound sexy
Come on man, come on man, okaaaay
[Hook]
It feels so wrong cause it feels so right
But its all right, its ok with me
I'll do my steps all by myself
I don't need nobody to play with me
But if you just give me a chance
I can put you in a trance the way I dance
But don't nobody wanna play with me so I'm
Taking My Ball and going home, home
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm that guy man, shove a diamond up my hind end
And crush it with my butt muscles
 
while I cut vocals
Slut poke holes in ya shirt, jump in mud puddles
While I stomp mudholes in ya ass girl, now lets cuddle
Blood curdlin', your gurglin' on your blood, what'll
I do for my next trick?
 I'm feelin' 
won-der-ful
I think I might just do somethin' a little less subtle
Shove a fucking 
tonka truck
 up a little kids butthole
Feel the wrath of a 
psychopath slash ambassador
Of the valentines day massacre
Slash assassin,
 I slash her in the ass with a
Icicle and leave her layin' 
a blood bath while I
Put a catheter in and jump in the bath with her
In my spiderman mask man, just imagine the fun I can have with a strap on
Stick it up Kim Kardashian's ass and make the bitch run a triathlon
Are those pistachio's damn, I'd like to have some
Laying on the patio man, rolling
 
a fat one
Shady drop the magic marker, put the cap on
God damn man, are you that much of an asshole?
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm like Houdini, tuck my teenie eenie weenie between each
One of my thighs and make it disappear like a genie
Make the shit disappear like
 
Tara Reid in a bikini
Believe me
 
homie, you don't know the meaning of a meanie
They call me the fruit loop from jupiter
I'm tryna to maneuver the hoover up in your poop shoot
Don't move or ya might get it stuck so fucking far up in your uvula
You ain't gonna know what he was tryna do to ya gluteus
Totally tubular, sniffin' glue through a tube in the studia
Now who do ya think is more fruitier
Weenier smothered in peanut butter puttin' on a tube of ya
Eye shadow and man it looked nice, you should've seen it mother
I think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card
Then I'll go beat Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart
Then mosey on over to Rosie O'Donnell's with McDonald's
Jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shady, what are you doin' chewin' on a human?
Grab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back, BOOM!
And assumin' the fact that that dudes in the back room
Usin' the bathroom vacuumin' a raccoon
Skewin' a rat, a cat screwin' a baboon
You shouldn't ask what is he doin' with that broom
You should be glad he ain't leave you full of stab wounds
You in a trance, I'm back doing my dance, ooh
But there afraid I might get 
Sarah Palin by the hair
And make her wear a bathin' suit and take her para sailin'
Shady why you gotta pick on the lady for
Why you make her read 84 bed time stories to you in baby talk?
Cause I'm scared there's monster's under my bed
Kelly Pickler
 hid my juice box under my bassinet
No wonder my ass is wet, my diaper needs to be changed
You like graffiti dike, well I can pee pee and write your name
[Hook]
Fine nobody wants to play with me
Fuck you then bitch!
You guys are always mean to me anyways
All you ever do is rub gum in my hair and stuff
You guys are gonna make me...make me sad I'm sad
I'm gonna cry...I'm crying
I'm going' tell my mom....mom

[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo,
 
before I start this song man
I just wanna, thank everybody for being so patient
And bearing with me over these last couple of years
While I figure this shit out
[Hook: Kobe]
Is anybody out there? It feels like I'm talking to myself
No one seems to know my struggle, and everything I've come from
Can anybody hear me? Yeah, I guess I keep talking to myself
It feels like I'm going insane, am I the one who's crazy? Yeah
(So why in the world, do I feel so alone?
Nobody but me, I'm on my own
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?
If there is then let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one)
[Verse 1]
I went away I guess and opened up some lanes
But there was no one who even knew I was going through, growing pains
Hatred was flowing through my veins, on the verge of going insane
I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne
It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin'
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin'
And I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin' back then coulda got it
Almost went at Kanye too, God it
Feels like I'm going psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it
But Proof isn't here to see me through it
I'm in the booth, popping another pill, tryna talk myself into it
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissing people for no reason?
'specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?
You're lying to yourself
You're slowly dying, you're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem, you're crying out for help
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow
All I know is I'm wallowing, self-loathing and hollow
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow
My sorrow echoes in this hall though
But I must be talking to the wall though I don't see nobody else
 
(I guess I keep talking to myself)
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know
I've turned into a hater
, 
I put up a false bravado
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto
He's not a desperado,
 
he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled
Inside him,
 
one foot on the brake, one on the throttle
Falling asleep with writer's block in the parking lot of McDonald's
But instead of feeling sorry for yourself do something 'bout it
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted
Long enough, it isn't them it's you you fucking baby
Quit worrying 'bout what they do and do Shady,
 I'm fucking going crazy
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
So I picked myself off the ground and fucking swam 'fore I drowned
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around
It's different, them last two albums didn't count
"Encore" I was on drugs
, 
"Relapse" I was flushing 'em out
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fucking around
I got something to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal
I feel like me again, let me formally
Reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no
Signs of slowing up, oh and I'm blowing up all over
 
my life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up
Just keep slaying 'em,
 
rest in peace to DJ AM
Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um
[Hook]
[Outro: Eminem]
So there it is
, damn
Feels like I just woke up or something
I guess I just, forgot who the fuck I was man
Ayo, and to anybody I thought about going at
It was never nothing personal
It was Jus' some shit I was going through
And to everybody else
, 
I'm BACK!
 
Ha ha

[Verse 1: Jeezy]
I’m tired, I feel wired but yet I’m still inspired
To find somebody else for the job, tell me I’m fired
Really muthafuck what they say, I did my job yo
Hood nigga straight off the block, I beat the odds
Now you see a nigga, back to the wall
Now you exciting, now I’m done
Everything for you niggas but get indicted
Got niggas in the feds wishin I was still with ‘em
Death penalty, go throw ‘em in the ail with ‘em
Rather die int he hands of the judge then former friends
Man this shit is like an ongoing movie, it never ends
Same nigga say that they would, love you forever
Niggas get the forecast and change just like the weather
Got me feeling like a whole brick, cut with some pain
From winter days yeah, they start of sunny and then it rains
And even after all these years, it’s still storming
You couldn’t of told ‘em it wouldn’t be like this
You coulda warned ‘em
[Hook: Eminem]
Somebody better explain
Why my ears are ringing so loud
Someone's got something to say
Grow some balls and say it to my face
(Somebody talk to me) Ooooh Oh, Ooooh Oh
Somebody’s got a problem, I wanna know
Keep my name out ya' muthaf-cking mouth
Somebody talk to me
[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Walking like I’m talking, play it like I see it
And I swear sometimes I hear voices talking to me in my head
Some nights I slept for months, the living dead to get this bread
There’s two ways out this shit, a casket or the fucking fed
I rap cause one day I pray this might be my escape
Everyday I seal up these bags, seems like I’m sealing my fate
My momma worked at your gangsta, jumped off the porch out the gate
But I can’t let my momma bury me, thats some shit she can’t take
Most niggas hate when you come up and you doing something constructive
Police to the politician, my whole city corrupted
Wanna convict me for a couple transactions that I conducted
And my homeboys just might snitch under pressure
So muthafuck ‘em, it’s just me and my two nuts
And you can bet they gon hang
And bitch my resume gon’ check out til I check out the game
Sometimes that ski mask on my skull it took effect on my brain
And I still didn’t tell the shit, I’m sick of telling you man
Somebody talk to ‘em
[Bridge: Eminem]
Somebody talk to me
Somebody better explain, how my name’s ending up in your mouth
Somebody talk to me
Got 2 seconds to talk, I want some answers right the fuck now
Somebody talk to me
Cause if it’s me that you’re talkin’ about then I, I wanna know
Somebody talk to me
We almost past the point of being able to talk this shit out
[Hook: Eminem]
Somebody better explain
Why my ears are ringing so loud
Someone's got something to say
Grow some balls and say it to my face

[Hook: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin' new I’ve seen it all before
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Goodnight, it’s over with, that's all she wrote
[Bridge: T.I.]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it’s over with
That's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Goodnight, it's over with, that's all she wrote
[Verse 1: T.I.]
It's stupid how I go in knowin' everybody knowin' that
I’m sewing up the game, destroying lames they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat than with me they join
Others sworn under oath, or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get caught, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On the fast track, ain't no need for no pit stops
I just laugh at, nigga wishin' they was this hot
Guess they mad at me huh, really pissed off
Better that than pissed on
I’m the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin' Prime Time
Thought you niggas been knowin', ain't no blockin' my shine
Like my new Air Yeezy’s, you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin' life, you check to check recitin' rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate
Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey, my dough ain't in its right mind
[Hook: T.I.]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
You're starin' straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a Slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed, wait Sarah you're late
Your train left Mascara and eggs smeared in your face
Night's over, good bye ho I thought that I told ya
That spilled nut ain't nothing to cry over
Never should've came within range of my rover
Should've known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
To still come back to the crib
Must want me to mess with her mind
, 
hold up
She mistook me for some high roller
But I won't buy her soda
Unless it's Rock and Rye cola, Faygo's cheaper
Buy you a bag of Fritos?
I wouldn't let you eat the fucking chip on my shoulder
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't die for ya
Tryna pull 5 bucks from me is like tryna pull five molars
You'll get your eyes swolled up
I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch?
You're already bi-polar
[Hook: Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches knew as soon as they saw me
It's never 
me
 they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a Desperado
Now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
Until it's over with that's all she wrote
[Verse 3: T.I.]
The credit rollin', curtains closin', movie over with
But don’t get mad at me
Go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch, but she know I’m rich
That why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, give a damn, got it pourin' in
Pesos, Euros, Yen, ah ha, I’m paid never gon' be poor again
See me posted in anything, wearin' any chain
Never gon' see me toting anything
All you gon' see is bang
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah I’m on another level, but you niggas still can get it
It's all over ‘fore you finish
Sorry bro this where we end it
Won’t give you the satisfaction of me givin' you the business
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Yeah, I guess life is a bitch, ain't it Tip
And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back, I wouldn’t give you the dirt off my handkerchief
I’m givin' these hoes a dose of their own medicine
Let em get a good taste of it
I’m sure you got that relationship memo by now
But in case you didn't
I'mma stick this whole pad full of sticky notes to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin' it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker
That clock I'm racing it, double timing it
But I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time
It may take you pricks to catch on
While you strong arm, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-Mart like there's an apostrophe 's' on it, dog
And they say McDonald's isn’t a restaurant, well I guess I’m wrong
But if you gon' tell me that the A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs
You can get the F on dawg
[Bridge: T.I.]
And on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I’m as strong as the King
They were gone ‘fore they came
Now I don’t wanna hang
I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why
[Hook: T.I. and Eminem]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Goodnight it’s over with, that's all she wrote
I roll like a desperado, now I never know where I’m gonna go
Still I ball like there’s no tomorrow
"Goodnight is over with," that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said its over with
That's all she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote
“Goodnight it’s over with,” that's all she wrote

[Hook: T.I.]
Now I don’t really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me broke
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
“Goodnight its over with”, that's all she wrote
Streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothing new I’ve seen it all before
But still, I ball like no tomorrow
"Goodnight it’s over with", that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote

All she wrote, all she wrote, all she wrote

Man, Tip told me on this ho tip, best tip I could give you to hip you
Never let these tricks trick you
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit
Dig you a hole, take the shovel and dig you some dignity bitch
Shit you talk about some adivce that sticks with you
If I should listen to anyone, tell me to stick to my guns
Like double stick, it's you but fuck ‘em Tip, it's cool
I'm chillin' like a villain
Like the penguin in its fuckin' igloo eatin' fudgesicles
I’d rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love with you
Before I tie a fuckin' knot, I’d tie you in one bitch
You think this is some Nintendo game how fucking dumb is you
I’ll give you some mumps before I split some lump sum’s with you
So here’s a penny for your thoughts
But it won’t buy you a cheeseburger, although a nickle might just get you one pickle
Fuck it, it's official so blow the whistle I got a trust issue
That's a bombshell, scud missle
I gotta cuss at you to fuckin' cuss at you
Like before I rapped I was a motherfucking stud
Slut, this will teach you not to come drunk, stumbling my way for shizzle
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slot checks stob bizzle
So fuck Sizzler's, these Checkers are bust like a blood blister

Over the phone and when you see her she ugly as shit (god damn!)
Now at the end of date she want a kiss, AND some dick

And only one nigga in our crew make the dollar bills
Y'all fools just mad cause y'all ain't got a deal
Local rappers talk too much!

Manager tripped the alarm and you all get stuck
Cops got AK's, y'all only got pumps - that shit's just dumb
That's how Cousey got locked up!

Instead of telling you to wait, the nigga wanna push and shove

Now you got your dick all up in her fucking mouth
Pull it out and then you bust off on her favorite blouse

When your life wasn't raised up right
Then see your mother coming home with different niggas every night
And then you run into the one you don't like; so get the FUCK lost

[Intro: King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the Hip Hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the world famous Wake Up Show
[Verse 1: RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tales, MCs get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill
Is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercing holes in you
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through your box
Walk with alarm clocks, cars driving slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as Glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Tech is on
[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
When I woke up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up
When I was summoned, 
styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is coming look around your town is crumbling
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leaving MCs litless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher
, 
partner, you can't kcuf with the sniper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister,
 psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, cryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway and Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got 
Swedish women
 yelling "Tech N9ne's 
vild!
"
[Verse 3: Eminem]
This place is my house
, 
I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Ma$e's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house trough the front window
And heard this guy shout, "Hey that's my couch"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm ripping this shit, put a clip in and spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flipping vertical
Nose-first with the top off landing upside down
Get tied down and duct-taped,
 
fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
It's Sway and Tech, two disk jockeys
Breaking so many freaking needles, I wonder if they inject
[Verse 4: Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes, God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cause your tape sucks,
 
find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech and Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doing drills in the Danger Room
Big game hunting from high noon till the full moon
[Verse 5: 
]
With synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Karloff was,
 
when I cut ya neck
Leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, 
sawed off shotgun blast
, he asked
Why did he have to 
die like cast metal
Oh, see, now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution
On the Wake Up Show with Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution
[Verse 6: Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, 
wet
 and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinning like lead from out the head decay
Tearing your neck away, flood up the street with blood redecorate
Until the head of Jakes investigate
[Verse 7: Jayo Felony]
Sway can give it to but what you gon' do wit it
Tech can give it to you but what you gon' do
Rev can give it to you but what you gon' do wit it
I can give it to you, wha-wha-wha-what-what
[Verse 8: Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fucking up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, ominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you with this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive with me
Clone me like sheep,
 
I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul for sexual harassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fucking murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg, 
your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show repping with Sway and Tech
My tec's like 
Tekken
, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in
[Verse 9: KRS-One]
De-de-de-da-de-de-de-da-di-day
KRS-One coming with the Tech and Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck with sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, 
willing to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willing to bet, on a Sway and a Tec, they stay in effect
Never been a pain in the neck, they gaining respect
Nevertheless I wreck you, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just seckle
Ha-ha-ha, fresh for 1999 you suckers

[Intro]
I'm a little nutty and I know it
But if you go back and take a look at my history
You will see that I am not the only one
That's off his rocker, there were many before me
I was always labeled the black sheep
Of the family, what a bad seed I'd grow to be
But if you take a look at us now
You'll see the apple didn't fall too far from the tree
Alright look
, 
I'mma tell you the story from my side
Maybe you'll understand, check it out
[Verse 1]
You done witnessed unexplainable shit
Too insane to explain,
 
people run from what they just don't get
Maybe Shady should have just hit 'em with a little bit
Did I spit too soon? Should I have spoon fed 'em it?
But I was just so eager to prove I was even
Worth being in the same league or the room
Of the people of whom I was in
Every now and then, I look up like I was seekin' approval
Was it because of the pigment of my skin?
Or was it a figment of my imagination?
Maybe it bothered me more than it did them
Maybe it wasn't a big deal back then
But to me it was, see what it was
Was I had developed a complex from being judged
Proof
 
spit his verse, so I'm next,
 let's see who balks
I'm in the booths starin' back to see whose mugs
I get a reaction from
, 
usually the first thumb
Was from Proof and the rest of the crew backed him up
And no one lied to each other cause none of us had deals
It was real, we just wanted tickets for that meal
[Hook]
Sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
I said sometimes I feel like it's just me
Sometimes I'm feeling like I'm goin' crazy
But take a look at my family
Cause the apple don't fall too far from the tree
[Verse 2]
Ever since my mother was pregnant with a second egg
Cause she said that I had a baby sister
Who fell outta the window, I was too young to remember
Kansas City projects, I was like 5-6
And how come, I remember Malcolm, Isaac, and Boogy
If it was the projects in Missouri
Cause those were my best friends
 
until Isaac
Took my tricycle and my Uncle Todd went to try to go get it back
And ended up gettin' jumped and cut in the gut
With a 
switch
 and 
70 some stitches
Which is, to this day, why my mother still tries to show me
Some old fake pictures
Of a fictitious little sister who never existed
And this is why part of my life's so twisted
But I can never be as sick as that bitch is
And by the way that picture's one of my relatives
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
You probably have to peel back layers upon layers of pain
To see why everything I say is so insane
What's different about my brain
That separates me, from other players in this game
On the surface it may seem like a scheme
Or some sort of scam for me to get some damn sympathy
But that's the last thing I need
Is for people to walk around feelin' sorry for me
And I am not a G, never claimed to be
I gave my vest to Cashis, just hope he don't need it more than me
But we'll see, cause we ain't lookin' for beef
But if it comes our way, what do we turn the other cheek? Come on
[Hook]
[Outro]
Yeah, and I'm the crazy one right?
Whatever, then let me be the crazy one
Cuckoo, cuckoo, tweet

How the fuck he got an Oscar?
Passed out in his red Mazda
With his fucking head in his pasta
In the parking lot of K-Mart plaza
Across from the red lobster
Looking like the Lochness monster
Dressed like a cross-dressed mobster
Talk is cheap it costs less to gossip
I’d probably be a lot less
Hostile if you snots kept your shnozzes out the airholes
Or get fucked in all seven holes
Ass, mouth, pussy, yeah both ears and hah! yes nostrils
At the ozzfest with nas bumping das efx in wrecked up Datsun
And dropped two extra strength Watson vicodin out my pocket
They cost less I'm a hot mess cause I tripped and got my head stuck
In a wasp’s nest in the process awesome
Drunk as fuck
One sock pulling my boxers up with boxing gloves
But I keep dropping my fucking binoculars
Got two fucking hydroxycuts and four oxy's stuck in my esophagus
These three lesbian little stocky sluts
Thought I swallowed two hockey pucks
Started screamin' "Serves you right you cocky fuck!
That's what you get for mockin' us
Ain't as cool as you thought you was."
Bitch all I did when I walked up was have my dick in a sock
And it's a sock puppet so no strings attached you can all suck it
(Chick-uh) get it? Ah fuck it
Shits about to get hairy as motherfucking Chewbacca's nuts
Cocksuckers

Intro
[DJ Green Lantern]
Okay (Yeah)
It's about that time again
[Eminem]
Green Lantern
[DJ Green Lantern]
That's right!
[Eminem]
G-G-G-G-G Unit
[50 Cent]
Ha ha ... Shady
[Eminem]
We Back
[DJ Green Lantern]
Invasion
[Eminem]
Part II
[DJ Green Lantern]
The Conspiracy
[Eminem]
Cause we ain't going no never stop
You just keep wasting your energy
On us, you should find
Something to do with your time
And quit fucking with us cause
We ain't fucking with you
And we must be fucking with you so
Much you must be gone out your mind
They say I'm day away
From my entire empire crumbling
Speak up your mumbling,
 what the
Fuck-a yousa bibi-bay okay big-bi-bi-baby
This is Shady I know you was
Bi-bi-hoping we be-be-would ge-go away
But weeble mable weeble wobble
But we don't fall down like
Jam Master Jay's two turn table
Our label is just too stable
You're magazine so motherfucking thin
You using staples
To hold it together
It's turning back into a
News paper and yall got
Something for my ass
Every issue thank you, cause I keep
Running out of fucking tissues
And I could diss you but god
I was sick of looking at you
At least now I can see when
Nike's got a new ten-nis shoe
But-but I guess no good news
Is always good good news
Moving on to bigger and better things
(chicka chicka jeera)
50's blowing up
This year just keeps going up
What the fuck is going on?
Who the fuck is Norah Jones?
Shady wait a minute, baby
Leave the war alone
Just go up there and be humble
And take them awards home
Bush is to clear the
World of a fucking war zone
Meanwhile we got a war
Going on of our own at home
My minds fucking blown
Trying to figure out how
To fight my own clone
Rhine stones are so nice
They shine so bright
Especially at night
After a hit of ecstacy
Ain't that right?
Woahehhh wait a minute
I'm rambling, back to the matter at hand
It's Green Lantern
With Elvis Presley
The selfish MC
Back to the ruin rap
And destroy the industry
Single handedly
And oh man did we
Yeah me and 50
Obie, me and D Tweezy
And Nelly and Missy and Jigga
God damn it's all a plan
Divised by the man
It's a conspriracy
Against fake shit
And anybody who
Can't make hits
Their ain't dope lyrically
So fuck what you hear
And what you read about
We ain't ruining rap baby
We're just trying to weed it out
Outro
[Eminem]
Shady in the place to be seen
And I got what it takes
To rock the mic, aiight!
Still keep talking
Shit to me punk cause your magazines
Over in less than 6 months!
Ha ha, Shady Records, still Aftermath
And don't think we can hear you
Motherfuckers talking
Cause we can't we don't hear yall
So we just gonna sit back
For the rest of our lives
While you ride our dicks

[Hook]
I carry the cross,
 
if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
[Verse 1]
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats, from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS
, 
N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me
I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit
 it's hard to see 
R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin up the game horribly
Cause, I parted the sea
, 
then these novices targetted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin to be
The next me, yeah
 
I support him but he's blinded I see
Jealousy he love me to death and I'm buggin I love him for life
We both still mournin on our mother's, life
And 
I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor
, 
hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty 
mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin
Gotta keep a lot of heat
; 
30 cals
 
10 millimeters
40 cals plus the heckler, to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? 
The infrared show you what the tec about
Huh? 
I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy
We can sell mo', boats on the coast
Give, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low
But that ain't reality
, I look happy but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3
Will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil
BITCH! You the reason niggas be beefin, ho get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day
Million dollars ain't, what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate
[Hook]

Eminem riddled everyone by posting the squared picture of "The Equalizer" on Instagram
 - the movie with his favorite actor, Denzel Washington.
Just a day later, 
trailer has arrived.
It features Sia's singing and Eminem, most likely, singing a bridge to song. This snippet would be from their second collabo, with 
"Beautiful Pain"
 being first.
Eminem is most likely to do a full soundtrack, maybe even a music video for this song and/or make a cameo.
Stay tuned for more info on the song. As for the movie, it's coming 26th September.

[Intro: Bizarre]
Check this out
This is Bizarre
And this is the rap king DJ Butter
From tha Outsidaz
Bam Bam Bam!
Dirty Dozen
Outsidaz
Taking the whole world with me
2 blunts and I'm bringing ya girl with me
[Pacewon]
I'm high like Redman
Trippin' with a tab of acid in my head band
The names Pacewon I'll kick that ass quickly
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Four rhymes penetrate y'kidneys
When I die, I'm a try to take the whole world with me
(I got plans to lock it down)
Take it with me
Take it with me
The whole world with me
I'll be hittin you with rude shit
I be rollin' like crews with new whips
Call it stupid but I've mastered the fantastic ghetto bastard
More rap style to kick that ass with
Rough as brillo, nympho
Spreadin like info
More than the Jacksons got kinfolk
Ya crew not strong
They stink like ya mother's feet
When she walk in shoes with no socks on
Light as popcorn
Me disciplinin' fresh emcees that you'd be scared to rock for
I'm low down and I'm shifty
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Most 
emcees
 get slapped cause they sissy
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
[Eminem]
I'm in a soundproof booth without a roof
Drunk off 180 proof Vodka with 
Dr. Ruth
We in the vocal room inhalin magic markers
Sitting the dark lightin our blunts with sparklers
We got my man Pacewon behind the board
Because we tied the engineer with outlet cords
Bizarre's in tha lobby with the Beatles
Smokin bowls, pokin holes in his veins with dirty needles
We get all doped up from poppin uppers
And run a train on Foxy Brown
 without rubbers
Smokin homegrown drugs
That's why you can barely tell what the fuck we're saying like Bone Thugs
Hittin blunts till my lungs get too much smoke
And take one more short toke before I snort coke
Shit, I been doin lines all day
My mind's all played from smelling
 
Pine Sol spray
What, no hold up hold up hold up
Smokin laced weed wrapped up in a fruit roll up
My lungs are all swol' up about to bust open
I'm just hopin 
I don't die from snortin crushed Motrin
I need drugs, somebody fix me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
12 bluntz plus I'm bringin ya girl with me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
I'm not comin' back, so don't send no one to get me
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
Fuck that, gimmee all my shit free
When I die I'm a try to take the whole world with me
[Bizarre]
Wack emcees there's a new sheriff in town
Put ya guns down and die with an ill frown!
Tha Outsidaz doin uppas and downas
Clowners, even massa scared to hang around us
I'm a slob that don't have job
Peep through your window steal the cook from ya mom
We just starters, ya'll niggas hit the bitches
Smackin more hoes than Jo Jackson has felony conviction
Clouds of mushrooms I just can't see
Pull me out tha bathroom I'm bout to OD!
Nasty, dirty some say I'm filthy
Everytime I drop a rap I'm a be like
MMMRRRRPHHH!
Crazy high, have no fear
Wat the pussy of a girl with burning diarrhoea
I'm ready to box so the bell go ding ding
My crew's more stupid and whack than Zazu from Lion King
Who's the big guy high off Chocolate Thai
If you disrespect me you'll lyrically die
Somebody hide me, somebody get me
When I die I take the whole world with me
I'm bout to do your girl named Cindy
When I die I take the whole world with me
Your grandma said I give as good as cleany
When I die I take the whole world with me
[Outro]
You know my flo is so ill
Emcees on the microphone'll get verbally killed

I've got a riddle, what’s little and talks big
With midget arms and creamy white filling in the middle
That’ll do anything to throw dirt on my name
If it means walking the whole Mediterranean
Is he an Albanian, Armenian, Iranian, Tazmanian
No it's Dave, Raymond
 and oh, 
Osorio
So sorry whoa, but that was a long time ago
When I was just 
Joe Shmo
, rapping in Joe Blow’s basement
I apologized fo’ it before, so
Either accept it or you don’t
And let’s move on,
 
if I ain't shown that I’ve grown
Then get the bone, keep licking these nuts
You industry mutts, keep walking around sniffing each other’s butts
Or should I say asses?
What would be the more politically correct term to use for the masses?
The question I ask is..
How can I explain this?
How can I swing this, in English language?
If I switch to slang and turn mayn to mayn
Do I do it in vain, or simply to entertain?
Am I being real or am I being fake
Am I just a fraud or am I truly genuine
Or am I caught up in this hot water
Woady on my daughter I told you I love this culture
Don’t let em insult ya, I’ma tell you one more ‘gain
This is the environment that I was brought up ‘in
But every now and ‘then, I use my ‘pen
To get rid of some frustration, or should I say shon
Is it just another one of my subliminal ways of racism?
Your face is numb, you’re stunned you look as cold
Like that of a man who’s 70 some years old
And it only gets colder, which is why I understand
I can’t be mad at a forty four year old fan
With a chip on his shoulder
Who only owns half of a magazine, and the only way to have it seen
Is to put me on the front of it again
Only thing that makes him grin, is to see me frown
Papa can’t stand me, papa needs to take his medication and sit the **** down
In his new chair that goes round and round
That he bought from new money in his bank account
That I get him every issue when the thang comes out
Sit back and let his puffy clown hair come out
And let his black side arm wrestle his white side
Yell apartheid loud enough that he might slide
He might find someone dumb enough who might ride
But ain't nobody over here buying two white guys
Disguised as pro-black there’s 
no slack for a Hartford college grad
In a fitted hat and a hunch back, standing by the clearance coat rack
In some old slacks and some RSO throwbacks, yeah

[Intro: Teacher]
And everyone should get along
Okay children quiet down, quiet down
Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day
His name is Mr. Shady
Children quiet down please
Brian don't throw that
 
(SHUT UP!)
Mr. Shady will be your new substitute
While Mr. Kaniff is out
 with 
pneumonia (HE'S GOT AIDS!)
Good luck Mr. Shady
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Hi there little boys and girls
 
(FUCK YOU!)
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob
 
(Huh?)
Say hi Bob! ("Hi Bob") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom
And he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot
But his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot
And wait in the parking lot for waitresses off the clock
When it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!)
And even if they escaped and they got the cops
The ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge
'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job
When she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker
Crazier than
 
Slim Shady is off the vodka
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her
And dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander
They never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana
And what it might do to you
So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you
[Hook: Teacher]
See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
So kids say no to drugs (that's right)
So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh)
Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
[Verse 2: Eminem]
My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it?
FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut
 
(Huh?)
Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid
And spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold
And decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys
And peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive
And his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*}
His back starts tah - 
look like the McDonald's Arches
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*}
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"
Cause they took it too, so they think it's funny
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over
And his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you
[Teacher] (Chorus)
See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will)
So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack)
So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right)
And there's really nothin else to say (but umm)
Drugs are just bad
, 
mmm'kay
?
[Verse 3: Eminem]
And last but not least, one of the most humungous
Problems among young people today, is
 
fungus
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off
Bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it
Yum yum!
 
Then you start to see some dumb stuff
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em
And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?)
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair
(Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?)
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?)
Cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!!)
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!)
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D
They're gonna come for me and I'mma have to grow a goatee
And get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't
Cause I'm bad for you
[Teacher] (Chorus)
See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh)
And if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down)
And if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask)
She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will)
So kids say no to drugs (say no)
So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do)
And there's really nothin else to say (that's right)
Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?
(Outro)
Come on children, clap along
 
(SHUT UP!)
Sing along children 
(Suck my motherfuckin dick!)
Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad
 
(South Park is gonna sue me!)
So don't do drugs (
Kiss my motherfuckin' ass!)
So there'll be more for me 
(Hippie! God damnit!)
(Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!)
(So, fucked up, right now..)

- 
I'm gonna kill this bitch, I'm gonna kill 'em, I'm going to fucking jail cause I'm gonna kill this bitch

Packing this third eye, pursue a Cyclops
They trade in they high tops for nice sized white rocks (Excuse me)
Words in my right, that pass my left ear
Your style is ass-out like the Bulls are next year (you're GONE)
Fear this veneer, you get stung like virgins
Who that cat splurging instead of rehearsing?
Tough guys, degentrify your high rise
Looking more like 
Ronald
 than them fucking 
Fry Guys
Go on uptown fucking senoritas
In Taco Bell screaming, "Viva gorditas!"
Bring all your dogs - I give em rabies
They never had a chance like my two aborted babies (WAAAH!)
Got Pope John Paul the 2nd, praying to Satan
Have your vegan girlfriend cooking up bacon
On barbituates with that shit that you hit
Smoke my spliffs withcha, cause spinal bifida
[Slim Shady]
My nine is lifting ya, six feet when I spray rounds
Hit you with 12 shots in mid-air and four more on the way down
As eight strays graze through a kid's hair on the playground
You lay down on a stretcher (Don't get carried away now!)
No pun intended
, 
just hop out of your whip
And leave it unattended before I whip out this gun and end it
Unless you want it dented with bullet holes any minute
Cause I can leave your Infinite full of those even if someone's in it
Snatch the airbag, hit the corner and park it
Corner the market, I got her tied up in a chair and gagged
Bitches get smacked and grabbed by the hair and dragged
Like cavewomen
, 
while I'm gravedigging with Marilyn Mans'
[Hook: Mr. Eon & Slim Shady]
[Mr. Eon] If you got a bowl of hash better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'mma take your last hit
[Slim Shady] 
And if you spittin wack shit on the microphone
I'mma snatch it outta your hand so fast I'mma detach it
[Mr. Eon] So if you got a bowl of hash, you better cash it
You got a satchel, flash it, I'mma take your last hit
[Slim Shady] I'm flabbergasted off two tabs of acid
Threw my baby's mother in the hatchback and latched it
[Mr. Eon]
Yo yo, "Eon's wack now," how you think that?
Couldn't get on my record if you were shrink rap (can I get a rhyme?)
Desecrate a crate with these rhymes I be toting
Let's go back online and jerk off on your modem
I got stupid mucus from these loose lips
My loose leaf leave your whole persona weak
To the point that you stand up on your feet, best retreat
Let's go back in time and steal my whole steez
The Quickening, did a bris at the christening
I'm exercising, doing liftings and twistings
Instinct's the nicest, I keep telling you
What the fuck this guy on the corner been selling you?
[Slim Shady]
(Here - buy this) I'm e-mailing you, at the wrong website
And misspelling you, prank you and put the fear of hell in you
Escaped Bellevue
, 
stuffed the nurse in a purse
Disperse like I added too many words in a verse
Slim Shady, a perverted version of birth
Driving off, 
leaving a murdered virgin at church
The first person who searching the earth for the motherfucker
That pulled the plug when they should have alerted the surgeon first (Kill his ass)
Get thrown curves, and hit with your own words
Leave me alone bitch! I get on my own nerves!
And if I don't got two balls and a middle finger to throw up
I'm taking off both shoes and sticking each middle toe up
(Fuck y'all!!!!)
[Hook]
[Slim Shady]
Any disease out there I'm willing to catch it
Slim Shady
All praises to The High & Mighty

Now everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfucking hands up
Look Look
Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This free world got you gased up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1 pac , 2 pac, 3 pac, 4
4 pac, 3 pac, 2 pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pacs, none
This guy ain't no mother-fucking MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob who shoots
Himself in the leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standing here screaming "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
Don't ever try to judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? he's real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, 
He's shook
Cause there no such things as half-way crooks
He's scared to death
He's scared to look
 in his fucking yearbook, fuck Cranbrook
Fuck the beat, I go acapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here, tell these people something they don't know about me

[Vanessa]
Man I’m so sick and tired of fucking with this steel
They only give us 30 minutes to eat lunch and chill
My body aching just to get a buck
I’m sick of eating this shit off this fucking lunch truck
Nasty ass food. I’m in a nasty ass mood
I should’ve called in sick
Shit, I had something to do
[Xzibit]
I can’t believe that I’m hearing all this ravin and rantin
From Vanessa up in here at the New Detroit stampin
You need to get your food and take your ass back to work
Your dreamin if you think them corny ass raps will work
Look at ya’ll freezin out here like dumb fucks
Rappin away for food off this ragedy lunch truck
Who want wut? who pumped up? to get rolled up
I spit venom in every direction, soak some up
Look at this fat ass nigga, sloppy sucker
You're a ugly mother fucker
Your pop should’ve wore a rubber
Stop rhymin keep your day job Vanessa
Next time leave that bull shit home on the dresser
Speaking of dresses take a look at Paul the fruitcake
When you travel you probly pack panties in your suitcase
Made out of lace from Victoria’s secret
If ten men came in a cup you’d probly drink it
[Eminem]
Ok folks enough with the gay jokes
Especially from a gay broke bitch yourself, hey lo'
This guy's a doo-doo
You've worked here longer than me
And I get paid more then you do
Dawg, take a seat
What’s this guy standing in line for? He ain’t got money to eat !
Check this out yo yo
This guy cashed his whole check and bought one ho-ho
Fucking homo, little maggot
You can’t hack it
Paul’s gay, you're a faggot
At least he admits it.
 Don’t even risk it
This guy's starvin' to death, someone get him a biscuit!
I don’t know what they told you Mike
You must had them cornrows rolled too tight
This job, you wanna quit but you can’t
You’ve worked at this plant so long, you're a plant
Look at your god damn boots
For christ sakes they’re starting to grow roots
On this mic you get faded
You look like a pissed off rapper who never made it
And why you fucking with the gay guy, G?
When really you're the one who's got the HIV
Man, I’m done with this clown, he's soft
Fuck it, I’ll let homegirl finish you off
[Vanessa]
A guy like you would never get a real woman
You jackass go jack off
That's the only way you coming...

[Hook: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're trying to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me
For wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated when I blew, see
But it was confusing,
 
cause all I wanted to do's be
The Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winning a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginning to lose sleep
One sheep, two sheep
Going coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm...
[Hook]
[Bridge: Rihanna] X2
Well, that's nothing
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow, so I keep conjuring
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
(Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losing your mind, the way it wanders)
Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wandering off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
Cause I need an interventionist to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killing me and I can't conquer it
My OCD is conking me in the head,
 
keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head is saying
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the...
[Hook + Bridge]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Call me crazy, but I have this vision
One day that I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm
Coming straight at MCs, blood gets spilled
 
and I'll
Take it back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that,
 
pumped up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fucking children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are going through a struggle feels it and
Relates, that's great,
 
it's payback, Russell Wilson
Falling way back in the draft, turn nothing into something, still can
Make that,
 
straw into gold chump, I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the...
[Hook + Bridge]

You have reached the voicemail box of: Suck it
Hey, Em. What's going on? It's Paul.
 
Uh, I wanted to call you to let you know we're getting ready to shoot the "Monster" video.
 
We got dates for Rihanna and she's gonna come out to Detroit and we can get it shot.
 
We've got some concepts together based on your conversations with Rich Lee and I think we're ready to go.
So the basic concept is sort of like an Inception-type of vibe.
 
The whole video sort of happens inside of your head
 
and Rihanna, in the beginning, is gonna act as your therapist.
 
And you answer into her office, you sit down and you sort of fall asleep or drift off; we're not really sure
. 
And next thing you know, you're travelling in this elevator and the elevator sort of represents your journey and your career. And there's various stops along the way.
 
We're gonna recreate some scenes from some of your classic moments.
I had to go home and get my straightjacket.
 
Redoing this scene actually brings back no memories for me because I don't remember it.
 
Dr Dre would say, "I'm glad to see you got your coat back on. The way things should be."
The scene from the "My Name Is" video, with you in the straightjacket and Dre as your therapist in the psychiatrist's office there.The song which recieved an Oscar for you ,yes "Lose yourself" will also be included. We're gonna go back and revisit "The Way I Am", with you jumping off the building, falling through the sky, with everything moving past you. And then we're also gonna do the classic Grammy scene, with you and Elton John performing "Stan".
"I can't see it all. Even if I could, it'll all be grey. But your picture on my wall, it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad".
So, all these things are going on in your head.
 
You're travelling through the elevator, looking at it from a new perspective, with you watching yourself.
 
And then when you finally get to the end of your journey in the elevator, you come out and you see this sort of caged beast. And the beast is actually Slim Shady.
Slim Shady's inside of this cage and you walk up and you don't really know what's going on. And then you see it's actually yourself.
 
And Slim Shady's feeding you some notes and we can just assume that the notes might be some lyrics or some song titles scribbled on them. And the idea that you keep feeding Slim Shady with fame and all of the things that go along with it. And the songs'll keep coming back out.
So, it's really kind of a trip. It's very surreal. Less performance than some of your recent videos but this is more cinematic and it's more of a story through this journey.
So, anyway. Call me back after you listen to this. Um, I sent the treatment over, read through it and get ready for some really long days. Later.
I'm done.
 
It's a wrap
. Uh, 
I never want to perform in these clothes again. Way too small. I'm try'na go, like, quadruple X next time. So, these clothes are a fucking wrap too.
 Peace out.
And goodnight. Give it up for him, folks. Thank you very much.

[Intro: Eminem as Bin Laden]
Oh Dr Dre
Or should I say Dr Gay
You are very bad man,
 
(biaatch)
You diss the wrong motherfucker
You think Osama won't diss you black (biaaatch)
[Verse 1]
Things just ain't the same for Osama
So much drama Since the World Trade Bombings
And the Pentagon got the world calling
Me to kill all of congress, like 
{Gary Condit}
The Strangest things can happen to an Afghan
When people get wrapped up in Islam and Allah
Then some shiteaters fly planes and wreak havoc
Then go drop the blame on Bin Laden
Now I got a faggot-ass rapper attacking me
With this gangsta rap, like I'm not gonna battle
Dr Dre? The man wasn't done shit since N.W.A
And gave Eazy-E AIDS
Don't make me go Suge Knight on your fat ass
You homofuck, 
you ain't the only one goin' platinum
Osama Bin Laden, keeping it gangsta
Fuck Dr Dre, I'm the Aftermath
[Hook]
Everywhere that I go ain't the same as before
People I used to know just don't know me no more
And everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who've got people they know, so I suggest you lay low
[Verse 2]
Oh Dr Dre look at you, you fool
I use your own rap against you, and I'm better
Lick my balls, until they are dry
Sorry... come again
Things just ain't the same for Bin Laden
This planet hates me more than Michael Jackson
Hating on the Taliban for keeping me captive
Threatening to find my little cave and blast it
Now I've got to worry about this wannabe gansta
Who pays other rappers to write his wack shit
Everyone knows that your beats are helped man
And you'll never blow by yourself man
Sorry, you'd blow... blow cocks
Use the hole as a straw and blow sperm out your nostrils
I don't give a hurried fuck, call Slim Shady
Snoop Dogg, D.O.C, Wren and Jay-Z
To write a verse, fuck I'll write it for ya
You still lick dick, this is Booshu Babara
Do you know who, do you know what, do you know who?
Let's keep this between me and you
[Hook]
Osama...
Osama...
Oooosama...
O-o-o-osama....
Biatch

I told the world one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy
Are they asking me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me
This is a beat with no words at first, it’s a blank painting
Exercising the mind, it’s brain strength training
My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low? Bring in a truckload with a high-low
My name is Chauncey Billups, I'm kind of like a raunchy Phillips
Screwdriver, my crew's live when you can't sleep and you're still up
I came in this game with, bad intentions
And I ain't budged, not even an inch since then
Lava on my lips I flips, wake up think I have a cramp
I'm trying to shove the lava lamp up my father's ass
Got my self esteem back, got my confidence up
I'm gonna step up on this stage now, I'm gonna strut
Shady man, I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not

[Produced by Dr. Dre & Mel-Man]
[Intro]
May I have your attention please
May I have your attention please
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up
We're gonna have a problem here
[Verse 1]
Y'all act like you never seen a White person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture
It's the return of the...
 
"ah wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he"
And Dr. Dre said...nothin' you idiots
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (ha ha)
Feminist women love Eminem
"Chigga chigga chigga Slim Shady,
 
I'm sick of him
Look at him, walking around
 
grabbing his you-know-what
Flipping the you-know-who,"
 
"yeah, but he's so cute though"
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't
But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit 4th grade
They've got the Discovery Channel, don't they
We ain't nothing but mammals --
 
well, some of us, cannibals
Who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women wave your pantyhose
, 
sing the chorus and it goes
[Hook x2]
I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up
[Verse 2]
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records
Well, I do; so fuck him and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird
Why, so you guys could just lie to get me here
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
"Yeah he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee"
I should download an audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing but not quite me
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3]
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it
In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it, I just shit it
Better than 90% of you rappers out can
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm going, when I'm 30
I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting
Pinching nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with
 
Jergens
And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings
Or in the parking lot, circling
Screaming I don't give a fuck
With his windows down and his system up
So, will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go
[Hook]
Ha ha, I guess there’s a 
 in all of us
Fuck it, let’s all stand up

[Intro: Obie Trice]
Yeah
Aye, Em, you ready?
Herc, you got them thangs nigga? (you know)
Detroit city!
[Hook: Obie Trice]
There they go, them D-town boys carry the Calico
Whenever there's war, you gotsta know
Them boys got toys tear down the front door
Detroit make noise everywhere that we go
There they go, there they go
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
You are not convincing
When Detroit blocks stay flocked with henchmen
Niggas get popped for instance, infrared dot for distance
Get knocked by the cops, cop on some pen shit
Straight detention, a nigga doing tension
Once released he on that music buisness
When viewing 106 and them cafeterias
Only to find that rap's actually serious
Deliriously resort back to crack and vigilence
Same shit that sent em upper Michigan
Us is pimping, a difference, from any city I visited
It's that Detroit spirit and if we in it, balling out till the ending, period
Use O as a reference to that sentence
The message I'm sending you, best just pay attention
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Big Herc]
If you don't like how I act then blow me
I don't really give a shit, I represent the real cats who know me
Man what's up with that scratch you owe me?
Now run my chips before we fall out like Shaq and Kobe
Big Herc on a track with Obie, 
when you come to the D
It's cut-throat, better be packing homie
And niggas get they shit split for acting 
phonie
We're known for the Glocks and the choppas
These niggas'll rob you, leave you standing in ya socks and ya boxers
We got real G's and lots of 
imposters
I smoke the real trees, see I cop from the rastas
Ya'll niggas ain't impress me yet
Ya'll yapping, not rapping, turn that shit off and press eject
See we known for the car shows, running from the narcos
Keep them bottles coming, we gon pop em till the bar close
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Meat cleaver, leave a gash in a bitches ass
See her dreams of being an R&B singer diva
Leave her face, cut her from the waist
Ah man what a waste, of a pretty face
And this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangsta
It ain't just New York or L.A. that pains no more
There's Latin Coun' Kings here
Southside, four, East Side and Gansen
Nothin' but ganglands and, spray paint cans
And when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancing
That window rolls down and that tre-eight's dancing
And them shooters don't miss, homie they hate chancing
Straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue Dodge flashing
Red and blue lights, no ambulance, you got flattened
And this was not supposed to be no Detroit anthem
But just so ya know, if ya see them D-Boys passing
[Hook]
[Outro: Trick Trick]
Here we go motherfuckers
This the motherfuckin back acha Trick
Don't even dream of fucking up in Detroit, bitch
This is where the real killers at
Detroit motherfucker!
Ain't never no difficulty smashing no bitch ass niggas
Matter of fact, bring your bitch ass to Detroit nigga
We got something for your ass
[Gun shots fade out]
[Laughter]

[Intro - Eminem]
*Beatboxing* Yeah, we should do something like that
[Hook - 50 Cent]
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, b-boom, Shady!
[Verse 1 - Eminem]
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business
Once again its the, illest and realest killas
The most villainous,
 
Dre protege, Shady apprentice
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes
Do you want losers or winners, this music is in us, and it's
Not over till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's
Truest form, the greatest, 
Hate us or love us
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep sticking them pins in us
Thick as his skin is
 or 
as short as his wick is
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is
Whatever, forever, he will be the 
illest
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next
He's already reconciled with his {
ex
}, a chainsaw and an axe
Jump up at your desk, strangle a neck
While we have sex, while Bill Clinton plays the sax
I sprays the facts, yeah, bring Shady on back
The maniac of rap, 
devil baby on crack
Resurrect, I never left, baby, I'm bad
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zie automatically
Says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that
Fuck it, I quit, suck on a dick, jackass
I'm done with this whack ass rap, 
kiss my black ass
!
[Verse 2 - 50 Cent]
Nah, Em, tell them to kiss my black ass, the clean parts, the shitty parts
My bullet wounds, my beauty marks,
 the Fif'll tear you're ass apart
A game in this game, crush a motherfuckers from the start
Shady paid me, Shady crazy, Fifty crazy rich
, bitch
Different day, nothing change, it's the same shit, trick
Teflon wrapped on, case I get clapped on
D's searching the whip, glad I left the mac home
Still grinding, still shining, nigga lord knows
You rocking with the kid to spit sicker sick flows
I carried Game's style for nine months and gave birth to it
Now I'm feeling like a proud father watching him do it
Everyday Dre day,
 front and cause a melee
Turn the town upside down with a frown upside down
I smile through something fowl, and watch my money pile
I'm fucking with straight stacks, I'm kicking you stripped facts
I hit you with it, bag it, pump it, bring me mines right back!
[Hook - 50 Cent (Eminem)]
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Go 'head front, get fucked up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up!
Now boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, I hit your ass up!
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, Yeah, that's what's up! (Yeah!)
Boom boom chuck, boom b-boom chuck!
Boom boom chuck, (It's the Re-Up!)
Shady, Shady

[Intro]
To the Batmobile, let's go
Yo', Manix man, I'mma take this one kinda slow, alright?
[Verse 1]
Welcome to the flipside
Hope he can swim, cause if he can't, he gonna drown on a rip tide
It's pourin', plus the old man ain't snorin'
Cause he gotta get up pretty damn early in the mornin'
Cause I'm slammin' like Basketball Jones
Swoopin'out thrones and nothing but the break bones
You suckas disgust me like low fat
Gimme a bat and I'll show you where your head at
Tryna hit the row with the paddles you little bocce?
I think you better stay home and eat your broccoli
Cause you still got a long ways to go
So you better step northeast cause you picked the wrong Joe
You ain't ready to throw with the mighty man
And don't forget about the rest of the band
So you better get used to the shrine
Cause I've been rappin' as long as I can write rhymes
These grandma hands make stuff like potery
To making too too many shots, you'd think it start an astrology
You wanted to live so tell about what you went through
You couldn't cut the mustard if I gave you a ginsu
[DJ Buttafingaz scratching]
[Verse two]
Quickly, step to the side cause I'm comin' through
You think you was lookin' to call me W or Double you?
So how could you think you outdid me
While I'm getting getaways quicker than a kidney
That was to a rabbit as sticky then you're a total pigeon
You know you couldn't even blow a rhyme in a circle
You little kiddies are getting a bit too frolicky
Throwing me lot more sorries than an apology
Pass me the chalk and the vite Court Plea
Let me give it the proper operation that it needs
So allow me to put a end to weak melody
Need it for suckers like peanut butter and celary
Switch up the zone and put words that I kick with ease
And you with the face, not feel a pygmy
And Let her resent like Tia's mama
More tooth than a sharp pair of sheers
And given that, I couldn't throw up a chop suey
You remember the day you watched Wicca Pool
Then you'll know what it's like to take a nosedive
Beat by Phattest skinny kid alive!
[Break]
Alright, we're gonna break it down for a second, and I'mma catch my breath
And I'mma let Buttafingaz do off on a scratch for a minute
Dude Buttafingaz, when I give it to you; come up with that funkyassdiculous-dope scratch
Go for it
[Verse three]
Yeah, let me show you how the big boys play
Thinkin' 'bout us bust out the back girl on a Wednesday
While I grab the steel and put you through an ordeal
Some miracle 'fore me will feel whose more real
I'mma do best, mom. Look out for the plaque
Start flowin' so much, I'll be in need of a maxipad
It went so fast, my pen undelaney
Do so many torques, my song will be a felony
You ever get to know me, don't corrupt me
Well shit, that's what you get for being clumsy
Get more, steppin' up. Finger the compitition
I got more jerks in my basemint than you do in twitches
Hope you all get played out like Batman
Work like pay dirt and bust by the Fatman
And I take over like a doctor
Boy, I'm on 'em so fast, I swear they make me report this
Who gets whip cream and hard as a calis
That's to all my lizards(?) He call me Mr. Mathers
With a soul intent for destruction
One more hit for the Downstairs Productions
[Outro]
The phattest skinny kid alive!x4

[Verse 1: KXNG CROOKED]
My name is KXNG CROOKED,
 
I snap on you rappers often
When I'm spazzin' I'm just gettin' my passionate point across
Like a hood cat clappin' his hands when he's talkin'
Now that I got your attention, I feel I should really mention
Don't come around here flossin', Big Willies, we really lynch 'em
Pull out the chopper, rappers hittin' the ground
Like every bar is a bullet, when I pull it, it sound like
B-b-b-b-b a couple of bullets are comin' your way then it jam
Like god damn
Then I pick up somethin' quicker, start killin' everything in the vicinity
The proximity, the Glocksimity, we on Yosemite Sam
Bam, bam your body drop
Van Damme, karate chop
The Beretta's a better competitor
Pop pop turn your sweater to a crop top
Killin' you and whoever in that drop top
Etcetera, etcetera and it will not stop
Just shoot, shoot like doot doot
And beaucoup, beaucoup, I'm cuckoo
I'm a star goin' to war with you clones like Count Dooku
I'm worlds apart from you rappers
Like I walk in the booth rockin' a biosuit made of plastic
And NASA's galactic elastic travelin' through space, interstellar rapping
Broadcastin' from uninhibited planets
When I come back, that's it
You see a flash in the sky, it's that nigga, I
When I land, you wack niggas die
And your casket is your last hit
You wack bitch, fuckin' bastard
Back to the hand clappin'
You die quicker than Darren Wilson walkin' through Ferguson
Dressed like the grand dragon of the Klan
Passin' niggas with pants saggin'
With their hand on a black Magnum
To clap him backwards
So their last words is "kcuf meth nmad saggin"
That's backwards for "fuck them damn niggas"
Buck them damn triggers
Charge us, bodies fill up them damn Rivers
Cause everybody wanna be the best rapper alive
But I only like dead rappers
Compare me to the best rappers who died
And you rappers I used to look up to
I gotta cancel you now
Like Simon Cowell, I can't let you ex factors survive
Nah, the time's right and they finally limelightin' the god of this rhyme writin'
My mic can only be likened to Poseidon's trident and Zeus' lightin' strike
And my metaphors are what Thor was to the Norse viking
I'm a born titan and at-point kill 'em like swordfightin'
I'm slicin' organs with songwritin', I dwarf giants
I hope I'm rubbin' you pussies wrong sort of like poor dykin'
I smoke philosophy, I snort science
That means I'm higher than higher learnin', look in my eyes
That's where the fire's burnin'
Try to deny music's messiah returnin'
You die and you fry in my iron furnace
I am on my get rich or die tryin' like when Em was signin' Curtis
Cause I am murderous
[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
(Joe Budden, Jersey City, New Jersey)
Now we can do this a couple of different ways, it really depends
Could give them classic NY jeans over the Timbs
Or I could spit about my car and how it sit on the rims
I could tell you why I'm hot and disappear like MIMS
But the bars there, put that on God, ask an atheist
And if I ain't the bomb at least I'm in the blast radius
I'm beating these kids' indictment, shit, I like the terror
APB on my actions, I'm in the viking era
Moment of truth, I give you facts right now
Fuck this cypher, my mind ain't on rap right now
So it's fuck metaphors and punches, all the witty shit
Got a missing uncle and another need a kidney flip
Face says I been stressed
I got an aunt getting her ass kicked by MS
Nigga, why am I here? For the look, for the promo
Shit that bothered from the start
Cause the cancer left his lungs and it's on my grandfather's heart
Yeah, but not the side that the beat is on
I'm supposed to put that to the side when the beat is on
I'm planning the funeral, I'm getting the hearse ready
These niggas only wanna ask me if the verse is ready
Not a how do I feel, not a how do I deal
If that's the life, nigga, then how is it real?
These last couple of days I've been speaking to my peers
Giving them cries for help, I guess they need to see the tears
But wait, wildest part of all of that is
They'll shoot a suicidal rapper right here on the bridge
But fuck it, gotta pardon 'em, shout out to my squad and 'em
House Gang,
 
Shady
, 
I'm gone, nigga, my job is done
[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Yelawolf, Gadsden, Alabama
My name is Wayne, I'm from Alabama
Here's the back story
I just fell off the turnip truck with Ernest Tubb
I'm 33, I've got 3 kids and I just popped 3 pills
I don't know which one's which or what it's for
Safety ain't really a habit I've formed
I still smoke to the cigarette butt
I still drink till I end up being that klutz
Clumsy, self-destructive dummy
Stumbling over my words, mumbling
I'll probably do it tonight
Leave the bar, leave the car
And pass out like a fetus in a jar with my feet up to the stars
And dream about that light that leads up to the lord
I have nightmares about my momma getting beat up in the yard
Wake up feeling like half a human
Hit the studio and unleash this guilt and regret
For my lack of union between rap, you and the rock and roll community
For unity between country music and MCs, I'm claiming immunity
Still I'm working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way Charlemagne the god and Lord Jamar thought it would be
Wait a minute... the lord and the god hate me
Jesus Christ, I am the white devil!
Nah...
I'm still working, sawing, milling this tree
Building this house exactly the way I thought it should be
Wanna take a tour? Let's see
I've got floor-to-ceiling windows and a cabin-style mansion
Books, bears, trucks, boats, tires, spares, four-wheelers
Three-wheelers, two-wheelers, a drug dealer on call
Plaques on the wall, racks on the wall for my guns on the wall
Lift kits,
 low riders, 
chop shops
, hi tops, low tops, cowboy boots
Dixie flags, American flags, 
Slumerican tags on my Slumerican ass
CEO
I've got my name on the bathrobe, and the flame on the back porch is lit
Guess who's coming to dinner?
André 3000 and Hank the Third, go figure
I've got two stand-up jetskis, a top pedigree horse, just a pet to feed of course
Who rides a horse in Nashville? I might
I've got bicycles for the kids, tricycles for the babies
M-80s
, bottle rockets, bottles in my pocket
Moonshine
, 
gold watches, gold rings
All fake, no bling, don't hate, that's my thing
I've got new clothes, old clothes, vintage, tremendous, endless style
Goodwill loves me Mackle-more than you
I've got flat screen TVs, with skate videos on repeat
All the latest CDs, mp3s, 
and Beats by Dre
Thank you very much, Jimmy Iovine for the check
I've got a black woman fine as she can be
FeFe with a ring on her finger that could give sight to the blind
A 5, a 10, a couple hundreds layin' on the counter
I don't know where that came from
I got artwork from hard work, yardworkers for yard work
Don't look under the tarp, sir
I'm growin' weed for my mama there
I've got a paved driveway and photos in the hallway of me on my Harley
And I did it my way
See, hip hop is what you make of it
And I'm makin' a lot of it
See that's a quadruple entendre, Jay Z eat your heart out
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
But these cyphers, I treat 'em like a war, don't want no mediators
Nah, this that grow up in the P's behavior, next door to the greasy neighbors
People thank you, I do this for all the mean creators
I was someone who never needed favors to get where I'm at
Now they deem me a savior
But to be honest I ain't feelin' like that, man I just really like rap
Y'all lucky, trust me
I'm opposite the hands of Sandusky
With the shit that my pen state, these rappers can't touch me
Ugly? Shit, you serious? I'm hideous
I was better than all you silly kids while trying to figure out who I really is
As a younger dude, life was somethin' rude
I barely made it to the first like a Cutler move
No rubber groove on my shoes had to fight, so suspensions
I had 3 in one week, yeah that was public school
Did I say 3 in 1? That's funny cause there's 4 of us in the Slaughter
That's a 3 and 1, I learned that in public school too
Like what's in between a 3 and 1 and House Gang, I spoke to all 3 on 1 call
Like I dropped 2 albums and #3 is 1 second from bein' done
Just need y'all 3 to send me 1 verse apiece
For this Heatmakerz beat and Brother's Keeper 1
Simple mathematics,
 
I'm addin' up to all these rap addicts
I don't like to divide dough so I multiply flow
And subtract maggots
Like a brand new Craftmatic, boy I'm back at it
Smokin' these new boys like my last habit
Dabnabbit I tried to quit but everything I kick's like the last dragon
Hoes suckin' my drummer dick, they on my bandwagon
I just gotta laugh cause y'all pushin' a lot of swag
I'm pushin' this big ole Hearse
, don't get body bagged
[
Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9
"]
These new rappers be askin' me
Why I don't be hangin' out where they be hangin' out
I tell 'em, I say "Lil nigga listen here"
If I don't got no business there, I don't got no business there
See there's a difference here
You hustlin' so you can be seen
Nigga I'm grindin' so I can disappear
I don't do it like other rappers do
When it's on time, it's skull and bone signs at the stu
We got guns you only find on your cheat code screen
If you think I remind you of any of these niggas you wildin' out
Like Chico Bean
When there's drama I don't ask no questions, I just clap in that direction
I look at this gat like it's an actual accessory
I'm anti-social so relax when you step to me
Nigga I shoot the breeze with actual weaponry
Your lil' stare downs won't fare well
I got a pale conscience, I'm the grey area
Last person I had a bond with was a bail bondsman
Now imagine me hangin' with y'all and we rappin' on the same song
Nigga I'd rather juggle a couple of chainsaws
Or run through hell with a pair of gasoline Hanes on
I'm a star but not on some I wanna be a star kinda shit
The only celebrity that give a fuck less than me is Marshawn Lynch
Glock in the stash as a backup but the MAC'll burst
Cripple your style, your first born child'll come out
With a colostomy bag as the afterbirth
I don't give a fuck
Nigga I'll show up to Beyonce's show posin' as Jay Z
Stagger in your studio session with a bomb strapped to my chest
Lookin' like Omarion holdin' his baby
Jump in the 4 door Mercedes with a .44 listenin' to JoJo and KC
Drinkin' and sniffin' enough blow that it got me thinkin' I can exchange sicknesses
Maybe, this ebola for rabies
That's it, just livin' the rapper life
Banana clip in the air, 
lookin' like it's 'bout to start singin' it's MAC tonight
MACs, I use this MAC as a component for thugs rollin' up
I got this MAC on and you better stay in that corner
Cause shit can turn into that song except I don't give a fuck what day it is
I'll have this club goin' up, fuck with me
Mack magnet, attractin' enormous green
Slap this clip in this gat then call this arm Christy Mack
Cause this bitch is that war machine
Life of a giant, but who needs size when you're wack and your team's soft
Drag your girl down this hill 'til she admits that it feels like she's jackin' the beanstalk
We both got marketing plans
Yours is to sell records and try to net more than you gross before
Mine is to punch you in your face if you ever disrespect me
And then go invest into a grocery store
Rolled up with the Smith & Wesson and drew on you like let's fight now
I do numbers,
 
I turn you and your crew into two plumbers
Translation, get your shit together and pipe down
Fuck a mic, I don't write, I chew and spit
I'll shoot you and your sis if you insist
I got my eyes on the sparrow
Silencer's so big it look like I got Bobby Shmurda tied to the barrel
And he doin' this
[Verse 6: Eminem]
(My name is Marshall
I'm repping that motherfucking Motor City, bitch)
I just turned Slaughterhouse to a quintet
Began to trend-set
, murdered the friend's pet
Made shit as ill as it can get went in depth
Like a fucking vignette and two bars skins wet
I'm already covered in sweat
And I wasn't even ready to come in yet
AHH, let me set this drink down
Beat up a gal, start beef with her pal
Probably be wild 'til I'm wrinkled and senile
And "Rap God" was a freestyle
Off the top of the dome piece while I was sleep on the couch
And I'm freestyling now
I need a towel
, sweat leaks from my brow
It's burning my eyes
, 
my cerebral is foul
Cause shit I'm thinking about should be illegal
I need my head banned
 
like the guy who left Cleveland Ohio
And went to South Beach with his talents
Scream "fuck you" on the way out and wink with a smile
This whole game can eat a dick, I'm going back deep underground
But right now I'm back on that bullshit and you I'm singling out
Cause you're so fucking outdated you should mingle a while
What the fuck is this clusterfuck of busters
Bunch of Buster Douglas', motherfuckers is one hit wonders
One swing and you're crowned
Knocked one out the park,
 
one catchy jingle and now
You think you fucking with me cause you sold like 300 thou
Bitch, I can jump without my feet ever leaving the ground
Reach up, swing from a cloud
 
with 3 thousand people around
Evil and vile enough to leap in the crowd
And heave a child in a sink hole on Cinco De Mayo
When I'm sprinkled in pico de gallo
Mardi Gras beads in a towel
I just made that up
I don't know much Spanish, I'm not bilingual
But I'll show you a Mexican stand off
Between just these two amigos
Cause neither really wants to say what we're thinking out loud
But I sure as fuck think I know how rebody English, no doubt
Cause we're trying to kill each other, but lyrically
The fuck is humility? What is a real emcee?
Royce, he came up in the shit with me
Never spit that hustling shit, it wasn't a fit for me
Let them adjust 'til they just get the gist of me
Just not giving a fuck and plus with the history
Of muscular distrophy, it wasn't a mystery
Why this middle finger was stuck in this upward positioning
So what in the fuck is a list to me?
I'm used to not being on it, I expect it out 'em
Heck wit' em, I get my respect without 'em
Ain't really been into diamonds since I put my first record out
But I could put a chain around my second album
And wear it as a neck medallion
Became a millionaire, went downhill from there
Became civil,
 
office swivel chair, sterling silverware
Screaming life is still unfair til I get a real career
The fuck am I gonna do until then?
 
This job is too fulfilling
Two gazillion pairs of super villain shoes to fill in
And a mood to kill till I plow my Coupe de Ville
To some children at the food pavilion and Build-A-Bear
Warrior's mind,
 
I’m pro-hydrocodone euphoria
In the drug emporium line, I'm soaring
I'm pouring Vicodin four at the time ignoring the warning signs on 'em fore I go four wheeler driving
Gory and violent and horrifying
You surely won't find no one more appalling
Than I am with this retaliatorial rhyming for Gloria Steinem
But I finger her like a witness, show me a line-up
I usually am abusive, but excuse me, ma'am
I guess I must've threw you for a loop like toucan Sam
When I said I could use the sample cause you'se a tramp
But look how you react to this trigger like
When I call you a bigger dyke than the Hoover Dam
You playing right in Lex Luthor's hands
It's such a ruthless plan, might even lose a fan
But fuck it, Superman wouldn't change in a phone booth for Stan
I'm a brand new being like Grand Puba's band
Happy as Anderson Cooper having a tuba crammed
In his pooper with lubricant...wait, that's too... I can't
Since honesty is the best policy I'll give you the old college try
Try to acknowledge my mistakes, probably won't qualify
As a gentleman and a scholar, but it's time that I swallow pride
And say that I'm sorry, sorry that I can't apologize
I think of all them times I compromised my bottom lines
And thought of rhymes that sodomized your daughter's minds
Then I'm like dollar signs
But I may fight for gay rights especially if they dyke
It's more of a knockout than Janay Rice
Play nice, bitch, I punch Lana Del Rey right
In the face twice like Ray Rice in broad daylight
In plain sight of the elevator surveillance
Til her head is banged on the railing
Then celebrate with the Ravens
Never date an assailant that self-medicates with inhalants
I meditate, but I may need a better way to escape
The aggression, rage and the anger
Cause them restraints on the ankles
Heavyweights and an anchor with handcuffs in chains
This ain't enough to contain it
But I still get the same respect as Jay if I came on
Stage in a fucking negligee everyday
 
and Liz Claiborne
Devastated from breakup with Kate Hudson
Wait slut, your friends, what are they gonna say
Cause makeup ain't gonna cover
That eye that's seven-eighths of the way shut
Peppersprayed with your face cut
Made my bank like a lay up
Off these effing skanks on the way up
Oh, bitch thinks she's heaven sent
It's evident that she ain't never been with seven inches
Yes, I said seven, I measured it
Seven inches from the floor
While I'm standing on the fourth floor balcony
At the Sheridan when I'm stretching it
Bitch, I'm a pimp so a limp dick is all you'll ever get
So if she's hesitant to get the hint
I'll bet you that I get the message sent who she's messing with
Hella quick
 
when I tell a chick not to never use sex as a weapon
When I step in and beat the wretched wench with a
 crescent wrench
Existential detriments to a lesbian devil
In the unpleasant stench of an estrogen level
That separatists like a Chechnian rebel
Impressionist with a pencil
A pessimist, with his lips pressed against
The edge of this Red Bull
Pedal to the metal I'm rippin' this shit cause right away I'll give it to a bitch like a pedestrian, deadly as ever
You see what kind of effects she has on the opposite sex when I push her flexible little sexy ass through a plate of plexiglass
SHADYXV
 as perplexing as
The last fifteen years and I'm predicting my next relapse
When I spit these lyrics so don't look at me weird
When I start shifting gears and shit re-smears all over Britney Spears
And these little Disney queers
Who use chicks for beards?
Just made that up too...
Oh and the Shady 2.0
We wrote it in roman numerals like they do for the Super Bowls
Cause it's supposed to confuse you hoes
The flows lose you as usual, so juvenile
2 year old when I go to the studio
It's only music but don't be foolish though
You don't know me through it ho but you can blow me to it though
In my homie's Buick
Been known to lose it though so if I overdo it you drove me to it
When I step in the vocal booth like I'm supposed to do
And I murder you on a fuckin' track like Tony Stewart
In one take, if I fuck up I don't redo it
You couldn't sound grown on a beat if you were moaning to it
The day I don't say fuck you all, you can throw me through it
Rootinest-tootinest, 
shootin' this from the hip
With the sentiments, 
Eminem isn't penning them for the women
I'm an enemy to them and the epitome of an inconsiderate idiot
But they consider me equivalent to chlamydia
They tryna get rid of me
 
gadzooks
But I stiggity stand for the fliggity flag
Of the United States and the freedom, I distribute these raps through
And if I catch you doing anything
Hindering or prohibiting that after I give me that
Tattoo of your lips on my ass I'mma be literally
Pickin' up and deliberately whippin' the Statue of Liberty at you WOOOOH!
Fuck it
Got it somewhere in there probably

Who the fuck wanna get it on? [pig squealing]
Get shitted on, ten minutes long [loud chainsaw]
Oh fuck! [various violent butchering]
Get shitted on, ten minutes long
A few minutes featured, then they gone
[gradually fades to a live performance]
Fuck rap, I'm not dealin with it
I carve kindness on a bullet, and kill you with it
Your mom's a slut [mic gets cut off, weapons sound]
[people screaming as a chainsaw revs up]
[gunshot]
What is an emcee?
An emcee, is a soldier
Who never backs down from any challenge
From any cypher
Well this is the title that was given to us
Slaughterhouse - no fake emcees allowed

[Eminem]
I fucking hate you, I can't stand you
I'll rip your titties off, and them, I'll hand you
You're ugly, you won't hug me, you're dumb, you're stupid
I'm fat, lazy and crazy, you think I'm Shady?
I am Shady
, 
you stupid bitch
Take your silicone implants
, now you gotta 
Slim chance
 of
Fuckin' with me ever again
I got your silicone, you can't fuck with me
But I'm still alone, in my cell, mad as hell
Might as well give you some more shit to sell
Fuck!

[Intro: 2Pac Talking]
I wanted to bring back that reality
But nobody can ever be confused and think I'm fuckin Mike Tyson
And I'm the heavyweight champion, I'm a little nigga
That's why its so raw to just watch me battle lions
Cause I'm a little skinny nigga battlin' niggas three times my size
Watch this uppercut, here it comes..
Watch the jab nigga...ugh...here it come
Look out, watch my arms..
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now see so many motherfuckers wanna take a piece
Commin' equipped with some shit that niggas just can't believe
I pull a trick from my sleeve now kamikaze
I'm all over that nigga, come identify the body
My middle finger to you ho niggas
Run up on me, and I'll be forced to let it go nigga
I ain't the one you wanna try, why, stayin' high
I hit this blunt and watch these motherfuckers die
Whose runnin these streets I said that cocaine
Cause in the dope game, niggas'll die 'fore they go broke mayne
Another hustler makin' major cash
'til the punk police come an raid ya ass
Now you stressed doin' fed time
And its a bitch cause the judge gave you 8 years
You doin 6 and we know that you can't hang
You a trick rolled over turned snitch like a bitch
[Hook: 2Pac]
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin from the uppercut, fucked, so what's up? nigga!
Now you know you shoulda ducked nigga
Gotchu fallin' from this uppercut, stuck, so what's up? nigga!
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
They got a nigga in the dice game
I'm feelin' lucky but the nigga just a little bigger
He tryin fuck me out my cash, ima blast nigga
He don't know I gotta tell ya like the last nigga
Gotta go don't need to roll for the truck, I get 'em up
Left to right, my uppercut'll hit 'em up (ha)
I'm known to walk the streets on any block
I love my niggas, but I ain't puttin down my Glock
The gun shots rang when I lose nigga, and ooh nigga
Ima show you not to ever play a true nigga (haha)
Lay it down just to prove it
And fuck the rappin motherfucker we can do this
[Hook]
[Verse 3: E.D.I. and Young Noble of the Outlawz]
They claim that we violent, we named after tyrants
This revolution won't be televised, we keep it silent (shh)
Roll on our enemies, beat 'em at they own game
Molotov cocktails, release an up in flames
Tired of bein' stepped on, sick of bein' held back
Lookin' through my rear view, thinkin' bout the pay back
Wanna see my kids grow don't know if ima make it though
One more nigga came up short in the ghetto
Society lied to me so I'm strapped with the metal
Push ya middle finger up nigga if you a rebel
Have ya face down goin' in ya pockets if ya let em'
I done lost too many homies for me to ever forget em'
I done made so many mistakes but still I don't regret em'
I'm a product of the pimp, the pusher, and the reverend
I'm a product of the block, the fiends, and the felons
We all lost souls tryina find our way to heaven
[Hook]
[Outro: E.D.I. Talking]
To all the comrads no longer with us, see you when we get there
'Pac, Yak, we gon' keep on ridin', give these cowards the uppercut
'Til we get up there with y'all, YOU KNOW!
Thug Life we still livin it
Outlaw for life, in the name of the Don, let's go!

[Intro: Eminem]
Only reason I dissed you in the first place
Is cause you denied seeing me, now I'm pissed off
[Eminem]
Sit back homie relax
In fact grab a six-pack
Kick back while I kick facts
Yeah Dre, sick track
Perfect way to get back
Wanna hear something wick-wack
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back
I'm Obsessed now, oh gee
Is that supposed to be me
In the video with the goatee
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out
Bitch shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out
You made to my house when you was
 
Wild'n Out before Nick
When you was on my dick and give you something to smile about
How many times you fly to my house
Still trying to count
Better shut your lying mouth if you don't want Nick finding out
You probably think cause it's been so long
If I had something on you I woulda did it by now
Oh on the contrary,
 
Mary Poppins
I'm mixing our studio session down
And sending it to mastering to make it loud
Enough dirt on you to murder you
This is what the fuck I do
Mariah it ever occur to you
That I still have pictures
However you prefer to do
And that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm
 
scurred
 
of you
You're gonna ruin my career you better get one
Like I'mma sit and fight with you over some
 
slut bitch cunt
That made me put up with her psycho ass over six months
And only spread her legs to let me hit once
Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky
Tell the public that I was so ugly
That you fucking had to be drunk to fuck me
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick, Pumpkin
The second week we were dry humping
That's gotta count for something
Listen, girly, surely you don't want me to talk
About how I nutted early cause I ejaculated prematurely
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling
And said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling
Or maybe you do,
 
but if I'm embarrassing me I'm embarrassing you
And don't you dare say it isn't true
As long as that song's gettin airplay I'm dissin' you
I'm a hair away from getting carried away and getting sued
I was gonna stop at sixteen, that was thirty-two
This is thirty-four bars, we ain't even third of the way through
Damn Slim, Mariah played you,
 
Mariah who
Oh did I say whore Nick, I meant a liar too
Like I've been going off on you all this time
For no reason
Girl you out your alcoholic mind
Check your wine cellar
Look at the amounts of all the wine
Like I fucking sit around and think about you all the time
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme
But fuck it now I'm bout to draw the line
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find
On an episode of Cribs, I blow below the ribs
If I hear another word so don't go opening your jibs
Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs
I ain't sayin this shit again, ho you know what it is
It's a warning shot,
 
'fore I blow up your whole spot
Call my bluff and I'll release every fucking thing I got
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top
When me and Luis were trying to stick two CD's in the same slot
[Interlude: Mariah Carey]

{I love you}
I love you, too
Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear, boo
Now what you say
{It's nothing}
Yeah so what I'll do is refresh your memory when you said
{I want you}
Now should I keep going or should we call truce
{You think you're cute, right}
You bet your sweet ass I do
{I'm Mary Poppins, B}
And I'm Superman, ooh
{Mary P - Slim Shady}
Coming at you
So if you'll still be my {baby girl}
Then I'll still be your {superhero}
{Oh and Em}
Yeah, I'm right here
{You like this}
Nope, not anymore dear
It cuts like a {knife} when I tell you get a {life}
But I'm moving on with mine
Nick, cause that's your {wife}
Well tell her to shut her mouth then I'll leave her alone
If she don't {stick to the script} then I'mma just keep going
Damn
[Outro]
{I see Mary Ann, Mary Ann's saying cut the tape
Cut the tape, knife}

[Intro]
Yeah... Uh!
Lil Drift
Take three
Yo!
[Verse 1]
Once more, yeah I’m back on the map
I’m ready to spit another verse for this collection of tracks
Y’all don’t really know why I do this crap
Why I spit on beats and why I shit on raps
Why I flow in a rhythm you ain’t ever heard
Manipulate the English language and I twist every word
Why I flow in metaphors that you don’t comprehend
So you say my rhymes are simple when really you’re just lame
Nosy ass fucks, keep your nose out of my business
My name out your mouth, and your eyes off of my riches
I’m a veteran in the game, you just a new recruit
That’s why you’re after my rhymes like a hot pursuit
I was schoolin kids when my flow was still off
So sick, I could take you out with only one cough
I don’t affiliate with half of these actors
Cuz they’re a talentless bunch that call themselves “rappers”
The other half a bunch of no good liars
Bragging about money and about being suppliers
When they can’t even pay their own damn light bill
Sleeping on the floor and can’t wake up from that nightmare
I’m The Watcher of the game, put out their misery
I been dominating rhymes since 2003
I got stripes like Cincinnati
And to stop me, I guess you have to try and kill me
Or something,
 
cuz my reign in the game will never cease
I lay rappers out like my Nikes when they crease
Toe tag and body bag whenever they want peace
Because instead of peace, I pull out a piece
Hip-Hop is unhealthy, it’s become obese
I feel it slowly falling apart, piece by piece
The decrease of intelligence is extravagant
Because these idiots’ numbers are set to increase
What I write might be the best you’ve ever heard
Depending on who you ask and nowadays what’s preferred
Don’t pretend to be the best, I could never act
I just vent on paper and let it flow in raps
Royaltie about to show you what’s really good
Don’t get it twisted, just get it understood
It’s the watcher
[Hook] (Truth Hurts)
I know, you got your eyes on me, I feel you watching me
But it ain't hard to see that you can't see me
You try, but what you think you saw, ain't what you thought you saw
You better off not looking at all
(Everywhere that I go, ain't the same as before
People I used to know, just don't know me no more
But everywhere that I go, I got people I know
Who got people they know, so I suggest you lay low)

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Things just ain't the same for psychos
Guns and rifles, sharp knifes, I like those
I might just O.D. by the end of tonight's show
With the right dose
 
I might wipe out this life pole
But, the strangest things can happen from jabbin'
Pregnant women in the abdomen so they can't have children
Bitches get slapped up and drastic ass kicks
Gay-bashin' fags with tire irons and ratchets
I seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Versace "Whoa, hey!" Liberace "ho!" (echoes)
I might have bashed of somebody you probably know
Buncha' faggots in your crib screamin' "It's not me! No!"
Drag 'em out the closet and across the floor
When you paid 'em a visit in the hospital
Stab 'em in the fuckin' tonsils with a popsicle
Stick, and sit back and watch 'em choke
Cause every chair that I throw
People sue me for dough
They press charges on me
Till I can’t fight anymore
But every girl that I choke
I got lawyers I know
Who got judges they know
So I suggest you stay home
Ha ha

Damn bitches, I just took some ecstasy
I'm an extraterrestrial lesbian
 with a...
Ha ha
Cut that shit off, I'm outta here, peace

[Produced by Eminem]
[Intro]
...man whatever
Dre, just let it run
Ayo turn the beat up a little bit
Ayo, this song is for anyone...fuck it
Just shut up and listen,
 ayo
[Verse 1]
I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be
The most meanest MC on this, on this Earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve
All this tension dispensing these sentences
Getting this stress that's been eating me recently off of this chest
And I rest again peacefully
But at least have the decency in you
To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out
In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter
To not come and speak to me, I don't know you and no
I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick
If you tempt me my tank is on empty
No patience is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you 10 feet in the air
I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe
I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean
But that's all I can be is just me
[Hook]
And I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
Radio won't even play my jam
Cause I am, whatever you say I am
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am
In the paper, the news every day I am
I don't know it's just the way I am
[Verse 2]
Sometimes I just feel like my father
I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense it's constant
And, "oh, it's his lyrical content
The song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses"
And all of this controversy circles me
And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie
Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up
With the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too
When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school
And they blame it on Marilyn
 
and the heroin
Where were the parents at and look where it's at
Middle America, now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city
Havin' this happening
Then attack Eminem cause I rap this way
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire
To burn and it's burning and I have returned
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I'm so sick and tired of being admired
That I wish that I would just die or get fired
And dropped from my label
, 
let's stop with the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name Is"
And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation
To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations
And I just do not got the patience
To deal with these cocky Caucasians who think
I'm some wigger who just tries to be Black
Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls
So they always keep asking the same fucking questions
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in
The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how
'til I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out
Cause they drivin' me crazy
, 
I can't take it
I'm racing, I'm pacing, I stand and I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get
But I can't take a shit in the bathroom without someone standing by it
No I won't sign you an autograph
You can call me an asshole I'm glad cause

[Verse 1 - K. Jayz]
Y’all know me, still the same low-key
Producing that heat
Hated on by niggas who don’t know me, know rap, or know that I’m tryna proceed
So no, don’t you go overdosing on he
 who gives you garbage to listen to
I’ma turn him into roast beef
I know what it’s like to be stabbed in the back
And as a matter of fact
It’d usually be the people that I thought was close to me or that know me
Y’all think I’ma let it go? Please
Ho, please
You better never even come close to me
Think about it, if we not fam, then what the fuck are supposed to be?
Do you remember Eazy-E, Ice Cube, D.O.C
Snoop D-O-double-G, and the group with that Doctor D-R-E?
I remember back in the day when all music really used to be good
And when you first heard this song by Dr. Dre, you know that you had to press repeat
Damn, it’s really getting lonely as I’m sitting here at the top
Are you gonna rock the mic forever?
Cause if you do, you have change your strategy
Cause you making music about bullshit
How you just gon’ abuse it? Hip hop?
Y’all motherfuckers really forgot about real ass music
[Hook x2 - Eminem & K. Jayz]
Now-a-days everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say
But nothin' comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch'a gibberish
You stupid motherfuckers really forgot about R.A.M
[Verse 2 - K. Jayz]
So what do you do about niggas who wanna hate on real music that was made back in the day?
That is tragic, give ‘em classics, from the Illmatic, or the N.W.A
I don’t give a fuck if you do not agree, cause it really don’t matter to me
You are a disease to hip hop everywhere
Ain’t nobody even want you to succeed
When did rap become about money and cars and clothes and jewels?
It’s funny that you think that shit is cool
But then you wanna go and act like a fool
Money’ll make you do stupid things
Like buy a ho an engagement ring
You start to show your buffoonery
When you rap for the money and the jewelry
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up with bad music and call it rap
If this was back in the day, you really would not get a say
Cause you’ll give everybody heart attacks
And we ain’t having that
This is the decade of real rap
So go ahead and give it back to real rappers
As a matter of fact, do not bother to continue to rap
[Hook]

[Hook - Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit, you already know
The question is just how far will this go?
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
Shady
 
man, I done told you once homie to easy up
But you just won’t listen will ya? Nah, I guess not
You just can’t can ya? Man, I can’t stand ya
You’re rotten, what you plottin’ for us?
Man, when are you gonna let up?
I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better
[Eminem - Verse 1]
Holy Toledo
, 
it’s Angelina Jolie, amigo
She told me "
Yo, Shady just hand your penis to me, I’ll deep throat
."
And 
Brad
 
if you try to stand between us then we’re gonna see
, bro
Who was a fantasy. I don’t mean to damage your
 
ego
You faggots wanna 'rassle?
I shove a fucking jar of Vaseline up inside your asshole
And rope it shut with a lasso
Couple of crushed Lexapro broken up with the capsule or paxil
Just in case I ain't dope enough with the raps, though
Coke is cut with tobacco
Smoke it up, then go wacko
This is what happens when you mix a coconut with Tabasco
Shady let go, the ho has been choked up enough
Let her ass go
Not till Jessica Simpson lets go of the tuna casserole
I used to love her hooters now Carmen Elektra's cuter
Strap an extension cord to her arm and electrocute her
I’m off my fucking meds
, but I’m on an electric scooter
I might just scoot by and 
shoot my mum in the neck
 with 
rugers
Spit in Jason's face while I vomit on Freddy Krugar
They can’t even get Jeffrey Dahmer to pet the cougar
Now I’m gone get the rectal thermometer, get the lubra-
Cation and get the patient some 
Darvocet
 to chew cause...
[Hook - Eminem]
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
How far will he take it?
And when will he stop?
[Hook - B.o.B]
B.o.B I done told you once homie to easy up, jeez
There’s no need to say shit you already know
The question is just how far will this go
Cause I will never lay down
And I will never let up
(I guess things are gonna get much worse ‘fore they get better)
[B.o.B - Verse 1]
With the soul of a Shaman
I leave the beat then vomit
Like a bulimic woman with an uneasy stomach
I pass by people on the street they seem like sheep and zombies
Stiffer than a therapeutic pair of jeans you run in
So can you hear me coming
Eminem this beat is absolutely disgusting
It’s probably got diseases on it
I’m just being honest, I can see the 
comets
I can see the evolution as we creep up on it
I put that music in your veins like a needle junkie
Shit I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money
I'm diarrhea on track so it needs plunging
Somebody tell these girls please release my undies
Nobody really understands my language
I find it complicated just to hold a conversation
But still I got a whole lot of patience
Sittin’ back watching Earth from my Space station
[Hook - Eminem]
[Eminem - Verse 2]
Oh my gosh I put 
Natasha Bedingfield in a washer
Watch it go from rinse to spin cycle
It's like I got ya hypnotizing like I gotcha
My God, ya psychologically fucked
Michael would like an apology, what?
Tell that psycho to stick a Tyco and a white tricycle up his butt
And glue the seat of bicycle to his nuts
I’m as cold as a muthafucking icicle on my nut
I ain't nuttin’ nice,
 
man I like to pull knives and I like to cut
The poster addict for post traumatic stress
I guess this is the most dramatic I’ve been in a while
This is the closest that it's come to the Marshall Mathers
I can hear him start to gather
I don’t paint the portrait of the picture perfect Partridge family
This ain't your orphan Annie, no this is more uncanny
Kick down Dakota Fanning's front door while the whore is tanning
(He can’t say whore)
Of course he can, man he just saw her fanny then
 
murdered her
While he danced around the room and wore her panties
[Hook - Eminem]

[Eminem]
It's all bad now man, it's all bad
But y'all done FUCKED up now
YEA! Ha ha, new shit, aiyyo
I just want the whole world to know
That I did not start this,
 
but I will finish it
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was
If you could spit, then you could spit
That's it, that's what it was
Back when, motherfuckers was straight backpackin'
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap
For the mic to get past
, and you psyched and you gassed
Then you hype, cuz you last
And you might whoop some ass
If you lost, then you lost
Shake hands like a man
 
and you swallowed it
When the Unsigned Hype column in 
 was like
Our only source of light
When the mics used to mean something, a four was like
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit
Four and a half or five
Means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas, or Benzino
Shit I don't even think you realize
You're playing with motherfuckers' lives
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic
Probably cause I was on it
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breath to get a five
Shit I was right, I'da fuckin died already tryin
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too
*Hock spit*, fuck a relationship we through
No more Source for street credit, them days is dead
Ray's got AKs to Dave Mays's head
Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head
That I am not afraid of this fuckin waste of lead
On my pencil,
 
for me to write some shit this simple
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed
This 
old G's
 about to 
get smoked like rolled weed
You don't know me or my motherfucking mother
You motherfucking punk
Put me on your fuckin cover just to sell your little
Sell-out mag
, 
I ain't mad, I feel bad
Here's an ad
, 
here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad
You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about, yea?
Let's talk about how you're puttin your own son out there
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old
No wonder you're sore now, lordy you're bored now
I'm pushing 30, you're kickin 40's door down
Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables
But you know that you'll always see me
On your TV, cuz you've got to stay up 'til
3 in the morning to see your video played once on BET
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh?
 
Aftermath
, yea
So on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks
We'll never fold or hold back
, 
just know that
Benzino's wack, no matter how many times I say his name
He'll never blow jack
You're better off tryin to bring RSO back
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back
It's extortion
, 
and Ray owns a portion
So half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston
Bullyin and bossin Dave like a slave
They completely brainwashed him and forced him to stay
Locked in his own office
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York
And it's pitiful, cuz I would have never said shit if you'da
Kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?
Hit it Clue, spit it Slay, new shit, exclusive
Yo 
Lantern
, yo 
Whoo Kid
, 
you know what to do with this
Use it, 
I'm through, 
this is stupid
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this
And who are you callin a bitch? Bitch!
You OWE me

[Hook:]
[Skam]
Yo, I'm tryin' to be the man of the day
Three six five a year
See the bullshit you sayin', Skam ain't
Tryin' to hear (Fuck that!)
Bustin' lyrics in the air
Keepin' some up in the chamber
[Eminem]
Yo Skam, what the fuck you doin'?
[Skam]
Man, I'm releasin anger!
[Eminem]
I'm tryin' to be the illest of the day
Three six five a year
See that bullshit you sayin', Shady ain't tryin' to hear
Spittin' lyrics in your ear
Keepin' some up in the chamber
[Skam]
Aiyyo Shady what the fuck you doin'?
[Shady]
I'm releasin' anger!
[Skam]
Man I'm tired of bein' tired,
 
everytime I wake up
Tired of these fake ducks, tired of bein' late for the bus
Tired of all be blendin',
 
and endin' up datin sluts
So my facial expression stay stuck up, and shut the fuck up!
To the pity ass rappers, that ain't
Shit with out make-up, wake up
Gold diggin' bitches, the buck stops here
The road to riches is closed for repair
So if the shoe ain't fittin, girl leave that shit alone
You ain't Erykah Badu, what I look like Tyrone?
I rip your tissue out your ear
Spittin' like I don't care
My hair look like I ain't comb it, shit a damn near year
So I burn, zig-zag,
 I leave the next man with his heels up
Brain dead, 
and be reincarnated at a speed bump
When we done we stay hard, so you don't land shit
Suck Skam's dick, off of what a dead man spit
Yo that's it, I don't plan shit, you know how we go down
They need to slow down, and take a look who the ho now
At every industry party, gettin' so damn drunk
Can't remember the last ass you kissed, or dick you sucked
Remind me of my ex, in the street got me veck
Tryin' to roll up on Miami, leavin' with a broke neck
Oh shit, lethal lyric equal land mind
I be stackin' up white rappers like I'm throwin' gang signs
And I'm, buck wild exposin' the plain truth
You couldn't mess with me, fuckin' shit up in the same room
Hey you, I don't know you but fuck it, let me get a dollar
For this bad car, that go along with the breath
Some show the mad bomb, and steal the show like a theft
Cause in Miami, the baby jammin' like three up in the chamber
(Yo Skam what the fuck you doin?)
[Hook]
[Eminem]
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit changed
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name
Became late to the last show with a different dame
Brain ate from the last "O" that I snifed off 'caine
You know you're spaced the fuck out like George Lucas
When your puke is turnin' to yellowish-orange mucus
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English
Freak genius, too extreme for the weak and squeamish
Burn you alive till you screamin' to be extinguished
Cause when I drop the science
Motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence
Start a fire and block the hydrants
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin'
You gettin' spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin'
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version
Stoppin' your short life while you're still a teen virgin
Unless you get a kidney specialist and a spleen surgeon
In the best hospital possible for emergency surgery
To try to stop the blood from your ruptured sternum internally
I'll take it back before we knew each other's name
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mother's frame
I'll take it further back than that
Back to Lovers' lane, to the night you were thought of, and
Cock-block your father's game
I'll plead the fifth like my jaws were muzzled
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle
And when I'm down with ten seconds left in the whole bout
I'mma throw a head-butt so hard, I'll knock us both out
[Hook]

[Intro]
Right about now, you're 'bout to be possessed
By the sounds of Slaughterhouse
[Hook: Eminem]
She strips to get tips
Those lips
 
and those childbearing hips
I'll throw this, I'll throw this dick on you, girl
I'll throw this, I'll throw this dick on you, girl
Gonna make you feel me if I gotta shake this building
'til I make you spill drinks, girl
This whole building is probably filled with lil' ding-a-lings
But not me, now I'll throw this dick on you girl
I'll throw this, I'll throw this dick on you girl
[Verse 1: Royce da 5'9"]
They call me Nickle Nina a.k.a. "Royce" a.k.a. "Throw That D"
A player gotta keep a condom on cause we play it safe, ay
Then I'm, taking the condom off cause I, skeet they face
Then I turn off Jodeci cause they say “Baby want you to stay but you can’t stay”
It ain't tricking it if you gettin it, if you ain't got that you ain't ballin’
You mad, they call me botox up in Hermes cause I help them get rid of all those bags
(All those bags) I throw this brick on you girl
Then I drink up, what's your number? I’ma throw this dick on you girl
[Bridge]
(Ay, girl clap that)
She’s got it
Oh, she got all the homies in here, excited
Oh, I don't really know how to describe it
[Royce da 5'9"]
The strippers love me and I love them too
My bitch be like what am I gon do witchu
All I know is that I got a thing for her
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
I’m Crooked I a.k.a. Fuck Your Girl
 
(Throw that D)
Up-up in the sky, when it come down, say (Fuck the World)
These strippers are sprung
My middle initial is R for Richard
And my nickname's right on the tip of her tongue
The side of her mouth is dripping with egg
I’m drunk right now, stumped right now,
 
tryna figure out how
To get four chicks to sit on one chair? Oh, yeah, turn the chair upside down
Upside down, I throw this grip on you girl
Talking that handcuff you ain't never coming home, man finna trip on you, girl
[Bridge]
[Crooked I]
Baby, you got some incredible skills
I want brain, you want shoes
True love’s always head over heels
[Hook]
[Bridge: Eminem]
I said yo, yo
You got me on a string, I'm dangling like a yo-yo
You string me along and leave me hanging and that's a no-no
In my world, cause I'll throw this dick on you girl
[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Look, they call me Joe Butt-in,
 
I be around when them hoes strut in
This relationship is 50/50, if you meet me halfway I get the whole nut in
Cause I’m in town, just one day now spin round, get your face out the way
And just when she want an encore, I’m gone, I’m sorry, I couldn’t stay
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
And they call me O-E double-L Ortiz,
 
a.k.a.
 
Yaowa
A.k.a. ah, nothing,
 
I just got an AK in my jeans, can I spray your flower?
I ain't really trying to sit with you, girl,
 
when you finish that spit let's split
Where's your wrist let me throw this grip on you girl
[Bridge]
[Joell Ortiz] (Joe Budden)
Before this night is a blur
Here’s my offer, (that shit you did, do that with her)
And both of you girls report like
[Hook]

[Intro]
Hahaha, right
Thug for life, nigga
Can't you read the signs?
[Verse 1]
Mobbin' like a motherfucker
, stuck
Can you picture middle finger out the window gettin' fucked of - liquor
Get loaded, can't control it
Nigga pass me the blunt and let me roll it
You get the bozack to the ho-stack, that's fo' sho' black
So be a mack and keep ya dough fat
And tell me what does it take to be a G?
I started with a quarter ounce, soon bounced to a ki'
You gotta watch your back, stay strapped, be alert
Started as a young motherfucker doin' dirt
And now I'm in the rap game, like the crack game, I got enemies
Can't pretend to see my friends are not my enemies
And even thug motherfuckers wanna have fun
Stuck in
, buckin' my motherfuckin' Magnum
What does it take to be a G?
Silence is a must, violence is a plus, bust
Shots at my adversaries, them niggas scurry
Pick a spot to be buried cause I'll be buckin' in a fuckin' hurry
[Hook]
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
Shootin' crooked ass cops let me fry
Do or die, to my brothers in the penitentiary
Raise hell, when them niggas mention me
(x3)
Thug for life, high til I die
When them stupid-ass bitches ask why, tell 'em
[Verse 2]
Game thicker than most of these tricks
I got my mind on makin' money but you stuck on these fake, bitches
And jealous motherfuckers can't see
That's it's the fame that causes these stupid bitches pass the pussy free
So tell me why you sweat a motherfucker like me
A young nigga tryin' to hustle up some G's
You pussy-ass playa hatin' hoes
Freakin' down on niggas, jumpin' around at the shows
And you the first motherfucker to jump
To the trunk when it's time for funk, little trick-ass punk
Thug motherfuckers don't die
We get high and we multiply, motherfucker
Give a holla to my niggas in the Bay
I'm livin' in L.A., still clutchin' on my AK
[Hook]
[Outro]
Thug for life, beyatch!
Yeah nigga, THUG LIFE, from now until for motherfuckin' forever
Have-nots in this, motherfucker

Hahahaha, man you crazy
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
See, it ain't easy bein' me
Life as a celebrity is less than heavenly
I got these fakes and these backstabbers chasin me around
And it's always drama, whenever I wanna get around
Momma told me, long before I ever came up
Gotta be true, to what you do and keep the game up
Cause thangs change, and jealousy becomes a factor
Best friends at your wife's house, tryin to mack her
I'm on tour, but still they keep on knockin at my door
And I got no time to worry, I'm steady wantin more
Every day is a test yes
, 
I try hard
But I'm strugglin with every breath
, 
I pray to God
That the woman that I left at home, all alone
There ain't nothin like tryin to bone, over the phone
In my mind I can see her naked, I can't take it
Got me shakin at the thought that we can make it
I torture me
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
I'm rollin out on tour today, you gettin sad cause I'm goin away, the...
... chickenheads wanna play with me, you gettin mad cause you think I'mma sway
Some of 'em cute some of 'em fine as fuck
I hear 'em scream soon as I hit the stage, nah...
Still I be gettin lonely for you
I'm comin home soon as I make this pay, make this pay
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
I call you up long distance, on the telephone
Wanna tuck you in even though I can't make it home
I whisper thangs in your ear like you're near me
Wonder if you feel me, from far away, and can you hear me?
It seems to me, that you're jealous
Cause I'm hustlin and makin money, with the fellas
In the backstreets, tryin to track me, baby hold up!
Thugs get lonely too, but I'm a soldier
And there's no way I'mma stop makin money
Cause your attitude's changed and you're actin a little funny
Always complainin, sayin we don't spend time
Can't you see I got enough stress on my mind?
And hangin up like you all that
Then get mad when I tell you that I'm busy baby, call back
Please, ain't nothin left to say to you
Thugs, get lonely too, YOU KNOW
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
I sit alone in my room drinkin, without a care
Talkin out loud to you, like you're there
Take your picture out my back pocket, man it's on
You're the first face I wanna see, when I get home
Wanna love you 'til the sun rise, buckwild
Touchin every wall in the house, thug style
Put your hands on the headboard, think of me
Drippin sweat on top of you, sink and see
This in yo' head that I'm makin love, so turn the lights down
Reminisce and relax, cause baby right now
I feel it in the middle of my stomach
You whisper in my ear and baby tell me how you really want it
Hold on tightly, watch the ceiling
Scratch my back's how you react, let me know you feel me
Cause everything I'm givin to you, is so true
And thugs get lonely too, YOU KNOW
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
[Outro: 2Pac]
Yeah, thug life baby!
Steady thuggin
Ay so you remember that next time you sweatin me when I'm on the road baby
Thugs get lonely too, we ain't gotta go through all this bullshittin ass problems
If you wanna be real with me, be real with me
If you wanna be fake, move on to the next one, that ain't me
YOU KNOW

Yo yo yo yo yo (this is)
This is my motherfucking anthem (hip hop)
To hip hop music (anthem)
Cause I'mma keep doing hip hop music
Until the day that I die (aight bitch)
Yo I'm into voodoo, tarot cards and 
Ouija boards
Lighting candles camping out at haunted beach resorts
I write the dark shit, and rap about perverted violence
Ghost stories of people murdered on deserted islands
Dressed in jean shorts, high tops and tube socks
Holding a rifle, with a life full of drama like 2Pac's
Jumping off roof tops drunk after I do shots
Landing in someone's backyard getting chewed up by two
 
rots
I got a new watch and two rings with huge rocks
This rap shit got cash coming out the blue like nude cops
I use to sell pizzas, now I got twelve visas
So tell Jesus that I'mma quit sinning when hell freezes
[Hook]
That's why my brain is out of order
That's probably why my nights are getting colder and my days seem shorter
But as the world turns and I keep growing older
I'll be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
Bitch till hell freezes over
I'll be living this hip hop till hell freezes over
And as the world turns and I keep growing older
I'll be living this hip hop till hell freezes...over
Yo I use to be too heavy in that cruising Gratiot crap
I think I fucked my head up listening to acid rap
I go to parties bumping Nasty Nas's new song
And smoke pot till I get high and stare at shit for too long
Like this weed is laced ain't it, it tastes tainted
The whole place fainted, I woke up with my face painted
Spaced out like Sci-Fi T.V
, 
"Fuck ICP, buy my cd!"
That's what I'm screaming while I'm handing out promo tapes of my debut
Telling bitches let me eat your pussy while I shave you
Ain't no shame in my game I turn the party out
Making everybody shout for the rapper with potty mouth
[Hook]
Uh, uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh
Ah ah ah ah
Uh uh uh uh 
(Dr. Dre)
Ah ah ah ah (Slim Shady)
 
(Outsidaz)

[Intro]
Cause sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, and gotta find that inner strength
And just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse
[Verse 1]
'Til I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
'til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'mma stop penning 'em
And I am not hip hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'mma stop sending 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
Til the roof comes off, til the lights go out
Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Til the smoke clears out, and my high burns out
I'ma rip this shit, til my bone collapse
[Verse 2]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get
When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes
 
Reggie,
 
Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast,
 
Jada,
 
Kurupt,
 
Nas
 
and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney,
 
Nate, hit me
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking, how not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd, how people hang on every word
I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic,
 
I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em
The track is on some battling raps
, who want some static?
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so
[Hook]
[Outro]
Until the roof (until the roof)
The roof comes off (the roof comes off)
Until my legs (until my legs)
Give out from (underneath me)
I will not fall, I will stand tall
Feels like no one can beat me

[Verse: Crooked I]
When I’m speaking, Long Beach is breathing
You could put your ear to the concrete
And hear my heart beating beneath the streets even
As my every breath deepens
You're standing on my chest that’s the reason
The sidewalk underneath your feet is even
To feel them East Side winds breezing
The broken stoplights flashing, that’s my pulse beating
Ima ghost creeping, and there’s no sleeping
No blinking my eyes no I won’t even
The city’s alive in the cold season
The temperature drops when the thoughts I’m thinking are below freezing
I pneumonia the whole region(You ain't hard)
So you thinking of leaving but nothing can (safeguard)
You from me I can reach you as soon as I (take charge)
Of the weak while they sleep deep in they dreams then I wake 'em and make'em a(braveheart)
Seed at you and I swallow the deceased because my stomach’s a (graveyard)
I eating people and beefing (thank god)
You won’t live in my city, I mean live in my body
Cause I am long beach, plus spitting's my hobby
Super sick skills got me sittin’ on big wheels
Nigga clique still the villain's willing to mix quills
Never switch reels, shits realin' to feel
Women and children’ll get killed when we ill nigga big deal
I’m sending any to sleep when you send me the beef
It’s war paint on my face like an Indian chief
I’m an identity thief I’m only leaving my enemies teeth
A homicide to identify a hideous beast
It’s ironic because I hit 'em with the prettiest piece
The way I did 'em don’t ask me is he deceased?
You niggas is meice (mince meat)
I’m white tee give me a crease
My city’s the beach
I’m dumb flow idiot speech
Strong arm gimme a piece
Long arm plenty of reach
Touch you niggas up from Philly to Greece
You don’t wanna die do you?
Soon as I pull the heat out, bullets’ll drive through you
Slugs love to eat out
The way they knock your meat out is quite a surprise to you
Stay out of a ridaz view is what I would advise to you
Cause this is COB until you kill me
I’m 44 weeks deep you niggas better feel me
FOR REAL G

[Verse 1: 50 Cent (
Tony Yayo
)]
Now don't think I won't hit you cause I'm popular (I'm popular)
I got a P90 Ruger to pop at ya (pop at ya)
Catch you slipping I'm a give ya what I got for ya (I got for ya)
My clip loaded with 16 shots for ya (shots for ya)
Ya never had a hot gun on ya waist or blood on ya shoes (blood on ya shoes)
Cause a nigga went and said the wrong shit to you (shit to you)
Homie you ain't been through (been through)
What I been through (through)
You not like me
And I'm not like you (like you)
[Verse 2: Eminem (
50 cent
)]
Till I collapse I'm spilling these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killing 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'm a stop penning 'em and
If I am Not Hip Hop Then I'm Just Not (Eminem)
Subliminal thoughts, when I'm a stop sending 'em
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not
Get the illin' to stop,
 
amoxacillin's just not (Eminem)
The criminal cop killin' hip-hop villain
Minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
Your comin' with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
Like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle
Or 
am I just a product of pop fizzing up?
For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot listen up
You bizzles forgot Slizzle does not give a fuck
[Hook: Nate Dogg (Eminem, 50 Cent, Tony Yayo)]
Till the roof comes off (yo, yo)
Till the lights go out (yo, yo)
Till my legs give out (yo, yo)
Can't shut my mouth (yo, yo)
Till the smoke clears out (yo, yo)
And my high burn out (yo, yo)
I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse (yo, yo)
Till the roof comes off (yo, yo)
Till the lights go out (yo, yo)
Till my legs give out (yo, yo)
Can't shut my mouth (yo, yo)
Till the smoke clears out (yo, yo)
Am I high, perhaps? (yo, yo)
I'm a rip this shit till my bones collapse (yo, yo)
[Verse 2: 50 cent (
Tony Yayo, Eminem
)]
I'm like a animal when I spit it's crazy (it's crazy)
Got semi-autos that put wholes in niggas tryna play me (play me)
One shot is not enough, you need at least an uzi to move me (uzy to move me)
After 4 bottles of don
The kid start feeling woozy (feeling woozy)
I write my life
You write what you've seen in gangsta movies (gangsta movies)
I'm gangsta to the core, nigga you can't move me (can't move me)
I find my space at the top
I got this rap shit locked (rap shit locked)
I've never heard of you (heard of you)
You've heard of me
, 
I'll murder you (I'll murder you)
Spit shells at your convertible (convertible)
As long as you notice (notice)
Richard Poor hallows still go through ya door
This is war (this is war)
You scared of me
Your not prepared for me
The Kid is back (Kid is back)
50 Cent, I know you like that (I know you like that)
Yeah I know you like that (50 cent c'mon!)

{*alarm clock goes off, door opens, kids playing*}

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
Nobody dead knew they would die before they woke
They probably started off a beautiful day with weed smoke
Out of last night's pussy, the murder that she wrote
Cold sweatin from a nightmare, mind on a C-note
You leave the door with intentions of fulfillin your visions
Constantly sidetracked, thinkin bout who's your man or who isn't
Maybe it's necessary - maybe you're overreactin
Maybe your actual downfall is that ho that you're clappin
Maybe your pillow conversations been controllin the actions
Maybe your homey overheard and never told you what happened
You look behind you when you turn the corner, cause death is promised
You done seen some niggas go before ya, the threats are honest
And with that lingerin in the back of your head
You know it's possible that you won't make it back in your bed
The confusion and jealousy and dishonor'll spin ya
But then none come worse than when that gunpowder's in ya
[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
If you my nigga, you my nigga til the end
Fuck a bill, fuck a bitch, fuck a Benz
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da
If you my nigga, you my nigga til we go
One of the few I would take a bullet fo'
Let's toast til we die
Roll up the weed and blow the smoke in the sky - la da da
[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
The smell of marijuana reeks off me
I raise hell 'fore I speak softly, caught in the mix
Put at least a hungred grand on one hand, bought him a 6
Acknowledged the weaknesses that his man taught him to fix
We ain't never left the hood, so we camcorded the trips
I done watched the nigga go from BET to the Bricks, shit
The slanted eyes what the chocolate thai gave me
I'm a bachelor, nigga you ain't knockin my lady
A lot of these niggas been jockin mine lately
And I hope you catch this long nap, rock-a-bye baby
We two brothers, pitched outta different mommas
Close enough to conflict and put the shit behind us
Your baby boy meet the daytime
Oldest watchin and these niggas tryin to get mine
Remember back then the lines in your flat top
Hopin your moms ain't the momma on crack rock
[Hook]
[Verse Three: Lloyd Banks]
Keep my, mind on my money, and my head to the sky
I never really smile much, if you was here you'd know why
There's frustration and fire if you look in my eye
The media fuckin me up, right hookin my high
Niggas hated on us 'fore the game took us inside
Then they opened they arms wide, took the whoopin and cried
I got a platinum plaque hangin on the wall of my crib
And handsome's one of the things they been callin the kid
They watch you close when you coppin all the VS stones
If you ain't tryin to get it poppin, leave the BS home
I got a saditty broad that gives the best dome
And I'm blowin on some of the finest weed that's grown, homes
You won't know when they gon' dump a slug
But you can tell I'm gettin money from the line out in front the club
My whole click caked up, you can't compare the dough
And if it's only one bitch, then we gon' share the ho
[Hook]
[Outro]
(
If you my nigga you my nigga til the end.. my friend
)

[Yelawolf]
Aye Boo get these motherfuckers and pass that Jack
[Hook: Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talking loud but you ain't saying shit
Get the fuck from round here, you don't rep my shit
You ain't from my city, you don't know about this
You don't want that drama, you ain't ready for it, bitch
Now throw it up, yeah ho, throw it up
Throw it up, yeah ho, you ain't ready for it bitch
Throw it up, yeah ho, throw it up, throw it up
You ain't ready for it bitch
[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I already got, two cars in the yard that don't run
So why would I wanna break shit down for you
Better me confuse with the punchlines and bars that I launch
Here the king of debauchery come,
 
with a cracker dick
To fuck you in that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one
You must be barely the one billionth
Really you kidding, bitch I'm the prodigal son
And I'm stunting like my Daddy
D-dr-d-drinking like my Mama
C-c-country like my uncles
Stuttering like a CD in a donk
BUMP, BUMP, BUMP, BUMP
And I'm in a blue Chevy
Running over motherfuckers in first
I ain't even shift gears yet
I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth
Right, yeah ho
But I just hit the surface
And I'm bout to walk into a bank
With a shank and a black can of paint to check the clerk
Where the keys
Bitch you better check your purse
I gotta brick of herb
And I hit the syrup
And I'm feeling like I might just hit the curb
So get the fuck outta my way buddy
You don't wanna run around the chicken house with a heart of a puppy dog
Yelawolf and Eminem shit
Sufferin' succotash, yeah suck a dick bitch
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Gangsta Boo]
Bitch please you don't wanna step up to this Misses
G-A-N-G-S-T-A Boo make a nigga hit his knees when
I'm up in the building, preachin' to my children
I don't be taking no shit from you haters
You'll make me hurt one of your feelings
Ha ha ha ha
Nah nah ni nah nah
Pick your face up off the floor
I got you feeling sad now
You be on that Hokiewag, Hokiewag is bullshit
Run into this Gangsta, have your preacher at the pulpit bitch
I was born on the Mississippi River
Take no shit from a bitch or a nigga
So, so crazy gotta fucked up temper
Bi-pola', not Nicki I'm worser, I'll hurt ya
I got a crazy-ass mind game
Ma nigga, I'm a lion, untamed
Hunt ya ass down in my jungle, I do this
I tell them hoes, you ain't ready for it bitch
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Me and Yelawolf
Tear the roof off this motherfucker
You ain't got the umph
You're a hoof to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent
That's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kicking my seat
And I'm trying to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole
When I pull up at the White Castle
And I ask for an appli-cation
Throw it back in her face and
Tell the bitch I'm a rapper, then I wack her
In the head with a Whopper
That I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut, ho
Skidda dee da da
Prada, not a chance
I was thinking about buying you some clothes
But Target's closed
So I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart but the doors
Was locked, what about some shoes I thought
Great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what'dya know
They didn't carry a size eight in hoes
Oh, this is ugly boy swag
Putting toe tags on you motherfucking ho bags
What a Trailer Trash pioneer
I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book it's more like a motherfuckin' diary of diarrhea
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thing or two
Bout sign language, middle fingers aimed at you
So we don't gotta scream at you
Ow, I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell em all to go get fucked
But I'm never gonna bite my tongue
Little bitch, throw it up
[Outro]
{Eminem} What the fuck is this, White dog

Yo blast me off, Tim, blast me off, son
Blastin' off right now son
I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery
I walk the streets looking for some puss to fetch me
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush, I'm edgy
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie
If he don't gimme Kim, things could get messy
So pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek
And press against the right one till it's smushed against me
And leave a dead body in the woods,
 
the MC
With the Christopher Reeve beef
We started out on the wrong foot
Or should I say fake leg made outta wood
I shouldn't, yes I should
Riding through the hood,
 
I'm chillin' with Westwood
I'm quite mellow,
 
a white fellow
My pee is bright yellow,
 
I like Jello
I'm like hello to a cute little dyke on the mic
I'm kinda like, Iron Mike cause I bite ear lobes
[Mr. Porter]
See Im the first one to class and the last to leave
I mean the first one to leave outta class, 
believe
Then Im a mailbox pimp and my heart's locked out
Even after all (inaudible) and my ass is fly
Went from an ashy guy class clown as high
To a grown ass man stacking pay par
Runyon ave's the clique , d12's the game
We've been spitting this (shit)
Since we were little bébés
Gaga goo goo nana nadi do do
 never
Word to 
my homie em
 Im just too too clever
A 4-5 shot and leave a nigger, face  lop-sided
The kick from the barrel make you think Im cock-eyed it
When I bust it out off in the crowd , you start diving
Greg Louganis went over the bar I ain't lying
Hot Iron lethals not defying soldier
Runyon ave soldier equals death when it's over
It's none colder than (a nigger) understand the struggle
Fly the street-muscle we've been had to hustle
We've been had to hustle, we've been had to muscle
Fly the street hustle, we've been had to hustle
[Eminem]
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth
Cruisin Gratiot til I damn near crash the car
Tryna smash 'em off in the dash,
 
hit the overpass,
 
went off
Over the bridge into on-coming traffic
Caused a massive forty-two car pile-up, not a scratch at all
Hopped up holding an axe and saw
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tabasco sauce
Spitting flames,
 
kickin' fire out your ass you little bitch
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdrawal
Dick so big it's like elastic
I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic
Crossed the path of Plastic Man with a
Drastic force,
 
put my penis on classic sports
[Eminem]
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady
Kryptonite to Superman, he's a dentist to Amy
Administer of the pain,
 
just finished, huffing the paint
And muffled the fumes like it was nothing because it ain't
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays
His venom he spray, reaches like beams of energy rays
Menacing stares, he glares makin' the hairs all on the back of your neck stand
Like Dracula yep
Spectacular rep,
 
he's a tarantula, gargantuan
Yah, Angela so I command you to start dancing
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical shark
Throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansen
Enter my gas chamber, ya gangsta, my ass
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater
You're facing a task greater, he's chasing your ass
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table
I'm checking the exposure, a full dose of me
Exposing myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing
Bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing
I think there's a ghost
Too much hydrocodone and Codeine
I was only supposed to swallow a half
I took the whole thing
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink posing
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, mostly
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosey
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies
Totally frozen while I close in, 
I'm yodelling
Rosey, won't you come out to play
A nuisance, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers
Making shrines of my crimes and capers
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends
Go to Europe and put neurofens in my syrup and stirred em
You never heard him like this, so don't encourage him
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, I'm lyrics worse than
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins
Crazy turn of events that he emerged, took over the world
And reeled in all the children, lured em into the building and killed em
Buried em in the mulch and mildew
 and he will do what he feels
And still can spit, 
drawn to gold like Rumpelstiltskin
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol - three pills
The Real Slim Shady's entered the building
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and
Tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid
He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be heeled
There's no one as sick as he MC's
Will get fricasseed on the grill then
[Eminem]
You wanna start with the hook first
You wanna start with the...oh
I have no idea what I'm doing, I have no idea what I'm doing, but
Everybody get up, sit up Christopher
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-
Live and he's flowin' like the Mystic River
Girl, don't act like you've never been kissed before
One, two, three, four, five, six, this uh
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser
How did anybody ever find me I disa-
Peared I was hiding in Freeway's beard,
 
just a
Hop, skip and a jump from my skin gushing
Nails into my face that I been pushing
Hellraiser, my face is my pin cushion
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a
Sucker like a vice grip, my pen put you
In the slaughterhouse cause your style's been butchered
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brains on
Hyper drive, someone put the brakes on
[Eminem & Kon Artis]
Here's a smidget, a midget to get your digits
 
Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
Now here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
[Eminem]
...Cause he gets as busy as a
Bee 
baby you could throw a Frisbee in a blizzard
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he, he's a wizard
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit
And I'm pretty sure it isn't Bisquick, is it
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick witcha
I want the kiss before
 
I blow this bitch to smitha-
Reens,
 get the guillotines, this is a situ-
Ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh
Turn tables and he cuts the record like a scissor
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka
Who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's 
six o-
Clock in the morning
 unless you want to get some dessert
[Eminem & Kon Artis]
Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I said Here's a smidgen, a midget to get your digits, Bridget
Don't try to fidget with it, ribbit ribbit
I got you slipping on my swag juice, my swag juice
I got you slipping on my swag, my swag juice
[Eminem]
Ayo, just so everybody knows
That was a hook we made on the way to the radio station
And we were trying to get it right
So we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever
But, this is what we were trying to like work out before we came here
Especially for Westwood, man, ESPECIALLY for you homie

I'm like a white Michael Vick
, psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwave with a Rott
I might make a little Alizé with a side of NyQuil
And ride a motorcycle bike right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle and a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates, what an appropriate
Way to start off his day; he may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See, 
Hannibal ate his face and met Jason gnawed off his leg
Amazing hard-on for razors and blades and anything sharp
Even poisonous darts; it 
all
 plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off, crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous; sawed the crazy part off his brain
He's still insane,
 why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane
There's some crazy shit going on in Shady's apartment again
Newsflash, I'm still trashed, them pills shoulda killed my ass
But they didn't, they just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass
, like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
It's Aftermath, bitch!
 And my milk glass is still half-empty
Yeah, tempt me! Hell isn't enough
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting, they'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done made a verse, said some foul shit
Tryna go back fix it, fucked around and just made it worse!
Yeah, I'm back, looking no worse for wear, got these haters
Mad enough to rip off their hair and start punching the air!
Panties so in a bunch that they can't function
It's Shady and Royce, fuck yeah! What a dysfunctional pair!
So stop acting like a punk, get a pair
Take a pill and fall the fuck out, spill ya lunch in the chair
I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash in the ass
With a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smart ass
Yeah, laugh while sit there thinking that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips, mane
I'll cut ya fuckin' balls off, homie, my saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fuckin' crawled off and sang
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
And took the Elephant Man's skull, fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nutsack
Gave him a reacharound while I fucked him right in his buttcrack
Nah, I ain't taking it back, faggot, fuck that!
I give a fuck about nothing so here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touching that can, man, you don't wanna open up that!
Wait a min... ah, shit... Alchemist, cut that!

[Intro]
I love niggas! I love niggas!
Cause niggas are me!
And I should only love that 'presents me
I love to see niggas go through changes (Whoooo!!)
I love to see niggas shoot through shit (Did it again)
And to all niggas that do it I love
[B.I.G.]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (You niggas understand?!)
To all my Bronx (It's war nigga)
To all my Queensbridge (I'll blow you away)
[Verse One: Notorious B.I.G.]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls grips it quick
And kicks it quick, you know how black niggas get
With the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's
Hittin' buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos
Flash the Roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga wanna act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out
That's real
[Chorus: 50 Cent - repeat 2X]
We the realest nigga
50 Cent and B.I.G. my nigga
Don't try to act like you don't feel a nigga
Biggie yo nigga, 50 yo nigga
Squeeze the trigga' leave a nigga fa' sho!
[Verse Two: Notorious B.I.G.]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case dread wanna riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the D.A. cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up North found first stop Watertown
Of fist-skill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha hahhh, yo Chief, pass the Buddha
[Chorus]
[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
When I was young my M.O. was to go hand-to-hand
And even my P.O. she called me the Ginger Bread Man
I catch a new case, and tell her ass "catch me if you can"
Don't let your people fill you up wit octane I'm not playing
Get gassed up to get blast up
Real B.I.G. style watch the kid break it down
Check it, thou shalt not fuck wit North C. Papa
50 Cent, I'll break yo ass off propa'
There's no place like home, New York - New York
I run this city, I don't dance around like Diddy
Niggas is giddy, till they act smack silly
Or spray wit the Mack Milly, they don't want drama really
Pussy niggas get hard lip syncing my lyrics like Milly Vanilly
Even the hood they feel me {*gun cocked*} hah! I'm on fire!
Niggas out in Philly they feel me, they bump my shit
Every bootlegger you know, bump my shit, bitch!
[Chorus]
The Invasion! (Invasion yeah)
Green Lantern! the infiltration, we comin'! (yeah)
[Bridge: Eminem]
I got 50 Cent, I got G-Unit
D-Tweezy in this bitch, wit Obie Trice!
So watch what you say, 'fore you call our name
Cause you say one more thing and it won't be nice!
[Verse Four: Eminem]
Whoa, here we go, I shoulda known
I was bound to get pulled into some bullshit
Sooner or later you little haters
Are too jealous of us to love us
You hate it G-Unit made it and Obie's coming
D-Tweezy's coming you're sick to your stomach
50 percent of it's 50 cent
The other 50 percent of it's who's color of skin it is
But if you even considerin' taking our label down
You better find our building and fly a fucking plane into it
But I ain't trying to get too intricate into it
I'm just trying to you give you a little hint for your own benefit
Cause then it's gonna get to the point
Where it escalates to some other shit
Then I'm a flip, then I'm a get to
"Stomping in my Air Force Ones"
But you won't be able to tell
If it's two pairs or it's one
It's just gonna feel like so many feet kicking you
You'd think Nike just made these into cleats in this shoe
I don't know what it is or what it could be
But I get a woody when these pussies try to push me
Thinking they gonna put me in a position to pickle me
Y'all tickle me pink
I think I'd just rather have Pink tickle me
Hickory dickory dock, tickety tock tickety
A little bit of the diggedy doc diggedy
Mixed with a little bit of the {*Eminem vocal scratch*}
Wit a pinch of Biggie
Look at me, I'm just the bomb diggedy
[Chorus: Eminem]
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and kill your label
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records
We the label fa' sho!
We the realest label
Don't try to act like you don't feel our label
Cause we gon' fuck around and steal your paper
Obie, D-Tweezy, G-Unit, 50, Shady records
We gon' kill your label fa' sho!
[Eminem]
Shady in the place to be see
And I got what it takes to +Roc The Mic+ right!
Still watch what you say to me punk
Cause I'm off probation in less than six months {*gun cocked*}
[Outro]
Haha, Shady Records
Still Aftermath, and don't think we don't
Hear you motherfuckers talkin'!
Cause we do and we see y'all
We just gon' sit back for a minute
While I see what the FUCK y'all do

[Produced by Mr. Porter]
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm getting mad love, I'm snuggling hugs
Struggling thugs
, 
smuggling drugs
Juggling jobs
, 
guzzling jugs
So here's a toast to federal checks
Hetero sex,
 
unaffordable medical debts
We travel in packs and ravel in facts 
and gravel in cracks
To find babbling Max gaffling tracks
I grapple an axe for them baffling acts
The mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in wax
Still in my yard when I sculpted the culprit
The tall shit that will end up with his skull split
Then I buried the hatchet
, 
I carry the fat shit
Butterfingers is here
 and it's 
necessary to scratch it
Baby, all I wanna do is swallow one or two
Smoke a little bit and follow one of you
Back home when the party ends
So tonight I'm dropping naughty hints
To the finest women in the audience
[Hook]
Cause we came here to do this tonight
We don't wanna fight, we don't want no one feelin' uptight
Cause we came here to do this tonight
'Til the mornin' light, hope that everyone's feelin' alright
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Ayo, 
biters are like tarantulas,
 
vandalous
Living as scandalous as a television evangelist
But I can handle this
, I'm the 
rhyme biter crime fighter
Caped crusader, taking care of undeserving lime lighters
I think we live in an era meant for me
Experimentally I found a way to spread
 
the terror mentally
When I stumbled upon this resolution
By using a special fusion of chemical solution for this resolution
You couldn't see me with binoculars
I'm armed like an octopus
Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed
Talking that junk like you went black, guarded your back
Come to battle me
 and 
you get smacked as hard as you act
I represent it and will have a referee in it
Every minute so when I win it you never resent it
I'm forever demented
Come up with funk: I'll never be scented
You got the point when I cleverly sent it
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Eminem is heading skyward
, for those who thought
That I would make you 
bored
 and 
treat you like a piece of plywood
I've got miracle lyrical capability all in me
With the agility to escape a killer bee colony
So get your cameras and capture how miraculous
I rap for all you Draculas and showed you all how whack you was
I meant it as a diss, cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
I'm hazardous enough already as it is
Without you adding fuel to the fire; I'm cruel to the liar
Who fails to recognize my reign of hell, rule to the sire
Clinical studies show that I'm cynical
There's no one who's identical to my fresh and authentic flow
I'm sure the party people can agree
That I'm enchanting, with the romantically
Freaking vocals so frantically
So throw your hands up in the atmosphere
And let them know the only party that was phat was here
[Hook]

[Tonya]
Hey! Hey, stop, hey. Please stop, fuck stop!
Thank God you stopped
Fuck, my fucking OnStar isn't working
I left my fucking phone at home!
God, I've been standing out here for like, an hour
I'm soaking wet, freezing
Thank you so much. Really, you're a life-saver
What are you doing?
Fucking! Get away from me! What the fuck! Fuckin asshole!
Get away from me you motherfucker! Get away!
Get away you fuckin freak! Get away from me!
Goddamit fuck! Help me!

[Verse 1: Eminem as Dr. Dre]
My motto is live by the bottle
So why is my supply low, bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded but I still reach for the sky though
Ghetto idol I think, but what do I know
Shit I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Dont act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly,
 
Mohammed Ali of rap, I don't lolly gag
West Coast, the home of the body-bag
The shotty, the Mag Los Angeles, where the party at
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back so have a cardiac
Started back with the black Raiders starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fuckin' started that
Everyday with this game I'm gettin' smarter at
Sky's the limit so everytime I get on a track
[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Guns blaze when I shine
Nigga wish quick, no startin' I'm the shootin' kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick but I ain't got no roof on mine
I drink topless, I live topless
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
I drink topless, I live topless
Sky’s the limit I’m paid to run the city now
[Verse 2: Nas]
Your skin's your travelin' bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab while mines glistenin'
Vivid on my skin how many continents I’ve visit then
You could journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shittin' on 'em, ya brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it however you want I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit the grind
My genetic code make-up, murderer by design
On mayan calendar time when night meets day
I’m in a light grey Bugatti like a high-speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger the jump in rope in place
The Muhammad Ali hobbies no pilates tryna keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man’s wife see what these hoes can buy me
Lookin' forward but it’s nice to see the road behind me
Hotel’s a seven star, baguette's glowin'
Keep your lid yet dawg the 
private jet boeing
 topless
[Hook]

[E] When 
we touch down
[Hook: E = Eminem; T = T.I.]
[T] 
In the midwest we okay
E'rybody know them southern boys love that bass
[E] Atlanta 
go bananas, Alabama
, '
weesiana
Mississippi, 
Ten-a-keys
, every mufuckin state, when we touch down
[T] 
Go right from the plane to the Range
[E] 
When we touch down
[T] 
On a private plane getting brains, till we
[E] 
Touch down, there ain't no way to keep em quiet
With T.I. and Shady baby, we bout to incite a riot
When we touch down
[Verse 1: T.I.]
When we get in town, you know how we getting down
Pull up clean, then hop on out, snatch all the freaks then walk on out
I'm living what they talking bout, shining if it dark or not
That 
one hundred E-X-double R
, you'll find that in the parking lot
You barking up the wrong tree, I do this shit for zone three
Four, five and six as well as one
, Atlanta I'm forever son
Still be on whatever coke, ridin' blowing heavy smoke
Ay Em you better tell them folk won't hesitate to let 'em go
They know I put that green light on them haters
Keep on trying me I put that beam right on ya tater (pow)
Now you don't wanna see T.I.P. outrageous
Try to keep him in a cage but somehow he keep escaping
That's why I be on vacation, 
Virgin Island I be taking
Private planes out to Spain, I keep on flying I ain't faking
The money ain't a thang, think I'm lying, you're mistaken
You can find long lines of all kinds of bitches waiting when we touch down
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Welcome to the Midwest, yes
Where them Detroit playas ball like you have no idea
The boy is here, got the whole place looking like it's 
candy painted
Ain't it like we left the kids at home and just let em loose with the crayons
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people looking like 
Frogger
They hopping out of the way whenever they see Marshall's car coming
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker
And let the rest of the car carpet color like 
swirl pops
And I got the bass thumping
 but I'm bound to bump into something
Kids are flying through the air looking like they 
krumping
The way they tumbling, I gotta do something
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off
They just right back at it tomorrow
They're like, "Dad this is in, so you're with the trends"
"This is for the pimps, listening to 
Mims
, nail polish on the rims"
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show
So go on with ya bad self, just have it back to normal when I touch down
[Hook]
[Verse 3: T.I.]
From my arrival, un-til my departure
Gurantee I put this d-i-c-k in somebody's daughter
Ay, 
I still have my way with the ladies way cross the water
Flew to Paris from Haiti, did some shit that I thought of
It's ironic that the shit that we popping makes us psychotic
Threaten corporate America, that's why they running from me
How could they be so ignorant? Look what hip-hop done brung us
It's allowed us to run a business, legitimated our moneys
Got us out of the ghettos and relocated our mommies
I made it all the way here ain't no way you taking it from me
So excuse me Oprah honey, I'm sorry, really I promise
But niggas, bitches and hoes do exist, I'm just being honest
For that am I being punished?
 Why is you so astonished?
Now I ain't got a degree, just intelligence in abundance
So you ain't gotta like me, I know billions of folks who love me
You can tell how they yelling and screaming and waiting for me when I touch down
[Hook]

[Hook]
Touch It, Bring It, Pay It, Watch It
Turn It, Leave It, Stop, Format It
Touch It, Bring It, Pay It, Watch It
Turn It, Leave It, Stop, Format It
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Oh, now you know who the God be
Back runnin' the city
And you know who the squad
Flipmode
Look see ain't nothin' changed
Back with the remix
With the Queens
(TURN IT UP!)
When you see me in the spot
Better respect each other
Y'all already know where I'm rep
Ain't no reason to check it
And I know that
You ain't messing with me
Just for the record
So instead
I'mma let Mary J. Blige
Come and set it
[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige]
(Get Low Mary)
Maybe you can guess
Who it is
Mary J. Blige, I'm 'bout to
Handle my biz
I'm on my grown woman
Still I rep for the kids
In every hood, and all my peoples
Doin' a bid
(TURN IT UP!)
Now you know
Who's really the Queen, deliver the mail
Seven Hundred Thirty Thousand
First week of my sales
The haters plot and they watch
Lookin' all pale;
While I'm on a yacht, overseas
Doin' my nails
[Verse 3: Rah Digga]
(Get Low Digga)
Now he sittin' there, lookin' stuck
He thinkin' cause he spent
A little dough, "I'm 'gon fuck."
If money ain't a thing
I'm sayin' let a chick know;
Type to empty an account
How far you willin' to go?
(TURN IT UP!)
Now he hoppin' on the jet
He ain't wasting no time
Told me all expenses paid
Any place I could find
Hit the islands in the Winter
Trickin' all on his dime
Ain't no alpha in this world
Who is better than mine
They wanna
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Missy Elliott]
I'm jinglin' baby (Go Ahead 'Mami)
Don't I look charmin'
Put your lips up on me
Kiss it, touch it, good
Yes I wish you would (TURN IT UP!)
You like to see me
When I dip, baby, dip
Don't I look like I got Beyonce's hips
Lookin' like I could be Nia Long
Boy, you smokin' that
Cheech and Chong
[Verse 5: Lloyd Banks]
I know what it feels like
I been gone for a minute
But I'm back
Chinchilla on with a fitted
Everybody talk money
Everybody gon' live it
That bowl of bread smaller
Than the arm
(TURN IT UP!)
And you know I'm doin' my thing
It's blue in the ring
If you had it like this
You probably do it the same
But you won't cause you broke
All you do is complain
After the club, I'mma put a few
In the range and let 'em
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Papoose]
Five boroughs of death
You don't understand
I got New York City
In the palm of my hand
Now I could make a tight fist
And let it crumble ridiculous
Or I could smack the world
With a New York Nemesis
(TURN IT UP!)
I got Staten Island on my pinky
Queens on my thumb, dude
The Bronx on my middle
Finger screamin' F you
Rock Ice in Manhattan
So there's the ring finger;
You know I had to keep
Brooklyn on the trigger finger
[Verse 7: DMX]
Swizz is the monster, X is the beast;
Fuckin' with Bus, everyday is a feast
Stay off the streets
I'm tired of talkin' to y'all niggas;
I'm stickin' a fork in y'all niggas
(TURN IT UP!)
When I hit 'em, man
That truck come get 'em, man
Roughed up how I did 'em, man
Ain't no remorse for the corpse, truth is
Can't I.D. the body, nigga toothless
[Hook]
[Verse 8: Eminem]
As I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up
Bring it back, come rewind
Powerful impact, BOOM on the track
Come attack (Hey Shady!)
Guess who's back
Everybody in the place
Take a look at the face
I used to be without a trace
He's a little high, ain't he
New year, Ooh yeah
Who's here, New gear
Full gear, Spookier. Aah Aah Aah!
I'm 'bout to scream at the top of my lungs
And I don't even know why
I'm screaming. 
Aah Aah Aah!
And I'm screamin' on the
Wrong part of the song
Bus, you did it again, lets turn it up more
Let's turn it up loud
Let 'em know we ain't playin'
And I don't even know
What the chorus is sayin'
(Touch It, Bring It, Babe)
Just give me the beat Bus, plus
THE BIG BANG!

[Intro: Eminem]
Big Proof, rest in peace
 
dudey
We love you, we just wanna keep making you proud
[Verse: Proof]
My life is trapped in these lines
, 
that's why I'm packin' these nines
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', 
that's in the back on my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers til I'm snappin' my spine
Naturally, I gotta focus on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like shoulder
Hold up (We nothin' but soldiers), slow up (This gun is loaded)
Roll up (They beef and we leavin' 'em coked up)
If Slim say it I spray it, if he will it I kill it
We Kilpatrick and Ilitch of Detroit, y'all can feel it
Got this gun on my wasteline, and woah we don't waste time
Ja, man he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got School Craft here at the 7, 8, and Dexter
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha ya flinch
When Proof shoot up they coup, and waste your whole clique

[Intro: Proof]
Dirty Harry is dead [x4]
I'm here to announce that Dirty Harry is dead
Now witness the life of his son, or Oil Can Harry, The Boss
[Verse 1: Proof]
My life is trapped in these lines, that's why I'm packin' these nines
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back on my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on this grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers til I'm snappin' my spine
Naturally, I gotta focus on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like shoulder
Hold up (We nothin' but soldiers), slow up (This gun is loaded)

I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha ya flinch
When Proof shoot up they coup, and waste your whole clique
Fuck it who's next on this shit, this is prefrence to bitch
When you preface to stiffen slugs enter your wig
You'll be next to BIG, Pac is destiny kid
Before ya lead get popped, stop testin' me bitch
[Hook: Proof]
Homie you think you tough (what)
Think we won't fuck you up (punk)
Even the innocent get pistol-whipped by this pistol grip (punk)
Talkin' shit you drunk (what)
Think I won't fuck you up (punk)
We both deep, I ain't scared and I don't give a fuck (jump)
[Verse 2: Proof]
I ain't feel no games, homie don't even try
We ain't bowin' down to no one we gon' start a riot (yeah)
Heart of fire, soul of ice, roll the dice, see what you get
No advice, all my life I ain't leavin' in this bitch
I'm a man, more I'm holdin' my ground
To loadin' these rounds, at any call approachin' my ground (blah)
I'm a kid but grimey, nothin' but killas
And behind me, I'm a bully fully cuz your team is tiny
If I was to crush 'em, got to say these Bibles are nothin'
This rifle on clutches to leave you stifled on crutches
I fight for my cousins that ain't even related
Even I stated, not from life I leave you bleedin' and faded
Hatin' made in my nature, I'm clappin' and clackin' your captain
Smackin' faggots and act as a rapper with platinum status, ya livin'
Flappin' 'em slappin' 'em backwards
After these rappers' status
To shadders, knowin' Proof and that Mathers has gathered an army
It's Shady bandatas
After rest the game is won, who in the matters get blamed fast with brain damage
The name that some forgot, D12, it ain't hard to feel, guard ya grill, it's REAL!
[Hook]

[Hook: Fuzz Scoota](repeat 2X)
Trife thieves we can't be trusted
Step into my clique the wrong way and get yo' motherfuckin' dome busted
We got cement shoes for all you damn snitches
We ain't just shootin' niggas, we buckin' bitches
[Verse 1: Bizarre]
My fully loaded nine will shoot through your metal door
Have ya nigga's far and out like white kids at grocery stores (AHHHH!)
Battle Bizarre and it's just too deadly
Even a rapper with amnesia who met me still couldn't forget me
If I don't get all my fuckin' dough
Y'all gonna see more fights and spits than the Jerry Springer show
Cause I'm a nasty, dirty, filthy bitch
For ten rocks even a basshead with AIDS would suck my dick
Cause I'm quick to snatch a nigga out his Polo
I'm the reason niggas come ten deep and end up leavin solo
(I'm by myself!) Meet losing ya'll niggas must be buggin
We can battle for ten minutes and let your cousins be the judges
I'm the illest rapper to come out thus far
I'll shoot anybody; even the bitch who gave me CPR
Step to the Outz and end up getting burned
Fuck around and get raped like one of Bill Clinton's interns
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'll shove a gun in ya grill, greasy and heated
Smothered in hot mustard
So when I feed it to you it's easy to eat it
You need to be immediately treated while you breathin'
Or you'll be leavin' the receivin' room this evenin' with Jesus
You hate on us and we'll be waitin' on eight corners
Swarmin' ya hood with a thousand angry skateboarders (c'mon)
I hop in a jeep, slam on the gas and charge you
And bombard you in the car that your mom bought you
Fuck around and get choked and found in a moat
Flotin around drowned face down in a boat (damn)
I'll pile five dudes in a pinto and pull up
To the 7 Mile drive-through at McDonald's and pile-drive you
I got the power to snatch a motherfucker out of his car
When he drives by me at 90 miles an hour
This place is my house I might as well erase my face with white out
Cause y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows
[Verse 3: Fuzz Scoota]
I'm dressed to please sucking nips
Yeah, she get it the same way that I fucked the chick
Stuck my hands in her panties like bitch suck my dick
87 freak 187 heat the passion rolls I'm passin' clothes
You like it in the ass is what I'm askin' hoes
Aren't you Fuzz he has sold more albums then the Jacksons sold
I love you baby if I'm not with you then I'm blastin' foes
Telepathically harrasing foes
I know your little sister is fourteen but her ass can grow
Ice-berg took down Titanic elastical
Given my fans the exact shit they askin' fo'
Fuzz Scooter fucking one man bout to show
You passing one blunt bitch we passing four
I rode your ass and smoked take one pull and smoke your head up
I'll send you to tell 2Pac to 
"Keep His Head Up"
I went to the fighting really Canibus who can get up
I knew this shit was over from the fucking blood that he spit up
Ran a couple more miles should have done more sit-ups
I want his dumb ass to jump up bitch and get lit up
Call your bitch like, "Bitch, come and pick this bitch up"
On battle you be sweeter then I get this shit up
I'll stomp you too you get up
Or stomp you to the cops come
Eighty nigga's came when your fucking block got dumb
[Hook]

[Intro]
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I dont do black music, I dont do white music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
From a slip disk from a Limp Bizkit disk
I just missed the gift list for Christmas gifts
So I get pissed and can't pick which wrist to slit
Little rich kids in cribs dont attempt this shit
So step back while I prep up to pimp this bitch
So I say to the girl I'm like "what up girl
Shut up girl"
Then I showed her a cut up squirrel
She screamed "bloody murder" so loud everybody heard her
She slapped me in the mouth and called me a 
nutty murderer
I moved up to two blondes kissin' on a futon
Yo baby, what are you on?"
I looked at 'em both and I was like 
"Look, check this out toots I'm lookin for Cookie Puss
I need to speak to him immediately
They played my video on MTV last week
"
And just when I was thinking I was all that and then some
Here comes Fred Durst
"Now Shady let me get some"
[Verse 2: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See me and Shady, I think we got it locked down
Shocked by the sound I got you crusin' with your top down
These two blondes I offered them both a drink and this you would think could get the party started
But instead the girls turned their heads
Opened up their mouth, smelled like somebody farted
So it was time for me to move on
Shady said the living room was a dance floor
So turn me loose
I was cuttin' the rug with this chick, bumped into this dude who was a drunk, and a prick
Rambling on about how he was gonna kill me, wow!
I spilled a drink on his shirt
But no he insisted we should go
And before I could drop him Shady had to clock him
The music stopped the party stood in shock
I looked around grabbed the cutest girl and did the smurf
[Hook]
Turn Me Loose
Turn Me Loose
Turn Me Loose
This party's going my way, or no way at all
Why don't you
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Turn me loose
You better tell them to come reshingle the roof
Cause just keep giving me free drinks 'til I puke
Then Fred will ask me to lead sing in his group
I'm sittin at the bar and I'm not being approached, cause Fred's over there stealin all of my hoes
"Yo Fred save me some"
I walked to these siamese twins and asked to have a threesome
I told them two heads are better than one, plus I respect how ya'll roll together as one
Got a slap in the teeth and a kick in the groin
Stood up like (wait where are you goin?)
Well three strikes and I'm out, and I just struck out two times in a row (ow)
I ain't cryin no more fuck it
I'm chillin did a shot of jeager fell asleep on the ceiling
[Verse 4: Fred Durst]
Who knows what galaxy I came from?
One where a bass drum hung from my high chair
Now I'm a nightmare, you stay right there
I got the fever for the flavor of a single
See me and Shady, I think we got it locked down

Get this paper (twerk dat, pop that)
Work that shaker (twerk dat, pop that)
Go ahead baby (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Turn around lady (twerk dat, pop that)
Everything on us now (twerk dat, pop that)
Turn down for what now (twerk-twerk dat, pop that)
Bag it up, turn around now (twerk dat, pop that)
Let me see you drop it down now (twerk-twerk, twerk dat, pop that)
[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
Who said gangstas don't do that? Cause they lying
In the back of the pussy club, it's all mine
Getting drenched by the cheese, spend 'em rain and shine
They head to another one, can't decline
What up to the DJ, straight to the back
Ten racks to the waitress, change for all that
Twenty something years old, ass so fat
Them boys in the club, D hats all black
Tops coming off, ass on the floor
Guess ten ain't enough, so I gotta get more
They'll lose their mind if I head to the door
They don't love me, they love the bread I blow
God damn, got em on they hands and they knees
Scratching after scratch like rats for the cheese
I'm a dog, I even got scratch for the fleas
Touch my money you could touch your knees
[Hook]
[Bridge: Royce Da 5'9"]
I got a white girl (I got a white girl)
She's a dancer 
(It's Tricky!)
She do whatever I say, no matter what I ask her
Her action's the answer (Talk to)
Of course she know I got a 
Who's also a dancer
Don't talk about your life, don't wanna hear about your bottles and ice
Cause we got Marshall out the house tonight
Stay awake
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’m in VIP with no ID with a pint of Beam
Lightin' cheeba, wylin’ the fuck out like Bieber at nineteen
Or Ice-T in the 90s
Frightening in some Nikes slut, nice D’s
There a slight breeze? Don’t like me? Well then bite me
There might be a better chance of flight 370 turning up than us, bitch (highly unlikely)
Little dyke think ‘cause I’m Libra - you're Pisces, and you’re feisty
That you're like me and you might find that we’re like minded
We ain’t nothing alike Diva, you like sleeves
I'm a wife beater you white tease
Bet you like skiing though right skeez?
The way you’re balancing yourself on the poles
Why don’t you grab this one and Do The Right Thing like Spike Lee
And look out like you’re sightseeing and invite me in the back and bite me in the (God damn)
Shake that 
 and titties Cassidy felt that
Dick so fat it could practically snap her chastity belt strap
 all in the back where my 
 at
She actually fell back and landed on somebody else’s lap
And laughed, thought she sat on Pharrell’s hat
(Twerk dat, pop that)
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
Fresh out of damn near everything I had
Lil homie, just grabbed the whole damn bag
I could spend all year, never blow my stacks
Getting white boy wasted, hold my mac
Back to the spot, roll some up
So blown last night I toked some up
Lookers want anything, ain't got enough
In the club without bra's
 ready to get fucked
They drinking, smoking, touching, rubbing
Rolling
, crowd's in love with my thugging
Lick it, taste it, kiss it, suck it
SHIT! Tryna see who want fucking
Drop that thong, grab that pole
Bend it over, let me see what I can do with that (OH!)
Stack so big it ain't never gonna fold
All the 
 I spend, you ain't never gonna close
[Hook]

[Intro]
Slim mother fuckin' Shady...
 alright!
Missy Elliot, Timbo, c'mon, yo !
[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm homicidal, and suicidal, with no friends
Holding a gun with no handles, just a barrel at both ends
Sprayin' tecs at you
Until you see your fuckin legs with the bullets holes and the exit wounds layin' next to you
Fuckin' mad dog, foamin' out the mouth
Fuck mouth, my whole house is foamin' out the couch
Jumped outta a 93rd floor of a buildin'
And shot every window out on the way to the ground (keep filmin')
Woke up to a hospital staff
Got up and laughed
Chopped em in half
And sufficated your oxygen mask
Shit if I get any higher ima get the east and west beefin' again
Fly back to Detroit and stand in the cross-fire
(oh fuck...oh shit
I got the hotel room ready
What time are you gettin off.....work
Or shall I say)
 aight, yo, yo, yo one more time, yo
(what time are you comin' over)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yo, yo, im only smilin' when im violent
Got on the plane wylin
Told the pilot to fly me to Tylenol Island
Stewardess like "you restless?"
"no bitch, im restful so hold this fuckin jet still so I can eat these pretzels"
Forget school
The other kids are disrespectful
They hold me down and play connect-the-dots with my freckles
I can't take it
I'm tryin to gain weight
So I eat steak
And swallow the whole plate
And weigh myself, naked
Put out albums
To teach kids family values
Cuz every mom and dad should allow you to pop valiums
And never hit someone unless you got a reason
And if there ain't a reason
Make one up - start swingin'

[Intro]
A lot of people ask me
Where the fuck I've been at the last few years
Shit, I don't know but I do know I'm back now
[Hook]
Here comes the rain and thunder now
No where to run, to run to now
I disappeared, don't wonder how
Looking for me?
 
I'm underground
[Verse 1]
Dre,
 
I'm down here, under the ground, dig me up
Broken tibias, fibias, 
yeah, fix me up
60 sluts, all of them dying from
 
asphyxia
After they sip piss through a Christopher Reeves sippy cup
Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of Oxy pads
Enough Oxycontin to send a fuckin' ox to rehab
Wack job in the back in a 
black stocking cap
Jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match
(He can't say that!) Yes he can, I just did
, 
faggot
Now guess again
, 
better text message your next-of-kin
Tell 'em shit's about to get extra messy, especially when I flex again
And throw a fuckin' lesbian in
 
wet cement
Faggoty, faggoty, faggoty
, 
Raggedy Ann and Andy
No! Raggedy Andy and Andy
; no, it can't be, it can't be
Yes, it can be, 
the fucking Anti-Christ is back, Dante
It's Satan in black satin panties
This is 
Amityville calamity
, goddamn it
Insanity pills
, 
fanny pack filled with Xannies
Through every nook and cranny lookin' for trannies
Milk and cookies spilled on my silk negligee, looky
Razor-ba-lades with me to make you ba-leed
Cases of Maybelline makeup lay on a table of weed
"Slim Shady? Shit sounds like a fable to me"
'til he jumps out of the fuckin' toilet when you're taking a pee!
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
6 semen samples, 17 strands of hair
Found in the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fair
Hannah Montana, prepare to elope with a can-opener
And be cut open like cantaloupe
 and 
canopy beds
And 
Glad bags,
 
yeah, glad to be back
Cause last year was a tragedy that landed me smack-dab in rehab
Fuckin' doctor, I didn't understand a damn word he said
I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
Two weeks in Brighton
, 
I ain't enlightened
Biting into a fuckin' Vicodin like I'm a Viking
Oh, lightning is striking, it might be a fuckin' sign, I need a psychic
Evaluation
, 
Fuck Jason, it's Friday the 19th!
That means it's just a regular day
And this is the kind of shit I think of regularly
Fucking lesbian shouldn't have had her legs in the way
Now she's pregnant and gay, missin' both legs and begging to stay
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Tell the critics I'm back and comin' to spit it back in abundance
Hit a fag with onions, then split a bag of Funyuns
Mad at me? Understandable
, 
cannibal, shoot an animal
Out of a cannon and have 'em catapult at an adult
Captain of a cult, with an
 
elite following
To turn Halloween back into a trick-or-treat holiday
Have Michael Myers lookin' like a liar, swipe his power
Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
Hit Jason Vorhees
 with a 
40
Stuck a suppository up his ass and made him tell me a story
Gave Hannibal Lector a fuckin' nectarine and sat him
In the fuckin' fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
Walked up Elm street with a fucking whiffle bat drew
Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissorhands, too
Came out with a little scratch, ew
Lookin' like I got in a fuckin' pillow fight with a triple-fat goose
Insanity, can it be vanity? Where is the humanity
In having a twisted fantasy with an arm-and-leg amputee?
Straitjacket with a hundred eight brackets
With a strap that wraps twice around my back then they latch it
Cut your fucking head off and ask you where you're headed off to
Get it? Headed off to?
 
Medic, this headache's awful
This anesthetic's pathetic
, so's this 
diabetic waffle
And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco
[Hook]
[Outro]
- So, it wasn't a choice, it was I had to do this
And now I'm 90 days clean and uh, that's all I have to share
Thanks
- Thanks for sharing Brian, is there anyone else who would like to share this evening?
- Yeah I got something I want to share:
Where's everybody going? This always went over real big in 
gay a
Ok wait, I got another one
 Oh, shit

Chem-le-le-le-le-le-le-le, le-le, le-le
Chem-ne-le-eh-ne-nuf-nu-nef, ne-nish, le-le..

So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Two pills I pop, 'til my pupils swell up like two pennies
I'm Clint Eastwood in his mid-twenties
A young ass man with a trash can, strapped to the back
Of his ass so the rats can't chew through his last pants
I'm like a mummy at night, fightin' with bright lightnin'
Frightened with 
five little white Vicodin pills bitin' him
I'm like a fuckin' wasp in the hospital lost
Stingin' the fuck outta everything I come across in the halls
I light a candle and place it up on the mantle
Grab a knife at the blade and stab you with the fucking handle
So when you find yourself wrapped up in the blinds, hurting
(Bitch it's too late)
Cause once you're hung from the drapes, it's curtains
[Swifty]
I'm an instigator, .380 slug penetrator
Degrading, creating murders to kill haters
Accused for every crime known through the equator
They knew I did it for having blood on my 'gators
My weed'll hit your chest like a double barrel gauge and
I'm a black grenade that'll blow up in your face
With a fifth in me, when I guzzle Remi I do shit on purpose
You never hear me say forgive me
I'm snatchin every penny, it gotta be that way nigga, face it
That weed I sold to you, Brigade laced it
You hidin, I make the president get a facelift
Niggas just afraid, handin' me they bracelets
Chilling in the lab wasted
I'm the type that'll drink Kahlua and gin, throw up on the mic
Your life is ruined, 
you get socked right on site
And even at the Million Man March, we gon' fight
[Hook: Eminem]
So you can suck my dick if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
Cause I don't give a fuck if you don't like, my shit
Cause I was high when I wrote this so suck, my dick
[Bizarre]
I'm a compulsive liar,
 
setting my preacher on fire
Slashing your tires,
 flying down 
Fenkell and Meyers
Plates expired,
 
soon as I'm hired, I'm fired
Jacking my dick off in a bed of barbed wire
(Hey, is Bizarre performing)
Bitch didn't you read the flyer
Special invited guest will be, Richard Pryor
(Aren't you a male dancer)
Nah bitch, I'm retired
Fucking your bitch in the ass with a tire iron
I'm ripped, I'm on an acid trip
My DJ's in a coma for letting the record skip
I'm fucking anything when I'm snorting
It's gonna cost 300 dollars to get my pitbull an abortion
Some bitch asked for my autograph
I called her a whore, spit beer in her face and laughed
I drop bombs like I was in Vietnam
All bitches is hoes, even my stinkin' ass mom
[Proof]
Ayo, flashback, two feets, two deep up in that ass crack
Weed laced with something,
 
nigga pass that
In Amsterdam we only hang out with hash rats
At a Stop the Violence rally, I blast gats
BMI on publishing, get your ASCAP-ped
The Kuniva, divide up your cash stack
Run your motherfuckin' pockets, ASAP
I don't need a platinum chain bitch, I snatch Shaq's
Born loser, half thief and half black
Bring your boys and your guns and get laughed at
Bitch smacker, rich rappers
 
get they Jag jacked
And found chopped up in a trash bag
[Kuniva]
We strangling rappers until the point they can't yell
Cause they crew is full of fags and sweeter than bake sales
Reckless, come from behind and snatch your necklace
Gruesome, and causin more violence than nine hoodlums
I grapple your adam's apple until it crackle
Run right past you, turn around, grab you and stab you
Get executed, cause I'm a Luni, I got a Yukmouth
And it's polluted,
 
I cock it back then shoot it
I love snatching up players thugs and young ballers
Shoot up the household, even the young toddlers
Brigade
 
barricade to bring the noise
While the bullets break your bones up like Christmas toys
If I go solo, I'm doin a song with Bolo
A big Chinese nigga, screamin Kuniva, yo, yo...
I leave ya face leaking, run up in church
And smack the preacher while he's preaching, take a swing at the deacon
[Kon Artis]
I used to tell cats I sold weed and weight
I was straight 'til I got caught selling em shape
I'm ignorant, with the intent to snatch your rent
I got kicked out of summer camp for having sex in my tent
With the superintendent's daughter, my brain's out of order
I've been a Kon Artis
 
since I was swimmin in water
In cahoots with this nigga named Carlisle Von
Who got fired from UPS for tryin to send you a bomb
(Special delivery)
I signed to a local label for fun
Say I got cancer, get dropped, take the advancement and run
Drive-by you in the rain while you carry your son
Call your house and hang up on you for not giving me none
Born straight up out a pussy but a son of a gun
Got a reputation for havin niggas running they funds
Used to be the type of nigga that was folding some ones
'til I met your fat mama, now I'm rolling in dough
[Hook]
[Outro]
Ha ha.. suck my mothafuckin' dick
D-12.. Dirty-mothafuckin'-Dozen
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with thirty fuckin husbands
Bizarre Kid,
 
Swifty McVay,
 
the Kon Artis
The Kuniva,
 
Dirty Harry
 
and Slim Shady

[Intro]
Nah man, not quite finished yet!
[Verse 1]
Girl, I think you just might have tried
To pull a motherfuckin’ fast one. I’m mad
You just hurt my goddamn feeling
And that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, trying to play games?
See this saw blade?
 
See this silhouette
Of a stalker in your walkway?
 Better cooperate
Or get sauteed and rotisseried
 
while you’re hog-tied
MC’s get so quiet you can hear
A motherfucking dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule stunting on that ass
Like a fuckin’ Fall Guy!
 
I don’t gas my Mercedes
After midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
Cause it will turn into a Gremlin and run over kids
Women and men - 
"Vrinn Vrinn!"
 - 
motor so big
You can fit a midget in his engine
Bitch, gimme them digits; while you cringin’
?
Not by the hair on my chinny-chin-chin will I spend spend
Even 10 cents on you.
 Since when
Did you think it’ll cost me a pretty penny
Shit, if I think a penny’s pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, catch an eskimo by his toe
While he’s trying to roll a snowball
But, don’t make him lose his cool
If he hollers better let him go y’all
[Hook]
You don't own me
Now 
here we go
, go, go!
[Verse 2]
Get up baby, get a move on like a U-Haul
You can rack your brain like pool balls
You won't ever think of this shit
"Yeah, honey, you called?"
 Well here I come
Havoc on a beat, I wreak it
Evil: I see, hear and speak it
Lady put your money on Shady, fuck that other weak shit
Put your eggs in the same basket
You can count every motherfuckin’ chicken fore it hatches
Cause you can bet your ass 
we gonna get it crackin’
Like Kraken and Titans when they're clashin'
Get your brains bashed in
 
so bad
You’re gonna have Kurt Cobain askin’
To autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable and
 
about as rational
As a rash on a fag’s asshole
Now let’s take that line run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he’s cool with it
Don’t stand there and look stupid at me
Bitch I ain’t in the mood for this shit
Get my dick, Google it, til it pops up
Y’all just so motherfuckin’ full of shit
That you stopped up
Me I’m always shitting diarrhea of the mouth
Till your speakers crap out, "pfft, huh what?"
Girl you got a hot butt, like a lit cigarette
(chig-chigga-ret) 
But you won’t get a hot fudge sundae
From me
 
so don’t strut my way, slut because…
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
And now that I got your panties in a bunch
And your bowels in an uproar
I'mma show you why I came
So you stop asking me what the fuck for
Now look, you little slut, cunt whore
I know you want more
Bitch, it’s time to put the math back into Mathers
Cause I’m a fuckin’ problem
, run boy
Every flow, got it mastered, so
Every last word that you fuckin’ fags heard
Comes straight from the fish's ass
Yeah, in other words I’m a "bass-turd"
Looking at me like I killed Kenny
Gas in the tank? Yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me so remorse
I really don’t feel any
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable
Why you’re jealous, fucking animal?
I got cannibal magnetism
Can't resist em, now can you, ho?
“Shady I don’t understand your flow”, understand my flow?
Bitch, I flow like Troy Polamalu’s hair boy
Don’t you dare try to follow or compare boy
I’m raw, you ain’t even medium-rare
Stay the fuck outta my hair, boy
You can look, you can stare and point
But you can’t touch, I’m too clairvoyant
I don’t get it man, is there a void?
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well bitch I’m back, 
with some shit for that ass
And your trunk: elephant, hemorrhoids
And remember boys…
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
Until next time, peace

[Intro]
Since '99 nigga!
February 23rd man
February 23rd '99 dog
Never forget it
January 23rd I saw the video
Thank you!
[Verse 1]
Soon as I got the offer I knew we would be the best of friends
The day we met was when I never second guessed again
But I had to breathe a breath again, I can't call you next to kin
So I signed the deal I can feel the pressure
Cause the rest that are in the industry were wishing for your death again
Tried to warn you 'bout the things I saw when we got in the car
But we just had the talk of the millennium, never tell secrets to anyone
You got mad dough, I ain't have any ones'
So for a weekend, maybe even a day
Stay in sleep in the place I would pray just to see your face
Be a Harlem nigga, I'll be that superstar
I see the future dog, let's see if you can walk
[Hook]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain
You feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (So...)
[Verse 2]
I don't mean to bring family in this song
Don't get it wrong but in the morning I can hear a different song
I know you feeling down, I see the ceiling now
Cause I been getting down since I found rock bottom
Hot topic was my hangout
Stardom was always the wish by carry this wish list from Harlem
Or Cleveland, we both from the Midwest
It's insane how we both suffered
In and unless, you'll be a chump
Let's play the block watch some Harlem chicks get undressed
Call them slides my nigga
Either way we gonna ride my nigga (Huh)
You already know man
I might be the biggest fan
You might be the biggest fan
Still wasn't into playing stick at that label so...
[Hook]
In my shoes, just to see what it's like to be me
I'll be you, let's trade shoes
Just to see what it'd be like to feel your pain
You feel mine, go inside each other's minds
Just to see what we find
Look at shit through each other's eyes
But don't let em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (So...)
Don't let em say you ain't beautiful
They can all get fucked, just stay true to you (So...)
[Outro]
Nigga I ain't cry when I got dropped man
You know why I ain't cry?
Nigga you was quoting my bars
Whatchu mean so nigga?
You was quoting my bars to my face my nigga
Forgot it? Forgot I played bass line?
You forgot about "I don't care"?
My nigga yo, I swear after that day I ain't ever...
Man, listen
Anything is possible man
I dead-ass remember, I remember
Thank you!
By the way check? Nigga you nice, haha

[Verse 1: Dandyguel]
[Verse 2: Tuan X]
I said, put me on a track wit' Nas & them, fuck it
Put me on a track wit' Jay & Em.
 
My name is Tuan
Say it like the numbers bitches 2-1
Bred in The Stuy, Brooklyn 'til I dizzie
Ain't for the punch-line rhymes, I ain't got the tizzime
I hit you wit' that real shit, kop it for a dizzime
I hit you wit' that hood shit, umbrella in the rain flow
Where if you go to prison pretty, come out wearin' a rainbow
Now how that saying go? "Ain't No Love"
We in the heart of the matter lookin' for gram green
Searching for God in a blunt, diggin' for love in a cunt
And all we get is this ditch & a triflin' bitch
My 1st love was a whore, knew I was God when I saw
My boy die, my mom cry, failing to die 3 times
Three lives, now I'm livin' on my last
My future's goin' right & what's left is in the past
See, I told my grandma I'm stayin' off that crime shit
I told my cousin, "When you write make sure it's life shit."
My life's a feature film
, 
music's my cinema
,
You are the audience, now here's a preview
There will be no sequel no prequel
It's a one time affair
, 
weave in ya best hair
Put on ya best Airs
 and 
wear ya best ears
Now listen, listen here. Mr. X shall be here
Forever long, however long forever long can be
Spit heaven on and hell upon these heroinic beats
Now get up on him, feel up on her, feel a boner.. beat
Now marijuana, legalize it, I don't smoke, I preach
Life's a beach & I'm the best swimmer
And talking to my women, you are the best dinner
And I am so sinner, but I don't believe in hell
If life is fresh water, my mind is the well

[Thug] There he go right there, got this nigga. What's up Obie?
*gun fire*
[Obie] Oh shit
*gun fire*
[Thug] Uh, uh, uh nigga. Yeah nigga, shit
*car pulls away*
Obie Trice
[Hook]
You can catch me in the hood, up to no good
With that Mac like right beside me
I ain't by no niggas eyeing my figures
Deprive me of my life, try me
I'mma rip up tissue, homie I won't miss you
This'll be the day that ya dying
Nigga I'm violent
Ya hearing the sirens, once that ass silence
For fucking with me, nigga I'm violent
Cause I'm so tired of these wannabe riders trying to touch Obie
Cause nigga I'm violent
[1st verse]
Hat match the jacket, jack match the glove
Glove match the Mac that send niggas above
All black when his faggot ass acts up
When the boys interrupted haters can't wait to duck
Cause when I buck I leave a peep hole in his face
They peep O in the place then they get a bad taste
In they mouth, running his lip, I pull that ouch off my hip
Commence to spit, I'm too grown for this
But they tend to take you back to when you're known for riff raff
That'll be his ass, fucking with this cat
[Hook]
[2nd verse]
They say O calm ya nerve, but some niggas need to be served
Cause it's purpose is unheard of
Blacks done seen too much murder to flirt with death
Guess he feels it ain't nuthin left
That's when the weapon is taking it's last breath
If he think for a second he taking me outta my flesh
Violent when it comes to putting Obie to rest
Natural cause is the only way they say he left
Not from no hater, I got too many guns
So, when it come to that shit, I'm off one nigga
[Hook]
[3rd verse]
Incapacitating O, no, I'm so
Observational I recognize you ho's
Nocturnal mufuckas knocking ya mans
Cause I'm sitting on paper bigger then Shaq hands
Plus every chance I get Obie advance
From spitting to getting riches, I'm so enhanced
On bitch ass niggas trying to slow my plans
Realest shit a nigga ever spoke to fans
Listen, I'm taking kites in the pen
A nigga ever offend again, and that's on my kid
[Hook]

Rack Bitches, Itching 4a Fixin', Lickin' Vixens, Smitten
Ripe & Rippin
Ripped & Rifting
Sippin' Pit
CHA
's
Siftin' Pict
CHA
's
Fictitious Nigga's

[Verse: Obie Trice]
They say he was a monster from birth, so
Fuck it, I'll just a lean warn-os them hoes
I suppose O took on the street life
Even though my mother told me I could be otherwise
Wasn't the school type, I was too cool
My agenda wasn't general education, nigga
Generalizing Obie's expectations
It was like, a cucoo in twenty-twos
Bad news my nigga, pass the brew
Cause in a week we be pouring a glass for you
So rapidly homies become causualties
We was just playing Madden
Now a nigga sad for his family, that's how it happens
Dudes get blasted, another casket
Another child becomes a fatherless bastard
Make a nigga wanna grab this rachet
It's so tragic, and Obie can't get past it
And you wonder why a nigga'll flash it
Just to show these demons that I ain't having it
Put 'em beneath the grass in a flash
Homie I'm from the craft
And to make it where I'm at, that's called Soldierism
Real niggas notice em, they wanna flow with 'em
Wanna do major shows with 'em
Get the fuck out the ghetto with 'em
Heavy metal, leave a nigga twisted, don't fret
This is the set we live in
But I ain't crying or whining about my environment
Even though black folk is dying constant
Niggas'll shoot you unconscious
With no conscience, until you lose conscience
Conscious, 
and pompous white folk think I'm just rhyming
Just designing lines, just for the sake of shining
Like I just speak violent applying to the business I'm in
Rewind and find him in a dirty ass hood with no sight of climbing
Moving on up was just The Jeffersons
Rest of us watching the tube got less then them
So why you vexing him? Why you stretching him out?
He got the weapon all because his whereabouts
Born and raised, mental slaves
And I don't see change before I'm seeing the grave
All I see is my homies corpse decay
Crying at his wake, can't recognize his face
Face it, you not identifying with me
My identity distorts ya visibility
So you can't see me, peep what he's achieving
You recieve information from TV
I'm in the hood, I live it you read about it
Rest in peace Peezy
Please believe Obie eyes've seen The Wire
Prior to what you seeing on the screen
I done been in and out of the bing
Lost niggas to unfortunate things
That's why, praise the Lord I'm still on the scene
Praise the Creator who made human beings
Just for creating a nigga like me
A nigga that put the umph in G, yeah
[Hook: Eminem & Obie Trice] (2X)
(Wake up)
I try to reach out but you won't
(Wake up)
My brothers and sisters, we got to
(Wake up)
'Fore you stuck in the system, and then you
(Wake up)
Reality hits you, before you can
(Wake up)

[Intro: T.I.]
Yeah, yeah, no roof
Live life topless, can't nobody stop this
[Verse 1: T.I.]
Ay, this the DR., in charge saving out artists out the ER
Bring them back to life, beats like CPR
Made the westside worldwide, no PR
Gangsta rap god, I'm the end all, be all
California love,
 
from the Bloods to the C-Dogs
The Compton monsters make you wanna cut your MP off
The greatest in the game, haters should be ashamed
For not acknowledging the brain of the west coast king
Brought Chronic to the scene,
 folded pills in the lean
Now the game full of puppets
, 
look at me: no strings
Again and again I've shown, you seen me
Piss on niggas' egos, ruin they self esteem
Sky the limit, no roof, I can do what you dream
Done it all 'fore you ever did a thing, knamean?
Tees and black jeans, no bling, just bang
Officially deranged, clinically insane
Look Eazy, ain't a damn thing changed, I promise
Still live like we did back with "Straight Outta Compton"
Taught niggas how to have attitudes on some hood shit
Showed them what to smoke when they were blazing that bullshit
That's why you smell the drug aroma when my record play
Not a blemish on my image, decorated resume
A legendary legacy
All that I was, you'll never be, fuck is y'all telling me?
Forever on top
Face it, you'll never be better than the Doc, ask Pac
Again, I say it's never gon' stop
Face it, you'll never be greater than the Doc, ask Pac
[Hook: Dr. Dre]
Guns blaze when I shine
Make a wish quick, no star and I'm the shooting kind
Front page all the time
You boys think sick, but I ain't got no roof on mine
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Like my girl is the game with her titties out
(I dream topless, I live topless)
Sky is the limit, I'm paid to run the city now
[Verse 2: Eminem]
My motto is live by the bottle, so why is my supply low?
Bring in a truckload with a high-low
Stay grounded, but I still reach for the sky, though
Ghetto idol, I think, but what do I know?
Shit, I know a lot more than I should
The hood stood by me just like I thought it would
Don't act like I'm Hollywood when I probably could
I don't polly
, 
Muhammad Ali of rap
, I don't lolly gag
West coast, the home of the body bag
The shotty, the mag, Los Angeles, where the party at?
You can catch me anywhere where there's Bacardi at
Yeah, Andre is back, so have a cardiac
Started back with the black
, Raiders starter cap
Gangsta rap, we practically fucking started that
Everyday with this game I'm getting smarter at
Sky's the limit so every time I get on the track
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Your skin's your travelling bag of your existence
Yours is shabby and scab, while mine's glistenin'
Vivid on my skin, how many continents I visit then
You can journey with me to different places by listenin'
Shitting on them, your brother got it covered
We can slug it, knuckle it, however you want it, I love it
A hustler's wit, the grit, the grind
My genetic code make up, murderer by design
On Mayan calendar time, when night meets day
I'm in the light grey Bugatti like a high speed chase
Adrenaline like jogger, the jumping rope in place
Muhammed Ali hobbies, no Pilates, try'na keep the ocean by me
Hit a rich man's wife, see what these hoes can buy me
Looking forward, but it's nice to see the road behind me
Hotel's a seven star, Baguette's glowing
Keep your lid, yet dawg, the private jet Boeing, topless
[Hook]

[Hook]
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you gotta go that way
You gotta go, you-you gotta go, you-you gotta go, you, but-but I wanna
See you do the, see you do the, see you do the walk of
See you do the, see you do the,
 
see you do the walk of (Shame)
[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
Six in the morning, don't even know your name
Even though I'm glad that you came,
 
I'm sorry, but (you gotta go)
Instead of tryna parler, why don't you make
Like heaven's having a soiree?
 
The party's up
 (You gotta go)
No disrespect to you, I just met you, you special but would you
 
(gotta go)
And even though I feel you fly, my incidental bill’s too high, sorry
Here, put my number in your phone so we can talk again
That walk to the lobby you got, we call that the walk of shame
I don’t know what room Joey’s in, or where’s your friend
I don’t know your friend
, no offense but (you gotta go)
[Interlude]
Goodbye, muah
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Crooked I]
It all started when she stuck out her rear
Top bunk of the tour bus, she getting dug out up here
It felt like we could have hung out a year
But I was thinking with my dick, now bitch get the fuck out of here
I’m sorry that I did your girl reckless
I fed her a squirrel breakfast, she left with a pearl necklace
That big old ass had to be felt on
Or else it’s just a waste like the space, I put my belt on
Now tell me what the hell is wrong
Fed with your ex, you get sex and get mailed home
Thugnificant tells em go that way
Then I send that bitch a smiley face (Bitches love a smiley face)
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Joe Budden]
Cab on speed dial,
 I ain’t with devotion
Ain’t buying what you’re selling, nah, I ain’t drinking the potion
Plan like anything slow motion
But a sweet baby Jesus when the frank’s in the ocean
I don’t know magic tricks, but you’ll see plenty soon
Amazing how good one night stand in this empty room
She got gall, being the noise she had at breakfast
I tell her role play and be a voyeur with the exit
No, you don’t get a key to the crib
You can be my wife for a hour get me in your rib but then you (gotta go)
And this party ain’t unusual
She's sorry she came, I’m sorry it’s not mutual
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Joell Ortiz]
Yeah, last night was fun, but that look like the sun
So yeah, last night is done and um (you gotta go)
I know, I’m sad too,
 
don’t forget your earrings
Oh, these ain't yours?
 
My bad, but here’s your bag, boo
 (You gotta go)
Your hair looks fine; I swear, your hair looks fine
Plus nobody care, you a dime
 
but look at the time, girl
 (You gotta go)
I got shit to do but next time I’m in town you got my word
I’mma get with you,
 
now where the fuck is this missing shoe? (You gotta go)
When I go in tour I find me a ho for sure
With open jaws and cute knees that both go on floors
Gina's and Pam's,
 
I ain’t tryna be Cole
But in the words of Martin: you ain't gotta go home
 
but
[Hook]

[Intro]
Woooo! 
It's Shady
 aka 
the Army Shady Records
Break it down
I do a lotta spittin' and I don't gotta try
But I ain't got rhymes to waste so let's make it
I don't say I'm a gangsta, I ain't gotta start fronting
I just call 
Banks
 up when I need to 
pop something
[Verse 1]
I got a friend of mine,
 
named 50 Cent I signed
This shit's official now,
 
the deals is finished and it's time
To get down to this business, let's get these nicks and dimes
So hurry up and cop, G-Unit shit before it's gone
Its like a gold mine for my man to take nine
And bounce right back,
 he gotta be like 
Michael Myers
This shit must be a sign, these labels must be blind
Columbia,
 
I know this must be fucking with they mind
They know they 'bout to cry cause they missed out
But 
I know how to get the dough cause Dre gave me a business mind
I said in my line, I hit 'em with a nine
I had a empty clip but they ain't check the chamber
[Hook]
I ain't no gangsta, I ain't gotta start fronting
I just call Banks up when I need to pop something
But you gon' feel my shit, you gonna hit the stop button
We fuck you up a long time, you gon' get 
stomped stunting
[Verse 2]
Damn 50, this shit's about to hit the fan 50
Fuck happened to Ja?
He got the sickest vendetta, he must think that you betta
He bought to play with his paper, you gonna fuck with this chedda
Now homie think we gon' sweat 'em but we just gon' forget 'em
If he don't shut up we'll dead'em, let Yayo stomp his head in
It's all good cause we'd rather rap then to let a
Pussy play us outta pocket homie, so tell 'em
He better be easy
Start some bullshit, he'll get his whole crew wet
D-Twizzy, Obie, 50 Cent and G-Unit
Yo, he don't want it cause he's always drugged out
You won't see one picture where his pupils ain't bugged out
[Hook]

[Intro: Eminem]
Woo!!! Yeah!!! Remix!!! (50 Cent: Ha Ha!!!)
Lloyd Banks!!! (Lloyd Banks: Uh Huh!!!) Ha Ha!!!
[Verse 1: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he don't even own
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He don't want the room or want the loot he's in it for the sport
Running circles 'round his competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't begging for it
And you can love and you can hate it
But you can't ignore it, you can't be that ig-nor-ant
But you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys
And If I'm fronting man you better come confront me for it
[Hook: Nate Dogg]
This is the story of a warrior, I know you know it
True warriors go ahead and make some noise
It ain't healthy to be making niggas paranoid
Hit your corner with my weapon I don't need my boys
I'm doing a hundred tween in the fast lane
Kick back just relax let me do my thing
Don't give a fuck about you suckers gotta maintain
Money, power and respect in this rap game
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
He's straight outta a neighborhood where niggas hate
To see you blow and eat your dinner off a bigger plate
Their stomachs ache while he's lounging in the big estate
And he hops in a hundred thousand where the nigga stay, houses with a bigger gate
Hounding him's a big mistake, 
he won't surrender he'll rather give up a rib to break
Cause he remembers when they wouldn't lend a helping hand
Till he was sitting on green like a Celtic fan
Created a buzz to where you gotta mention his name
When you discussing the illest players that's in the game
And he's riding with Em, 50 Cent, Doc and 'em
G-Unit Records ain't a motherfucker stopping them
[Hook]
[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
He's no magician man the kid does something out of nothing
So that niggas from his hood act like he owes him something
They talk crazy till they send niggas to where to buck him
Ask him if it's a problem and he'll say "nah, it's nothing"
He was gonna help 'em out but since they fronted fuck 'em
He don't care how they feel they can hate him or love him
He held his own on his own the kid is really thugging
He's rich now, he ain't changed so niggas think he bugging
He bulletproof everything cause niggas try and buck him
Keeps two pistols on his hip I'll show you where he tuck 'em
Niggas say they gon' get at him but they can't touch him
Try to catch him slipping they creep in and he start bussing
[Hook]
[Outro: Nate Dogg]
I can give you niggas something you can talk about
I can turn your smile upside down
You ain't no G you a fucking clown
I can take your girl and tu-turn her out
Don't hold it in let it all out
I can give you fuckers something to be mad about
Invite her in send her back out
With my DNA all in her mouth

She spends her time getting
Wasted away, wasted away
Take a couple more shots to the face
A couple more drinks she won't mind how that taste
She smiles but inside she want to cry
I can see it in here face
She's wasted away, come on now don't get wasted away
Come girl don't get wasted away
Come now you can do it you can make it out
Girl if you don't waste it away
Spoiled rotten and she was only eighteen
When she graduated high school
Pursuing her dreams
She wanted money, cars, clothes
You know the finer of things
She had a boyfriend just to show
She was no one night fling
And she was happy and content
On the outside it seemed
But inside she felt hurt
Pain was angry and mean
No self-esteem even though
She was the homecoming queen
Without about a pound of make up
She refused to be seen
You see she loved her mom and dad
But now they didn't love each other
She knows her mom is cheatin'
But she keeps it undercover
Cause they argue so much
She wonders if they even love her
And on top of that
She's stressed about college
After the summer
No the stress is building up
And she can't handle the weight
She started hanging out with low life's
Cause they could relate
She started getting drunk and high
Because that made her feel great
No one would've guessed the turn
That her summer would take
She's...
Wasted away, wasted away
Take a couple more shots to the face
A couple more drinks she won't mind how that taste
She smiles but inside she want to cry
I can see it in here face
She's wasted away, come on now don't get wasted away
Come girl don't get wasted away
Come now you can do it you can make it out
Girl if you don't waste it away
She's getting caught up in her devilish ways
Her boyfriends trying to call her
Hasn't seen her in days
And he's just hoping that she loves him
And her feelings don't change
He was always there to take care of her
When she was in pain
When she would cry about her parents
He would wipe away tears
When she was stressed about college
He would take away fears
He's love for her was still growing
After four long years
And though he never had much
He'd give her everything here
Then one night she took it on herself
To alter their fate
Her new friends yelling at her
Take this shot to the face
She found herself at a party drunk
Nothing to chase
Went with a dude up to his room
He got his hands on her waist
Things started to escalate
Panties moved to the side
She said go head and hit raw
So he slipped it inside
She gave it up for this guy
Then when morning arrived
Texted her boyfriend
It was over cold and empty inside
She's...
Wasted away, wasted away
Take a couple more shots to the face
A couple more drinks she won't mind how that taste
She smiles but inside she want to cry
I can see it in here face
She's wasted away, come on now don't get wasted away
Come girl don't get wasted away
Come now you can do it you can make it out
Girl if you don't waste it away
She never told him she cheated
Or even gave him a reason
And now his heart is broken
Emptied, depleted
She's at the club acting out
All because of the split
And I was there too
The night she drunk, jumped in her wipe
Trying not to get sick
Cruising down route 86
The headlights were too bright
She turned the steering wheel quick
And in that moment her whole world
Slowed down to a tic
That's when she drove into
The driver of an all blue Buick
And what she saw next
Left her empty and cold
Her boyfriend of four years
Left dead on the road
She starring at the sky screaming
God how did this happen
No one responded
But the devil at her shoulder was laughing
Police later found some flowers
And a note on the seat
The note was about how he loved her
And how he wished they could be
And when she heard it was for her
She broke down in defeat
Forever tortured by the same words
Stuck on repeat
She's...
Wasted away, wasted away
Take a couple more shots to the face
A couple more drinks she won't mind how that taste
She smiles but inside she want to cry
I can see it in here face
She's wasted away, come on now don't get wasted away
Come girl don't get wasted away
Come now you can do it you can make it out
Girl if you don't waste it away

[
Verse 1: Thirstin Howl]
I hit harder than Foreman, landing both gloves to a low blow, with no cup
Leave you speech-less like when Arrested Development broke up
Carry a crow bar for egos that won't budge
Crack skulls through helmets with the penetration of a screw nailed in
Return like I was sending self addressed postage
Throw bricks the size of the Stonehenge
Before battles we pour blood and toast, death to wicked infants
Found on the sorceress' doorsteps, slaughter lamb and boar's head
Every MC's cause of boredness and mind bondage
Bronchitis, lung failure, language unfamiliar
Art through a flooded air brush, broad leave craft
Sentences joined with words holding hands, it's a tight squeeze
From where your head will be landing In exact time flight leaves
[Hook]
Watch this, watch this, watch this
Watch this, don't watch that, watch this
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Who's arm is this? I must have cut it off of the pharmacist
Who refused to renew my seventh prescription of
 
Darvocet
 (Sorry)
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets
And never leaves his house cause he thinks his car's possessed
I hate my life that's why I degrade my wife
Grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich and just ate the knives
My mother's screaming "Please, heal him, take him straight to Christ!"
Meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice
Made a bomb threat with a fake device
Strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice
And if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit you be spitting
I was probably just trying to shake the lice
Bugs falling out of my head
, I'm wishing I was dead
While I'm crawling out of my bed, 
piss
 and vomit red
And my rash is returning 
I feel the sensation of burning
Occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine
Screaming at my shadow "Please, quit following me!"
These pills keep screaming "Please, quit swallowing me!"
The devil keeps screaming "Please, get down on one knee!"
Took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me
[Hook]

[Intro]
Ladies and gentleman
You are now about to witness the strength
Of Aftermath
 
straight out the mothafuckin streets of Compton
Put your hands together for Game bitch
Hahahaha
Yeah mothafuckas
Compton's back on the mothafuckin map
Aftermath in that ass bitch
Game let's go
[Verse 1 - The Game]
Me and Marshall ain't start shit they listen to our shit
They talk shit about us but that shit is foul when
I'm tryna feed my son and drop multi-platinum albums
Make my mother proud that her son made it out
But its hard when they hate us and think 'Em a racist
They say shit but fuck them
Shady one of the greatest like Biggie n' Pac was
We saw the throne was empty and decided to chase it
Me, him and 50 racin' this rap shit is basic I followed that Jay shit
Thinkin what I wanna say,
 
step in the booth in one take
 and
How could I not sell a million when I'm rappin' on Dre hits
Then spit that classical LA, NWA shit
The media is bullshit now
 
we can't even say bitch
They accusin Michael of touchin kids in the wrong places
At first they embraced him
, 
had a couple of face lifts
Now people wanna place him with murderers and rapists
They comin' I can taste this
 swear to God I ain't racin'
Put the clip in and wast 'em before I go out on that fake shit
I'm so sick and tired this black shit this white shit
So I sit here and write shit,
 
Em they ain't gon' like this
[Hook:]
[The Game]
So they callin us
We ain't goin 
no
 where so fuck you
We ain't goin no where so fuck you
[Eminem]
This day the game won't ever be the same
[Dre]
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
[Eminem]
The game just isn't the same its changing
To new Game
You're now about to witness the power
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm making
If I'm faking, I'm Clay Aiken
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame, you're tame
Bitch you're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit
Different day, just with different gangstas in your face
Which- way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Mase and save it
For the day that they got them affidavits waving in my face
Looking for answers, rap sensation Eminem battles to ward off accusations
That he had somebody blasted
The Mask of Jason was found at the scene of the task with masking tape
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wasting too much time
Me no kiss ass,
 and if that's the case, then we ain't going
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - The Game]
Low get Dre on the phone quick
Tell him Em' just killed me on my own shit
I'm walking through 8 mile, startin' to get home sick
I'mma do Shady numbers
, 
I'm ridin' my own dick
Yeah the chrome sick, the window's tinted
If Eminem is anybody armor under the Pendleton
These niggas is killing it take a minute to listen
Turn down my Jimi Hendrix
, 
I'll throw your demo out the window
For tellin me its hot when its not and you got what you got
From them rocks on the block, you can stop tellin Dre you got shot
With a Glock that don't phase me
I'm crazy why the fuck you think I'm rhyming with Shady ?
I don't care if the radio don't play me
I say what I say when I feel like I'm feelin today
And get hard when these bitches see my car in the streets
I can't even take my son to cop them G-Unit sneaks
So I'm gone bitch
[Hook]

[Intro: Tony Yayo]
Yeah!
You rocking with the Talk of New York Tony Yayo
Shady Aftermath
 and 
Soul Assassins
Here we go!
[Hook: Lloyd Banks]
Niggas know what I'm about out here
I don't toot my own horn cause I don't have to
You could run your mouth I don't care
But if you get too close I'm gon' clap you
It's too real out here to be scared
A real nigga gonna do whatever he has to
A man is a last thing you should fear
It ain't considered a crime unless they catch you
We all die one day
[Verse 1: Obie Trice]
Niggas when I step up in a bar (uh huh), faggots wanna look (what?)
Like you motherfuckers got Obie Trice shook
Like I'mma stand here as a man and
Let some queer ass, funny looking nigga get the upper hand (ha ha ha!)
I got issues, got no time, 
got guns that mourn nigga's moms
 (yeah!)
Shoot up clubs and 
destroy nigga's vibes
 (come on!)
Everybody running for their motherfucking lives (AHHHHHH!!!)
Tough club niggas, we leave early, cock back surely
Open up your fade your gray brain meets Motor City pave'
Your nervous system still twitch off Jay-Z
O's an animals skirts get murked
Don't ever let a nigga tell you slugs don't hurt
Don't ever let a nigga tell you to play the bar hard
Trust in God cause you's about to get catch a bullet scar
I give a fuck where you from, who you be with
Keep this a secret {*whispers*} right by the nuts
A 4-5 that'll light niggas up and this 4-5 high make not give a fuck
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
But as long as I'm here I'm gonna grab checks
And make my cash stretch longer than giraffe necks
Poverty'll make your ass bet
My words touch niggas in jail make them wanna finish they last set
They say you live by the gun, you die by the next nigga gun
If that's the case then get a bigger one
You don't think I pack the pump cause I'm out the hood
That's a stereotype like everybody that's black can jump
I'm in the white mink, the fabric is done
Got rings like Mike, Bird, Magic, and them
Out of Dallas to the palace where the Mavericks is from
Living lavish I'm established, so the 
cabbage
'll come
I'm in the clouds
, you don't see me on the train
I travel first class, you ain't even got a TV on your plane
You should be easy on my name cause I ain't going back and forth
Your boss and your captain soft (BITCH!)
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Cause we gon' bring it to anybody who want it, you want it, you gon' get it
Name 'em we gon' hit 'em chew 'em up and spit 'em out
{*Hoch spit*} Too much venom
 
and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
I got too much momentum moving in my direction to lose
My shoes will explode as soon as you go to step in them
, (BOOM)
You know how we do it when we do how we do it when we come through
G-Unit, D-1-2 and Obie
 we all move like assassins
Ski mask and gloves consider this as a warning
Disaster comes faster than you can react to it, just ask 
Muggs
But we are fizast
, fuck your little bitch ass up
We are not killers, my vato will have you shot, though
Dragged through the 
barrio
 and fucked like 
Kim Osorio
's
Little sorry ho ass, go ask 
B-Real
We burn Source covers like fucking Cypress Hill
Did in the 90's
, when you was in diapers still
Shady Records you better believe the hype is real
This is no joke, I don't smoke
But I toke enough secondhand to make my fucking P.O. choke
I'm an OG, you're fucking with a 
G.I. Joe
Bia Bia, mia mio a vida loc'
I'm a psycho, Mariah ain't got shit on me
When I retire I'll be spitting baby food on people
A tent siged on her ranch huddle up next to her
With Hello Kitty slippers on, humping her legs
You ever had your cap peeled back or your shit pushed in?
I put my blade in you like a fucking pin cushion
Slice your ear clear off, Smirnoff and Hen, dog
I'll show you to kill a fucking man like Sen Dog
 (Bring it, bring it, bring it back!)
Nobody told you that I'm loco, ése?
I lack every sane chemical in my membrane
I'm Slim Shay...D and the 'D' is for deez nuts
And you can get each one for free so feast up
I'll pee in a cup for three months
I'm having an E party for Easter please come
Cause we gon'
[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
We gon' bring it to anybody who want it, you want it, you gon' get it
You name 'em and we'll hit 'em, chew 'em up and spit 'em out {*spits*}
Too much venom and if you roll with 'em
We gon' fuck you up with 'em
You can do all them push ups to pump up your chest
I got a twelve gauge Mausberg to pump up your chest
Have you gasping for air after that shell hit your vest
Fear me like you fear God cause I bring death
Silverback gorilla in the concrete jungle
I'm the strongest around, you know how I get down
I watch gangsta flicks and root for the bad guy
And turn it off before it end cause the bad guy die
If you trying to buy guns, I'm the nigga to look to
So what they got bodies on them? They still look new
You can raise your voice like you fitting to touch something
When I raise my knife, shit, I'm fitting to cut something
They say I walk like Ron O'Neal, and talk like Goldie
If the bitch think I love her, the bitch don't know me
{*laughing*}
[50 Cent] Sorry Kim
[Slim Shady] Oh Sorry, Oh
[Hook]

[Intro]
There's an intruder.. in my house
He cut my phone line.. can't dial out
I scream for police.. but I doubt
They're gonna hear me.. when I shout
[Verse 1]
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail
But this time, when I get pulled over
There's a Doberman Pinscher and a pitbull in the seat
These pigs'll get bit foolin with me, quit foolin with me
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'mma be the wrong one
You wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass
Flashin that flashlight on my ass, where was you at
Last night when them assholes, ran up on my grass?
Rapper slash actor,
 
kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass
They took away my right to bear arms
What I'm 'posed to fight with bare palms?
Yeah right, they comin with bombs, I'm comin with flare guns
We as Americans
[Hook]
We as a Americans, us as a citizen
Gotta protect ourselves, look at how shit has been
We better check ourselves, livin up in these streets
Through worse and through better health,
 
survivin by any means
We as Americans, us as a citizen
We are samaritans, what do we get us in
We better check ourselves, look at how shit has been
Take a look where you live,
 
this is America
And we are Americans
[Verse 2]
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin beaucoup vests
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest
With you know who,
 
with an S tatooed to my chest
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin quicker
Than makin paper airplanes out of a twenty
, 
fuck money!
I don't rap for dead presidents; I'd rather see the president *dead*
It's never been said, but I set precedents
And the standards and they can't stand it
My name shoulda been bastard,
 
the shit shoulda been plastered
On my forehead with a stamp,
 
I shoulda been blasted
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it
I'm too old to go and
 
cruise Gratiot,
 
fuck that shit
I done seen how fast this rap shit
Can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click
But this time they got fuckin auto-ma-tic
Ain't no one gon' test this mon, clack-click!
[Hook]
[Eminem]
(sshhhhh)
I got a secret if you can keep it between us
I tuck two nina's
 
under my jeans either side of my penis
Under my longjohns, under my Sean Johns
When runnin with the long arm of the law I'm long gone
I'mma do five years,
 no less than that, no questions asked
So it might be a good idea to stop right here
And quit while I'm ahead,
 
already in the red
Already got a steady infrared meant for my head
A target on my back, bigger problems than that
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack
They ain't gon' gimme my semi but I got my mac back
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, 
weed lacer
, 
97 burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the Mercury Tracer
I’m on some loced shit, some fed up with the bein’ broke shit
I’m not to joke with,
 
bitch I don’t sell crack, I smoke it
Havin' a coke fit
, 
goin' through withdrawals daily
Shoot up with mescaline in front of my
 
baby daughter Hailie
My brain’s dusted
, 
I’m disgusted at all my habits
Too many aspirin tablets,
 
empty medicine cabinets
Losin' battles to wack rappers cause I’m always too blunted
Walkin’ up in the cypher smokin’, talkin’ about “Who want it?”
Thug and a crook; 
every drug in the book I’ve done it
My 9’s at your brain, is that you chain? run it
Crews die from an overdosage of excessive flavor
Aggressive nature got me stickin’ you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, 
battle rap manufacturer
Stole your momma’s Acura
, wrecked it, and sold it back to her
Boostin’ Nike jackets
, escaped from psychiatrics
Told the nurse to save my bed for me, I might be back trick
So barricade your entrance, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
Chasin’ dips – take ‘em on long vacation trips
Kidnappin’ ‘em and trappin’ ‘em in abusive relationships
Fuck up your face and lips, slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you with that razor that I use to shave my nuts with
Mama, don’t you cry, your son is too far gone
I’m so high, I don’t even know what label I’m on
I’m fucked up, I feel just like an overworked plumber
I’m sick of this crap, what’s Dr. Kevorkian’s phone number?

[Refrain x4]
Put it on my wee-wee
Banana, strawberry, pineapple, orange
[Verse 1]
Got a dick as big as a banana
I try to control it but I guess I can't
It shoots off like an AK-clip banana
You better watch out, Hannah Montana
Man what's the matter, have you no manners
No you know the girl from Juno's address
Yeah, I'mma probably go to jail for that
Now I got the cops on my tail for that
Run up on your car with a stale banana
In your tail pipe, can't believe you fell for that
It coulda' been a 
molotov cocktail
 for that
Wait a minute man, what the hell was that
I heard a noise, where you going
What are you, bananas
You can't go back there, stupid ass
I just seen a woman in a Freddy Kruger mask
Who the fuck are you, Superman
All you have is a little stupid can of whipped cream
What the hell you gonna do with that
I'mma put it on my wee-wee
Oh good answer
Super bonanza extravaganza
Man go ahead, what you waiting for
You better get them clothes off, baby boy
Come on let's go, we're gonna make a porn
Ready, set, go h
Hit play, record
[Refrain]
[Verse 2]
Are you ready
You better hold the camera steady
She's probably back there with a damn machete
She's probably gonna eat you like canned spaghetti
She's probably gonna kill you, still wanna check see
Have a little quick look, go on sick prick
She's probably six foot tall like Big Foot
The hell with that, we probably should run
Don't dare look back
We probably, probably, probably
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
But you probably didn't know that, did you
Now what you gonna do when she gets you
I ain't going with you, forget you
Quit tryna hold my hand, mista
Pretend she's your little sista, little sista
Might as well take the whipped cream with you
And when you see her, make sure you get a picture
We could try to make another Blair Witch movie
A beastiality porno with smoothies
[Refrain]
[Verse 3]
It's eerie, but here comes Zack and Miri
)
Beauty and the beast, his back is hairy
But she don't care, they're attractive, very
Very sexually active, very
No, Zack, don't go back in there
It's too late now, she's grabbing hair
He screams, bloody Mary, grabs a mirror
But stop just ain't in her vocabular
Get off me, please
Get off me, stop
Balling back at a coffee shop
They go non-stop
She says go
He says no
She says oh
Back and forth, they scream and shout
Yeah, boy, let them demons out
It's the kind of nightmare you dream about
Uh-oh, now the whipped cream is out
I get sick thoughts, sick, sick, thoughts
Things you could do with your lipstick gloss
Put it on my dick til the tip looks orange
Bitch, keep going
Bitch, keep going
[Refrain]
[Outro]
Banana, banana, banana, banana, banana

This beat, you hear it bangin', he produced it himself
My bad, almost forgot to introduce myself
My name is Trick Trick
, head of the 
Goon Sqwad
And gangsta been bangin' the underground since '95
, we're bangin'
Elected to be the villain
 and certified a menace
Holdin' it down since I paroled up outta prison
You heard about me, you just didn't know it was me
All the treacherous, evil deeds of the D you never see
Pickin' that kid up in the game,
 
I just wasn't chasin' the fame
I been chasin' the paper product and givin' lames the pain
Accusations of violence you know you done heard of that
A quarter of a million dollars for beatin' a murder rap
And my boy holdin' me up, Shady done put it out
Trick Trick and Eminem, Detroit back in the house
[Hook - Eminem]
[Verse 3 - Trick Trick]
Ayo Em, you ever need one of these weapons come get it
From now on every beef that you get in, homie I'm in it
I been ridin' for this city, whether wrong or right
I been whippin' on motherfuckers for the longest time
So it's evident, it's time for Trick to get it fast
The public, see they appreciate my criminal past
Authorities tried to stop me but they couldn't keep up
Got a fan-base that's bigger then an average star
I'm satisfied with it bein' my time to shine
And I freak from the precinct for violent crimes
I ain't sayin' the shit that I'm sayin' so girls can feel me
Only speakin' on what I know so the world can hear me
So peace to
 
Jimmy
 and 
Dre
 for signin' 
my nigga
He reached back to Detroit and grabbed a winner
So the gangstas and thugs, we embrace with love
And beat the hell outta anybody that fucks with us
[Hook - Eminem]
[Outro]
Yeah, Trick Trick
Eminem, Wonder Boy
, 
Shady
It's goin' down baby
Ayo Em, I got you back my nigga
Damn right I said my nigga
That's my nigga
Tricky

[Eminem]
Yo, speed racer, 97' burgundy Blazer
Wanted for burglary, had to ditch the mercury tracer
I'm on some low ish
I'm fed up wit the being broke ish
I'm not to joke wit
Bitch, I don't sell crack, I smoke it
My brains dusted; I'm disgusted at all my habits
Too many asprin tablets and empty medicine cabinets
Loosing battles to wack rappers cause I'm always too blunted
Walkin' up in the cypher smokin', talkin' like, "Who want it?"
Thug and crook; every drug in the book I've done it
My 9's at your frame,is that your chain? Run it
Who wants to die of an overdose of excessive flavor?
Aggressive nature got me stickin' you for your Progressive pager
Spectacular, battle rap manufacturer
Stole your mom's Acura, wrecked it, then sold it back to her
( Right right right ! ! ! ) (( Ding ! ! ! ))
The doctors you'll need after our battle are known as psychiatrics
I'll tell the nurses to hold a bed for you
And I'mma make sure you come back for it
So barricade your infants, put up some extra fences
A woman beater, wanted for repeated sex offenses
 ( Ooh )
..Take em' on long vacation trips
Kidnappin' em' and trappin' em' in abusive relationships
Mess up your face and lips
Slit your stomach and watch your gut split
Gut you wit that razor that I use to shave my nuts wit
 ((Laughter))
Mama don't you cry, your son's too far gone
I'm so high, I don't even know what label I'm on
I'm messed up, feelin' like an over worked plumber
I'm sick of the crap, what's Dr. Kevorkian's phone number?
 ( Ha.. Hot )

[Hook - Eminem]
Welcome to D-Block, the city of broke down dreams
Where things ain't always peachy keen as they seem
City of dope dealers, killers, pimps, pushers
Panhandlers, hustlers and doped out fiends
The sun don't shine here, in this part of town
But we all got a town that's similar to this too
Say every city's got a ghetto, every ghetto's got a hood
Take a good look around you cause there's a D-Block near you
[Verse 1 - Jadakiss]
Place where ain't nobody that proud, 
it's a fucking black cloud
That got people under the impression they can act wild
Working around though, cause if you can pull a trigger on the pound yo
5 minutes flat, the whole town know
Lotta assuming in niggas' salary
More lies than truth definitely more rumors than reality
Only way you beating a body is technicality
Other than that catch 'em in Clinton on the gallery
The determination and dedication and discipline
Listening and catching the jewels that you was missing
And they still doing coward shit
You know the hate is gonna always be heavy but the love overpowers it
Something in the air but 
the older they get
They kill you quicker over a girl than over a brick
We don't play with the lizards
, 
we make phrases up and say 'em exquisite
Anytime you can pay us a visit
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Eminem]
Welcome to D-Block, the mighty mighty D-Block
The place in New York City where Diddy won't even walk
Its D-Block, the part of Yonkers
 
I wouldn't be caught
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket
D-Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walking
Stick up kids every block who watch for every opportunity
As soon as you leave out that jewelry shop
And you won't even notice your mind will be so
Preoccupied with that new watch you just copped
You won't even see that ride pulling up alongside you
You'll be shot 'fore you even realize you were spied on for three blocks
D-Block the place where O.G.'s get knocked, locked up
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked
You won't even see cops, 
hip-hop police don't even stop
On D-Block, where everybody wants to be 'Pac
And you can get popped over the new G-Unit Reeboks
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Sheek Louch]
If you bust and your gun got niggas on the run
And you rep where you from nigga you D-Block
And you trying to come up and your pockets is light as a cup
And don't give a fuck, you D-Block
Aiyo bang bang nigga, let's get it on
Always been a monster, but its worse now that my son's been born
And every nigga where I be, I put in work for free
It's D-Block mothafucka, 
hey yo grab this P
[Verse 4 - Styles P]
Welcome to D-Block, a place where little niggas is killas
And the mother's raising the sons to turn into gorillas
And the hallways is pissy as hell
, 
all we do is get bigger
More ignorant, you send us to jail
My niggas shoot anything that'll move
Sell drugs, from the rise to the sun to the fall of the moon
I'd die the way I stand with my man if I can when the shells come
This is D Block, ya'll welcome

[Intro - Eminem]
Guess who? Do you miss me?
Jessica Simpson: sing the chorus
[Hook - Charmagne Tripp]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me
You're the one they adore
Who they came to see
You're a... rock star
Everybody wants you, player
Who can really blame you?
We're the ones who made you
[Verse 1]
Ahem, back by popular demand
Now pop a little Zantac for antacid if you can
You're ready to tackle any task that is at hand
How does it feel? Is it fantastic? Is it grand?
Well, look at all the massive masses in the stands
"Shady man, no, don't massacre the fans!"
Damn, I think Kim Kardashian's a man
She stomped him just cause he asked to put his hands
On her massive gluteus maximus again
Squeeze it and squish it and pass it to a friend
Can he come back as nasty as he can?
Yes he can-can: don't ask me this again
He does not mean to lesbians offend
But Lindsay: please come back to seeing men
Samantha's a 2; you're practically a 10
I know you want me, girl; in fact, I see you grin
Now come in, girl
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
The enforcer, looking for more women to torture
Walk up to the cutest girl and Charlie-horse her
Sorry Portia, but what's Ellen DeGeneres
Have that I don't? Are you telling me tenderness?
Well, I can be as gentle and as smooth as a gentleman
Give me my Ventolin inhaler, and 2 Xenadrine
And I'll invite Sarah Palin out to dinner then
Nail her, baby: "say hello to my little friend"
Brit: forget K-Fed, let's cut off the middleman
Forget him or you're gonna end up in the hospital again
And this time it won't be for the Ritalin binge
Forget them other men, girl, pay them little attention
And little did I mention that Jennifer's in
Love with me, John Mayer, so sit on the bench
Man, I swear them other guys, you give em an inch
They take a mile, they got style, but it isn't Slims
[Hook]
[Eminem - singing]
And that's why, my love, you'll never live without
I know you want me girl cause I can see you're checking me out
And baby, you know, you know you want me too
Don't try to deny it baby, I'm the only one for you (*fart*)
[Verse 3]
Damn girl, I'm beginning to sprout an Alfalfa
Why should I wash my filthy mouth out?
You think that's bad you should hear the rest of my album
Never has there been such finesse and nostalgia
Man Cash, I don't mean to mess with your gal but
Jessica Alba put her breasts on my mouth (blup!)
Wowzers! I just made a mess in my trousers
And they wonder why I keep dressing like Elvis
"Lord help us, he's back in his pink Alf shirt
Looking like someone shrinked his outfit!"
I think he's 'bout to flip, Jessica
Rest assured Superman's here to rescue ya
Can you blame me? You're my Amy, I'm your Blake
Matter fact, bake me a birthday cake
With a saw blade in it to make my jailbreak
Baby, I think you just met your soulmate
Now break it down, girl
[Outro]
Amy! Rehab never looked so good!
I can't wait, I'm going back
Ha ha, woo! Dr. Dre! 2020!

My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth
I’m just a nerd cursed with badly Disturbed nerves
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first
99 percent of aliens prefer Earth
So I'm here to rule the planet, Startin' with your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
With smeared letters runnin' together in blurred spurts
I hang with male chauvinist pigs and perverts
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's
My first words were bleep bleep and Curse curse
Never had shit and I still don’t deserve dirt
My breath still stinks and I’m on my third cert
Yanking out my stitches, and hollering "nurse nurse"
"You said this shot would numb it, bitch this just hurts worse!"

Teats and Thurston Howell, and yelling Wordsworth
My mother smoked crack I had a premature birth
I'm just a nerve purse with badly disturbed nerves
You wanna be the one to step up and get served first
99% of aliens prefer Earth
Come here to rule the planet, storm on your turf
I hid a secret message inside of a word search
With smeared letters, runnin together and blurs spurts
Hang with male shovenest pigs and perverts
I point water pistols at women and squirt shirts
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerbers
My first words were bleep bleep and curse curse
Never had shit and I still don't deserve dirt
My breath still stinks, and I'm on my third cert
Digging out my stitches, and hollering nurse nurse!
You said this shot would numb me this shit just hurts worse!

"When I bust on the mic, I bust a real hard rhyme" ---] Keith Murray
[Verse 1: Da Ruckus]
I'm rockin shit, packin shit, while stackin shit
If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit
You gone phase me, 
but swingin like Peter Parker
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up
You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback
"You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack"
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid
And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade
Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies
So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies
You're played like my five-year old's newborn toys
Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz
Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways
Thats rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days
Listen up, all these words take heed
When I cock and squeeze, no more MC's breathe (none)
I'm sick of this, here's my final diss
Fuck you dumb niggas you ain't shit like piss
[Hook] - 2X
[Eminem]
My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy
Got your family lookin for your ass on Sally Jessy
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more
Leavin your skull split like Steven Seagal
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a mad house
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed
We quick to pull the gat out and set it
And leave you with more shit missin than a Lil' Kim radio edit
Stick up kids be tryin to live paid
You get your crib sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your ribcage
Get the guage, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack
Or I'mma send you flyin like a rocketpack
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack
Break into your crib steal your shit and lock it back
Ten-year old kids be standin on the block with gats
Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats
Where I'm from...yaknow what'm sayin?, that's some old Detroit shit
Y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. Less you come
To my city, ya know what'm sayin? See where we live
Cause we shine
[Hook] - 2X
[Hush]
MC's put Detroit up in they rap songs
Cause without us their careers wouldn't last long
So like a generation we've been passed on
Now its our time to shine, put your glasses on
Got these A & R's and labels with binoculars
Lookin in, jockin us and not jockin yours
Too many groups follow trends, unoriginal
Usin loops that transcend every bitch in you
Don't ever try to say this is a ghost town
One million rappers in this bitch, they need to slow down
Evaluate the situation, all the rest are killers
Fly hoes out on Jefferson with the drug dealers
Two years in the joint, nobody's touchin Hush
Try to say you'll put us down, but your under us
Now who the fuck are you? its just coincidental
When your rhyme your even worse than the instrumental
Your just a phone-tapper with no backbone
Talkin shit, I got a clique that only pack chrome
Have your ass gone, nowhere to run, when we hit
Next time you'll think twice of who you fuckin wit
[Hook] - 3 and 1/4X

[Verse 1: Mr. Porter]
Welcome to the ill world of
 
Mr. P-O
Aye keep the talk B; I'm tryna see dough
If it ain't about bread, what we gon' speak fo
If it ain't no lead, then it ain't no beef, bro
You better get a leash cause your freak ho
Specialize in wood like she Home Depot
I'm like Chico DeBarge, we stars
Roscoe P. Coltrane in these bars, man
Amtrak,
 
I'll break her damn back, man
It's Ralph Lauren, this ain't no damn Chaps
It's all Polo; I'm so pro though
You bird-crazy: El Pollo Loco
Talking bout cheese and this ain't no photo
Asking bout rings like the ho know Frodo
You better get out of my house and shit
I think I threw up in my mouth a bit,
 
I'm sick
[Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"]
Niggas be lying, talking 'bout that, bust a heater
Once I see him, maybe more like Justin Bieber
Leaving my rivals underground like Skyzoo's, how I do
I have her laying in the street and bleeding
Butt naked with a bullet in his muthafucking head like Erykah Badu
I find irony in being in a place
Where I'm wearing Gucci, mayne; getting White boy wasted
I tell a nigga, break bread or take lead
I'm tryna get rid of this weight like K-Fed
Me and Denaun got a gangsta bond
We like that once-in-a-lifetime thang to you that ain't the prom
The next MC that rhyme official with ref with a whistle
That ain't Young Money, I'mma definitely diss you
If you rhyming packing a Mac with back of the Acura
Or perhaps you can't match my spectacular vernacular
You still rhyming bottles with models, college for knowledge
Using the word swagger, you're probably garbage
You thugs funny, comparing 5'9" to anybody
You comparing Superman to Bugs Bunny
[Verse 3: Eminem]
I'm like a White Michael - Vick
Psycho enough to stick
Michael J. Fox in a microwave with a Rott
I might make a little Alizé with a side of NyQuil
And ride a motorcycle bike right through the side of my high school
Satan's disciple with a sniper rifle and a knife and a white diaper
Liable to shit on you while I snipe you
So dope he gets off opiates
What an appropriate
Way to start off his day
He may just smart off to Dre
He may be hard to contain
Cause his rage is so hard to gauge
See Hannibal ate his face
And met Jason, gnawed off his leg
Amazing hard-on for razors and blades and anything sharp
Even poisonous darts
It all plays a major part of his game
Holy water won't ward him off
Crucifixes won't do the trick
He's so sick, it's ridiculous
Sawed the crazy part off his brain
He's still insane
Why's there bloodstains on his carpet, mane
There's some crazy shit going on in Shady's apartment again
[Verse 4: Mr. Porter]
Okay, it's back to the blocks, slinging yay like the old days
Superman on the beat, I carry my whole state
You wooden legs to a house: you can't hold weight
Oh shit, it's O'Shea Jackson...okay
A little bit of this twisted out with Obama in it
Mr. Porter back with anthrax like Osama sent him
Bitch, I'm all that; I drive the girls crazy
They gotta look at Rorschachs to get they thoughts back
I ain't a small fry, small ticker, small tack
I make 'em all cry with big dick and raw sack
The potblood of science to return a raw rap
I'm the best mayne: Eli Porter stance
[Verse 5: Royce da 5'9"]
Y'all bitches should call Nickle the Don Bishop
A poet, a mixer of Don Goines and John Grisham
Flow'll have you rewinding it four or five times
That landmine rhyme written with porcupine line
Step up in here with the Slaughterhouse
C.O.B. Gang will approach you and bend ya gun barrel to a Horseshoe
Only fuck wit monsters
, we the truth, 
monsters will pop up on you
Like you said Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I can't even see the booth, I could fit Stevie's shoe
I'm sick,
 
I got the Desert Eagle flu
I'm rich lil' nigga we don't need a cent,
 
we Teflon
The doctor tried to take blood, the needle bent,
 
ask mom
Outta my mind if you can imagine
Using Magic's johnson without a condom, I'm bonkers
Got the streets going, dude, it's tremendous
If I come for ya blood, I ain't gon' be using syringes
[Verse 6: Eminem]
Newsflash, I'm still trashed
Them pills should'a killed my ass
But they didn't
They just made me stronger
It's like they rebuilt my ass
Like the Six Million Dollar Man after the crash
It's Aftermath, bitch
 
and my milk glass is still half-empty
Yeah tempt me
Hell isn't enough
They need to invent somewhere new to send me
As sick as I'm getting
They'll stick me in a conventional oven
With a rotisserie setting and won't even notice me sweating
Shit, I done made a verse, said some foul shit
Tryna go back fix it
Fucked around and just made it worse
Yeah, I'm back
Looking no worse for wear
Got these haters mad enough to rip off their hair and start punching the air
Panties so in a bunch that they can't function
It's Shady and Royce
Fuck yeah, what a dysfunctional pair
So stop acting like a punk, get a pair
Take a pill and fall the fuck out
Spill ya lunch in the chair
[Verse 7: Mr. Porter]
Look I'm sick, somebody better get the Dimetapp
Who I gotta shoot just to prove that I can rap
People ask where my shine is at
I say check the liner notes, I done done all kinda crap
I am so much of a star, bitch
That I can fart and piss on the red carpet
Look, my bank account's retarded
My debit card's got a helmet and a harness, hey
Meet demands but they all are harmless
At shows, my riders always the largest
I need four pounds of fried poultry carcass
And red M&Ms chartered from Charlotte
Look, and if you try to act dumb and start shit
I just yell at em like, I'm the artist
In fact that you know the deal
If you wanna play sick, we can all get ill
Look: measles, mumps, I made you bitches
I don't need you chumps,
 
y'all got cheese and I need my chunks
Hurry up, so I can go to burn rubber and get some more dunks
[Verse 8: Royce da 5'9"]
Now if your attitude determines your latitude
This house that we call hip-hop, I'm in the attic fool
A mic and two turntables, fit for the unstable
Converted to a padded room,
 
keep a street sweeper in fact
I call the mag a broom,
 
you seeing beef, seeing things
You must'a had yourself a bag of shrooms,
 I make a call
Make 'em fake a fall, my clique is too sick, say goodbye
In the streets where the stakes is high like Ruth's Chris
I'm from the city of true shit
Where the mayor went to jail for being a player right after Proof split
Levels the head of competitors Royce that
I'm drinking everyday til Hex Murda get his regular voice back
Ras, I got ya
, look scared at ya, blast from ya
From a block away; ask Tricky, I'm that niggie
I'm mo hooder than black Dickies
I rap like committing suicide in the booth taking the track with me
Patrón's in my chromosomes,
 
in order to leave it alone
You have to ween me off
 
that Lorena Bobbitt chopper'd
Knock a weenie off,
 
put your body between chalk
I'm squeezing the nine iron like I'm swinging golf
I'm with the best rapper alive, put something on it
Your sound's plain as a cheeseburger with nothing on it
[Verse 9: Eminem]
I'll do a hundred-yard dash just to slash Kim Kardash' in the ass
With a shard of glass from Nick Hogan's car crash
You may look like the passenger for that, don't be a smartass
Yeah, laugh while you sit there thinkin' that the hard part passed
You ain't seen pain 'til Leatherface flips, mayne
I'll cut ya fucking balls off homie
My saw's off the chain
I chopped the bitch in half with it, sawed off her legs
And the top half of the torso fucking crawled off insane
I ain't seen shit like that since I went to Mike Jack's
Took the Elephant Man's skull
Fucked it, and put it right back
Handed my dick to Bubbles while he sucked it and licked my nut sack
Gave him a reach-around while I fucked him right in his butt crack
Nah I ain't takin' it back faggot, fuck that
I give a fuck about nothin'
So here's where you fucked up at
Don't go touchin' that can, man
You don't wanna open up that
Wait a min, 
 
ah, shit...Alchemist, cut that

So let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around

But we just gon sit back for a minute and watch what the fuck yall do

[Hook: Eminem]
Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
Take some Big and some Pac and mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, what the fuck do you got?
Fifty!
Big and, Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Mix them up in a pot, mix them up in a pot
It's Big and some pac and you mix em up and you got

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I got a gambling problem
I bet you niggas I'mma be back bustin'
But you won't notice me when that gat dumpin', you wan' bet?
I lost money when I bet on Roy
Won money when I bet on Floyd,
 I'm the one that bet on boy
Undefeated, eyes low like I'm weeded
I bet you niggas think I won't be number one again
I raise the stakes, you know why I put mo' on the line
It's showtime I'm goin' for my mine, you can bet that
I bet that tech jam before that mac
I bet that dope go before that crack,
 
I bet my money stack
I bet yo bitch wanna roll with 50
I bet if I said I'm going to the hotel she'd go with me
I bet you really love her man you think she wouldn't come
She got your pussy wooped, 
her head game, it got you sprung
I'm taking all bets, 
through all sets I be a bookie
That have to be ten percent off the top, fucking rookies
[Hook]
[50 Cent]
Fifty! (fifty!) Ohhhh! (Ohhh)
I wanna bet y'all niggas, it ain't gon' be
The old niggas like me!
Trust me, I came up hard! (came up hard!)
All you gotta do is go through my hood
Southside, 
niggas like me all up and down there
On the corners, in the penitentiary, they from southside
Yeah, they ain't on the top of the charts
They don't know the formula, they ain't on the hot 500
They like me!
[Hook]

[Eminem]
Yo I got an idea
Let me go grab Sticky right quick
**sounds of steps**
Hey yo Stick, Stick
[Sticky]
Yo Slim Shady
Yo I just had like a nightmare..
Wait it wasn't like a nightmare
It was like a good dream..
Well it wasn't a good.. (What was it?)
Hey yo I just had a crazy dream man (What?)
Yo, yo I dreamed I was white! (Ohhh)
Chorus: Eminem
If he was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
Verse One: Sticky Fingaz
Yo, yo
What if I was white skin the same color as Cocaine?
Blond hair, blue eyes
The whole shabang
I know one thing
Police wouldn't always be watching me
Pull me over for nothing, constantly jockin' me
(
Can I get your autograph?
)
Yellow cabs in the cities that stop for me
I wouldn't need collateral to buy property
If I was white
Wouldn't matter if I was rich or poor
SECURITY wouldn't follow me around the store
Like I'd steal something (Maybe he might of stole something)
Because I'm black I rob
And automatically assume I ain't got no job
On my own land I feel like an immigrant
If I was white
I wouldn't thought O.J. was innocent (He did it)
Chorus: Eminem
If I was white
What if he was white?
What if he was white? (Yo think about that)
What if he was white, white, white, white, he was white (for a minute)
What if he was white?
What if he was (What if he was white?)
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white? (What if
He was white?)
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if you were white? (what if he was white?)
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white,(STICKY, what if you were white?) white
White
White, white, white?
Verse Two: Sticky Fingaz
If I was white
It would be a different world for me
If I was white (ummmmmmmm?)
What shade would I be?
Would I be Redneck or Skinhead, preppy or high class?
(YOU PROBABLY LIVE IN A TRAILER PARK AND BE WHITE TRASH!)
In any case that be the ill shit right? (Yep)
But there's a good and bad out of being white
You can't say the N word without starting a fight (What's up, my nigger?)
True dance it'll be, I had two left feet
Even if I was white
Plaque still have a ghetto shit(How you doing?)
Is it a myth
Or do I really have a little dick (Nah, it's true!)
If I was white
I would probably listen to hardcore rock
And covered my ears when ever I heard Hip Hop (Ahhhhhhhhhhhh)
Chorus: Eminem
Verse Three: Sticky Fingaz
Yo,yo,yo, if I was white
I probably wouldn't even think the same
I watched Tennis and golf and bet on Hockey games (Red Wings Man)
Wear suit and ties and go to work everyday
If I was white
I couldn't live around my way
In it probably wouldn't never even been an Onyx shit
I be serice sippin vodka and tonics
Smokin on them all on a Marlboro
Instead of a Newport
I live in Long Island
Instead of New York
If I was white
I probably couldn't dunk
Cuz everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the tree spots
Cuz all the niggas trend think I was a cop
Chorus: Eminem
What if you were white?
What if he was white?
What - If - He - Was - White?
What if he was white?
What if he was
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?
If he was white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white
(What would you do if you were white?)
What - If - He - Was - White?
(What if you were white?)
White, white, white, white, white, white
(What if you were white!!!!)
White, white, white, white?
What if he was white?
What if he was white?
White, white, white, white, white?
What if he was white
White, white, white, white, white, white, white, white?

In any case that be the ill shit right?
But there's a good and bad side of being white

Couldn't dance to a beat, I'd have two left feet
Even if I was white, probably still have a ghetto shit (How you doing?)

I be somewhere sipping Vodka and Tonix
Smoking on a Marlboro instead of a Newport
I'd live in Long Island instead of New York
If I was white, I probably couldn't dunk
Cause everybody knows white man can't jump (Nope!)
And probably wouldn't be able to go to the weed spot
Cause all of the dreads would think I'm a cop

[Intro]
What's the difference between me and you
[Verse 1 - Dr. Dre]
Back when Cube
 
was rolling with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils
Got down to business; but sometimes
The business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga
I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
Cause you my nigga Doc, and Eazy I'm still wit'chu
Fuck the beef, nigga I miss you
And that's just being real wit'chu
You see the truth is
Everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then I got these fake-ass niggas I first drew with
Claimin' that they non-violent, talkin' like they {*voice sample*}
Spit venom in interviews, speaking on reunions
Move units, then talk shit and we can do this
Until then - I ain't even speaking your name
Just keep my name outta yo' mouth and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference
[Hook]
What's the difference between me and you
You talk a good one
But you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting
[Verse 2 - Xzibit]
Yo I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate and play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers baby-sitted
I smash you critics like a overhand right from Riddick (yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catching feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you
 (c'mon)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid
Never come down, pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you (what)
About five bank accounts
Three ounces and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold yo' breath 'til ain't none left
Yo that's the difference
[Hook]
[Eminem]
Aight, hold up hold up
STOP THE BEAT A MINUTE
I got somethin' to say
Dre, I wanna tell you this shit right now
While this fucking weed is in me
(What the fuck)
I don't know if I ever told you this, but I love you dawg
I got your motherfucking back (right) just know this shit
[Dr. Dre]
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one
 
nigga
Let's blow this bitch
[Eminem]
I mean it dawg
You ever need somebody offed
Whose throat is it?
[Dr. Dre]
Well if you ever kill that Kim bitch
I'll show you where the ocean is
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Well that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's momma
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin at people (hi)
Then drop her off on the corner
At the police station and drive off honkin' the horn for her
Raw dawg, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed off
And beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub
 
'til the bubbles pop up
And they nose and cough snot up
Mucus in hot water
That's for trying to talk like "The Chronic" was lost product
That's for even thinking of having them thoughts thought up
You better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us
We can start at the penis
Or we can scream
"I just don't give a fuck!" and see who means it

[Intro]
What's the difference between me and you (repeat 2x)
[Verse 1 - Dr. Dre]

You talk a good one
But you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to living big dog style and straight coasting
[Verse 2 - Hittman]
The difference is: I don't care
Can't you tell it by my witched stare?
I'm legendary, get you open like a frigid dare
More despair, 
Your style’s dead as Fred Astaire
You need medicare, security blanket and a fucking teddy bear
Awh Yeah Awh Yeah
It's your expression when you're out with succession
Vocal bitch making impressions like Jerry Butler
Stupid Fucker, I will cut ya
Doing yourself such a tragedy, I will run you ragged like (?)
You kick the pink hair like a faggot man
New styles, I usually keep clans destine
Like piles of seamen found in (?) intestines
No question
But keep that on the low low, For (?) slow mo
When puffing marijuana can't get the time of day
Now I'm fucking nigga's Mommas
Drama's still part of my dietary
(?)
Kill your daughter, bust her cherry
[That is all I can make out of these lyrics, the music isn't that clear enough
If you can make out the lyrics, PLEASE edit them and finish them]

Why I keep on ducking under the bed when I hear thunder
Cause I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil
Maybe I like that! I'm only as crazy as people made me
Believe me, there'll be just as many mutherfucking murderers
And heroin users without Marilyn's music
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it
Now the parents are suing cause little Darren is screwing
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up
Cause of me? Two 12-year old girls is knocked up
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point
Wanna come join? Pick up a Glock and just point
Now everybody's killing everybody and everybody's bloody
And I'm just laughing like it's funny
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-motherfucking-body
I'm so motherfucking nutty, I don't give a fuck about nothing

[Intro]
Yeah
It's my life
In my own words, I guess
[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gon' write itself
I'll give you one underdog
 
then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me
, 
but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby
[Hook]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time
"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cause man I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me,
 
Help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you Daddy
, you told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are going"
But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice
"Now go up there and
 
show 'em that you love 'em more than us
"
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word,
 
k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that 
the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream "Die Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her
, Hailie just smiles and winks at 
her little sister
Almost as if to say
[Hook]
*Curtains Closing*

[Eminem]
Nothing can stop and nothing can change it
You better just make new livin' arrangements
If you think, you're the top and king of the castle
You're about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that
But I don't hear my name, no ne'er brought up in rap
And I don't usually trip or dare get caught up in that
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought of as that
Not even the same league as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe
They'll name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z
Ayo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi-O
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily
And that very well maybe
The same reason they don't say me
When they speak on hip-hop legends which has amazed me
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby
[Obie Trice]
So maybe the eighties made me crazy
I've been tryin to get my weight up since the ace Slim Shady
Gave me the gate key, paved the way
So lately, my stakes get better each day
Replay my relay race, when I was chasin the afee at eighteen
Eight years later his voice in Beijing
No choice I chase cream, so
[Eminem] 
SHAAADDYYY!!!(STAT QUO!)We're back!
[Stat Quo]
This is what I eat, sleep and breath and feed my kids
Would it fulfill all my family needs
 (c'mon)
I treat the mic like the block
Fuck with my rocks, and squeeze
Critics expecting me to underachieve
I just deal with the hate I recieve
By rolling back my sleeves
Sure was a breeze, I bring him right to his knees
And tell him "suck my dick"
I take a bow and leave
With a sack full of unmarked cheese
I find it hard to believe
Who to pull or proceed
To be G's and claim they runnin shit
Nigga I run me
As a kid, teacher said I had a mouth on me
The same mouth got me the deal with Dre and E
Folk in the hood be askin, where I be
Dogg, I'm out in Hawaii
Don't like it? drink my pee
Record song for the "Detox" LP
Feet don't fail me
Niggas got me bent like Cranberry and Belvee
I'mma die wealthy
Boss in the game, what the fuck they gon tell me?
A towns auntre, 
Aftermath
, 
Shady
!
[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(BOBBY CREEK!)We're back!
[Bobby Creekwater]
Y'all market y'all block, they sent me to corner that
Rap game's an old flame, my nigga I want 'em back
Like mic check
Pimp for what it's worth I got the right net
Sittin' here excited by some shit that ain't right yet
No regret, live by a code you don't know bout
Y'all niggas won't be certified till I show I
Go out on a limb with Em cause I'm wid him
Put a barrel to the apparel of you and some of them
Stand a chance, at the dance, without a Bow tie
Shady Records re-introduce you niggas to Mow-ti
So high, of the light that they have given me
And the haters like a shofurr because it's driven me
To a view with a vendetta I am the apitomee
I don't give a fuck about ya nigga I'm just livin me
We the reason for the season so I'm breezin through the track
Nigga
[Eminem] SHAAADDYYY!!!(CA$HIS!)
[Ca$his]
I can prove I'm here to do something you never do
From hand to hand coke sales, from my revenue
I ain't been to a function, where I ain't snuck a weapon through
Cause my background reveals a one eight seven too
To the block, I'm the truth
To the cops, I'm the proof of this
And niggas still out there, you just gotta shoot
I carry over my street ethics, to the booth
And the shady crime fam, Al Capone in his youth
The difference between me and you, I already done it
And lived the street life, niggas run away from if
You follow my life, in a midwest blunted
Pitchforks held high, four fifth by the stomach
You can find me right now, on the C.A. streets
I'm on the roof, of the building, shooting at police
Some of the homies feel opposition can't kill me
I'm a walking obituary, death live in me
I take life through the pen, by the way I'mma see
Or have you raped in the pen, like American meat
I'm connected gettin weight from MS 13
With 
S.K's, A.R's and Mini fourteens
I'm Cashis, the last of the real
, with a strap
On Pro-sac, D's and 
E-Pills
, it's a rap
Get the block on tip, two for tens of crack
I'm in a lifetime contract, Shady's back
Nigga
Eminem - SHAAADDYYY!!!(Ha! I Told You We Was Back!)

[Intro: Bizarre]
Music.. reality
Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers.. have a responsibility
To these kids.. psych!
[Eminem]
If I, were to die murdered in cold blood tommorrow
Would you feel sorrow or show love
, 
or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battling
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate, I done came way
Too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for a joke? You smoking crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm trying to smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady trying to drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothing but piss me off,
 
lid to the can of whip-ass
Just twist me off, see me leap out, pull a piece out
Fuck shooting I'm just trying to knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you really feeling froggish leap
Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him 'scape with that
Man I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
[Swifty McVay]
Ain't no gettin rid of McVay, if so you woulda tried
The only way I'm leavin this bitch is suicide
I have died clinically, arrived back at my enemies' crib
With
 
Hennessey
, 
got drunk then I finished it {*BLAM*}
I'm every nigga's favorite arch enemy
Physically fitted to be the most dangerous nigga with beef
I spark willingly
, with a 
dillinger
 in the dark diligently
I'm not what you think
I appear to be fucked up, mentally endangered
I can't stay away from a razor
I just want my face in a paper
I wish a nigga had a grenade to squeeze tight
To awake neighbors for acres
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into a mad man
Son of sam bitch
, 
I'm surgical
I'm allergic to dyin, you think not?
You got balls? We can see how large, when the music stops
[Kon Artis]
I was happy havin a deal at first
Thought money would make me happy but it only made my pain worse
It hurts when you see your friends turn their back on you, dog
And you ain't got nuttin left but your word and your balls
And you're stressed from the calls of your new friends
Beggin with their hands out, checkin for your record when it's sellin
When it ain't that's the end, no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink, till your car spin you think
DAMN! When you slam into the wall
And you fall out the car and try to crawl with one arm
I'm bout to lose it all in a pool of alcohol
If my funeral's tomorrow wonder would they even call?
When the music stops
[Kuniva]
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin for you with a pistol, sippin a can of penzoil
I'm revved up, who said what, when lead bust
Your head just explode with red stuff
, 
I'm handcuffed
Tossed in the paddywagon;
 braggin about how you shouted
Like a coward, bullets devoured you, showered you niggas
If I was you niggas, I'd run while given a chance
Understand, I can enhance the spirit of man
Death itself, it can't hurt me
Just the thought of dyin alone that really irks me
You ain't worthy to speak thoughts of cheap talk
Be smart and stop tryin to walk how G's walk before we spark
Hug the floor while we playin tug-of-war with your life
Fuck a tour and a mic, I'd rather fuck a whore with a knife {AHH!}
Deliver that shit that coroner's like
You hype poppin shit in broad daylight
Nigga you're a goner at night
 
- when the music stops
[Proof]
Instigators
, turn 
pits
 in cages
Let loose and bit the neighbors, wrist to razors
Y'all don't want war, y'all want talk
In the dark my dogs all bark like WOOF!
Proof nigga I'mma wolf,
 
get your whole roof
Caved in like reindeer hoofs
Stomp the booth, shake the floor tiles loose
The more y'all breathe shit the more I moves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore Blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues (nigga)
Or make the news, betcha all y'all move
When the uzi pop you better drop
, when the music stop
[Bizarre]
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to "Rock the Bells"
NWA said "Fuck the Police," now I'm in jail
Ninety-three was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson - who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin Priscilla tonight
Flyin down Sunset smokin crack
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P.
 had me grimey and gritty
Marilyn Manson I dyed my hair blue, and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
Now I'm in the hospital with a broken nose and a fractured elbow
Voices in my head, I'm goin in shock
I'm reachin for the Glock but the music stops
 
{*blam*}

(scratched) (3X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell" -> Mr. Garrison
[Eminem]
Yo
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt
Mom couldn't take me, the bitch still hates me
One day she said, "Go rake leaves," I said, "Make me!"
I'm proud to announce I'm probably the first kid
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth
Arguing with me and mom was on-going
She called the law enforcement when I broke the lawn mower
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince
And him and Jeff were still best friends
, I guess then
I decided to cut class to rap full time
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme
So anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image
You fucking prick!
(scratched) (4X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"
[Pauly Yams]
Yo, y'all rappers have never learned
That's why I'm fuckin wit y'all
Run around telling niggas they can fuck wit Parl
I bring it to your high school, smoke the prom
Put your brother in a headlock, choke your mom
Cause any horror like a play off loss in game seven
Walk around ripping on niggas madder than James Evans
My left hand's sharp it moves freestyle ultra
Slap my dick like Kool Keith
Fuck like you stole from me, and rules the streets
I don't wanna have to fuck you up, so cool cease
Parl Yams be the chosen thug
What I spit be cold juice like a frozen hug
Run the streets while you're stuck at home
My temper like Bushwick Bill, bitch leave me the fuck alone
I've been jealous since niggas was windmillin'
These cats just started to rhyme, my pen's spillin'
Your moms just told me to act, I've been wheelin'
So boy just slow your deck, i've been stealin'
I wet rappers cause it's me and Em
I guess I just ain't give a fuck like Eminem
Burglarize take busts with the slugs
Come in your window like Bruh Man and bustin' your club
Put the heat up I teach them niggas what to suck
And my young lords, when to stand up and light the Dutch
(scratched) (4X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"
[Eminem]
I came to my last show on a horse swingin' a lasso
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that
Two 
Xanax
, and I give a fuck where 
SoundScan
 at
Fuck Billboard, drugs is what I kill for
I'm Happy Gilmore, just slip me anything in pill form
I may mingle but I plan to stay single
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle
Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays
And I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty
As long as my heart beats I'mma keep tryin to see
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep
So "I'm the Rapper, He's the DJ"
I'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin "F/U/C/K"
So Jeff, give me a scratch (scratched: "No!")
The rest of y'all can kiss my ass 'til your lips stick to my pants
(scratched) (5X):
"No...you hear me! You go to hell!"

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah you got me, I’m up now
It’s your loss,
 
must suck to be you
[Verse 1: Eminem]
History is like a chord on no delay
It keeps repeating itself
 and what else can I say
You wondering why I act this way, never shoulda gave you the time of day
Guess you know what time it is now, ay
There musta been a gust of wind, cause you change your mind
Everytime it blows
 
and you just changed it a motherfucking again
You just said you just wanted some dick 'fore I stuck it in
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you,
 
fucking men
You say you don't trust 'em
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushing, some shit is going down
You must have just not have been truthful from the start
See for me it’d be nothing to say you never had my heart but I’d be lying
Fucking see why they call this bullshit a relationship, ships sink
And you know it's love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks
And it feels like everytime I fucking do I get jinxed
Cupid must have put a curse on me
Six weeks have went by and we only spoke twice
I’m sitting in your driveway calling you from the car
Suffice I think it's safe to say you’re not at home
I’m calling your cell phone you answer but I can tell though
That you're not alone
 how was I to know
It shoulda been time to go a long time ago, I kept holding on
It's comical when I think back now why I couldn't get the hint
And feel the draft you were throwing I wasn't catching your drift
But there's a 
cold breeze
 blowing over me
I'm over you, success is the best revenge to pay you back
And that payment is overdue,
 
I overcame odds to get even
The sober me is shitting all over the un-sober you
And I hope they play this in every club that you going to
I’m haunting you bitch everywhere you turn I'm following you
Cause I loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true
It's killing you now, yeah I hope the ho dies slow in you
It's cause of you now I don’t trust ‘em at all, fuck 'em, middle finger up
I’m gonna just keep grabbing my balls, cup 'em
I’ll never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em
So buttercup 
don't try to come back knocking on my door all
 
dolled up
[Hook]
Cause I’m moving on, don’t worry about me
Cause I’m gon' be just fine without you, you’ll see
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I’d much rather be
Cause goddammit I’m glad that I’m me
I said if you could be where I’m at (bye bye)
You’d wanna be you too
 (I'mma be good without you)
If you felt the way I feel
I bet you’d be in as good a mood as I am
But you don’t cause you just feel like you
[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
I’ve had it for the last time, your actions got me hot as my last rhyme
You’re options are leave or put out. 
Granted your ass fine
Fine just ain't gon' cut it
Drama is what you’re in love with, you and them bitches you run with
Lately I’m feeling smothered,
 
you snooped around for dirt to be uncovered
Conceited with cover girl motives,
 I gotta rise above it
You think them models loving me, I’m thinking bout who doesn’t
Doesn’t really matter what you say, sickness in my stomach
Told you I was gon' be splitting, you don’t think I mean it
Left you with everything I got, fuck you, 
ain’t no secret
No apologies you keep it, now that I’m doing my thing and you peep it
The badder times all outweigh the recent
Your energy, who needs it?
 
Every rumor you hear, you go believe it
Point out the times you’ve seen it
You stabbed me should have leaned it,
 revenge is mine, I need it
Need a way out, It’s my fucking life, let her find a way to stay out
Bet you thought I’d break, ain't that easy
Bet you thought I need you a million times before you need me
Leave me everything that I gave to you, ain't no freebies get your coat and go
The female 
Pinocchio
, 
money hungry, hopeless ho
You fucking with my focus so
 
go back to that chump
That played the role before
 
love is like a cancer when you don’t let go
I’mma blow fo sho,
 
unnecessary weight makes the boat go slow
I don’t need you sinking us, hope you float
Lying through my teeth I hope you don’t. Drown! Drown!
Not a sound out her be dope
, bottles pop out while he smoke
Hate we met, proud that we broke
, let them girls crowding me go
If they got something to show, let them show me! I don't love 'em"
Never lonely,
 
never even left a scar
You fell hard,
 
I’m laughing, ha ha ha ha ha
Tire smoke fancy car
Nothing is what we are, no beginning no tomorrow
[Hook]

[Intro]
America, hahaha, we love you
How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours
The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect
The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech
The United States government has sworn to uphold
, 
or so we're told
[Verse 1]
I never woulda dreamed in a million years I'd see
So many motherfuckin' people, who feel like me
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs
It's like a fucking army marching in back of me
So many lives I touched,
 
so much anger aimed
In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days
Who woulda thought, 
standing in this mirror bleaching my hair
With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear
That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord with somebody up in the office
Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, I'm lovin' it
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on
[Hook]
White America,
 
I could be one of your kids
White America,
 
little Eric looks just like this
White America, 
Erica
 
loves my shit
I go to 
TRL,
 
look how many hugs I get
[Verse 2]
Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself
If they were brown Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf
But Shady's cute
, 
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby (ooh baby!) Look at my sales
Let's do the math: if I was black, I woulda sold half
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that
But I could rap, so fuck school,
 
I'm too cool to go back
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin' studio's at
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like, "Fuck it"
Until I met Dre, the only one to look past
Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
, 
every fan black that I got
Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn; we just swapped: sitting back, looking at shit, wow
I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now?
 It's
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids
Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist
Whose mom's probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss
'til I created so much motherfuckin' turbulence
Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came
And kids flipped, when they knew I was produced by Dre
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected with me too because I looked like them
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searching with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope
Waiting to choke; tightening around my throat
Watchin' me while I write this, like I don't like this, NOPE!
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working
Round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely
Hip hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston
After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom
So now I'm catchin' the flak from these activists when they raggin'
Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal
The posterchild, the motherfuckin' spokesman now, for
[Hook]
[Outro]
So to the parents of America
I am the 
derringer
 
aimed at little Erica to attack her character
The ringleader of this circus
 of 
worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the White House
To burn the {flag} and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy
Fuck you Ms. Cheney,
 Fuck you 
Tipper Gore
Fuck you with the free-est of speech
This Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have
Fuck you!
{*Eminem harmonizes the beat*}
Haha, I'm just playing, America
You know I love you

[Repeat 5X]
Maybe it's the thug in me
[2Pac]
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin drugs
And runnin from the narcs when they pass by, don't ask why
I'm a hustler, till my ass die
Even if I do come up, I'll be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all
Fuckin with them tramp-ass sluts you supposed to fall
Said she played you for your money but the shit was cool
Guess it's true, niggas be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you, all up in the skirt
Now you lookin like a jerk cause she hurt you
Now head's up, don't be a playa hater, just peep game
Keep your mind on your money watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker 'fore I shoot - who do you love?
[Hook: repeat 2X except last line second time]
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Tell me who do you love?
Maybe it's the thug in me, maybe it's the thug in me
Who do you love?
[2Pac]
I'm livin that, thug life bay-bee!
Steady smokin indo, goin cra-zy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me, turn the lights down
We in the dark, do you love me?
Everybody's talkin 'bout they, KNOW ME
But they ain't down like my motherfuckin homies
Tell me what you need when you, SEE ME
And we can get it on, BEOTCH, take it ea-sy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number baby call me when you lone-ly
Cause it's a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
I'm high 'til I die, and strapped with my fo'-five
Cause you can lose it in the gutter
I wonder if I'll die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer, I'm all in
Thug for life nigga ballin
I'm gettin tired of these hoes tryin to play me
You can't fade me and my niggas goin crazy
All day long I'm straight thuggin, and constantly mean muggin
Breakin the bitches that be buggin tell me who do you love?
[Hook - this time with the last line the second time]

[Intro]
(I never knew I) Mic check one-two
(I never knew I) Who would have knew
(I never knew I) Who woulda known
(I never knew I) Fuck woulda thought
(I never knew I) Mothafucka comes out
(I never knew I) And sells a couple of million records
(I never knew I) And these mothafuckas hit the ceiling
[Verse 1]
I don't do black music, I don't do White music
I make fight music, for high school kids
I put lives at risk when I drive like this
I put wives at risk with a knife like this
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out
Ducked the fuck way down, waiting to straight jump out
Put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now
Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?
Take my fucking eyeballs out and turn them around
Look, I'll burn your fucking house down, circle around
And hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burnin' furniture out (Oh my God! Oh my God!)
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor
Quit tryna censor music, this is for your kid's amusement, the kids
But don't blame me when little Eric jumps off of the terrace
You shoulda been watching him, apparently you ain't parents
[Hook]
Cause I never knew I, knew I would get this big
I never knew I, knew I'd affect this kid
I never knew I'd, get him to slit his wrist
I never knew I'd, get him to hit this bitch
[Verse 2]
So who's bringing the guns in this country
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London
And last week, I seen this Schwarzenegger movie
Where he's shooting all sorts of these mothafuckas with an uzi
I sees three little kids, up in the front row
Screaming go, with their 17-year-old Uncle
I'm like, guidance...
 
ain't they got the same moms and dads
Who got mad when I asked if they liked violence
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear
What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear
So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words
When his bus driver's screaming at him, fucking him up worse
(Go sit the fuck down, you little fucking prick)
And fuck was the first word I ever learned
Up in the third grade, flipping the gym teacher the bird, look
So read up 'bout how I used to get beat up
Peed on, be on free lunch and changed school every 3 months
My life's like kinda what my wife's like, what
Fucked up after I beat her fucking ass every night, Ike
So how much easier would life be
If 19 million mothafuckas grew to be just like me
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I never knew I..
 
knew I'd have a new house or a new car
A couple years ago I was more poorer than you are
I don't got that bad of a mouth, do I
Fuck shit ass bitch cunt,
 
shooby-de-doo-wop, what
Skibbedy-be-bop,
 
a Christopher Reeve
Sonny Bono, skis, horses and hitting some trees
How many retards'll listen to me
And run up in the school shooting when they're pissed at a tea-
-cher,
 
her, him is it you is it them
Wasn't me, Slim Shady said to do it again
Damn, how much damage can you do with a pen
Man, I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been
If you woulda been in my shoes,
 
who woulda thought
Slim Shady would be something that you woulda bought
That woulda made you get a gun and shoot at a cop
I just said it, I ain't know if you'd do it or not
[Hook]
[Outro]
How the fuck was I supposed to know

This songs for all the idiots to listen to
,
That includes you Nariah Fernandez
And your boyfriend to
,
Shit, both of yall can get it
Fucking bitches
,
Find me and fight me
If you got a problem with it
Come and fix it
What, its wrong for me to cuss in my songs
But its ok for Justin Bieber to smoke all the weed that he wants
,
I don;t know what the fucks going on
But drugs are turning these celebrities
Into fucking Lindsay Lohan
And drugs are everywhere these days now
,
I was selling crack, with a discount, yesterday down at the playground
,
That's why these kids think i'm awesome
, 
but their parents listen to my music, and always claim, that i'm awful,
 
But who care about their parents are saying, I don't think about stuff like that, every time that i'm singing,
 
cause nobody care these days, cops sit back, and let Justin Bieber respray the whole place
, and speaking of cops, I got pulled over by two, for running a stop sign, cause nobody tells me what to do

[Intro: Trick-Trick & Eminem]
Yeah, we back baby!
(Yea, let's go!)
I told y'all I was coming back
(We done time !)
Detroit, what bitch?
It's Trick-Trick !
(Yeah !)
And motherfuckin Slim Shady ! (Hahahahahaaa!)
(What?)
Gettin back yo!
Get your motherfuckin' hands up!
[Verse 1: Trick-Trick]
We've been accused of everything
From chest wets, to death threats
The best yet, and niggas gettin' their neck check
Best check to protect
Detroit is only known know
For the best threats
So bet, we got decks and techs
Collect debt
And rest the goon squad
We reck your whole set
We rep the Mid-West
You reppin niggas get wrong
Speak on your songy songs
Sendin' them home
Stone sprone
And broken bones
Better leave us the fuck alone
Keep it runnin' thru niggas
Can't even stomach what
The D got comin'
Waitin' until they frontin' and poppin' off at the Chopper Boyz
We poppin off shots
Guaranteeing a spot at the top
First place for niggas gettin guys who think you fuckin with Trick and Eminem
No you not motherfucker
So next time you see us
Be sure that you make a hole
And when they mention the D
Get down on all fours
[Hook: Trick-Trick]
Got big killas with big guns (Who want it?)
Come to my hood
Get some (Who want it?)
Wanna start shit in the club boy (Who want it?)
Touched up (Who want it?)
Fucked up (Who want it?) (x2)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Ooh wow, look at the bitches up in this club
Man im gettin me some digits fo I leave up out this mug
And it's like boom pow, 
wam, bam, thank you ma'am
I ain't kissin you on the lips, but ill be glad to shake your hand
Now let's get blew out, lets start some shit tonight
Just let me pick the chick that I'mma leave here with tonight
Before we get the fighting, and threw out
This music makes me rowdy, how they gonna play that new trick trick
And expect no-one to get their shit split
It's just too wild, and one more shot of hypnotic
And I am not in control of my body,
 I go robotic and blow a fuse out
Homies is like you're startin to stagger
And I'm nah that's just my swagger
 
but I'm dancing with this fat girl
And gettin loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partying
Til' this idiot dumps his bacardi on my cardigan
 
and knocks my screws out
It never fails, I'm know I'm going to jail
I might as well take the laces out my shoes now
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Trick-Trick]
I hear them screamin'
God damn it
There goes the Eminem in 'em !
There ain't no hittin' him
That think that we just cranked up
But he been with them
It's Trick and them
Goon squad gangstas
You can't get to him
We down for the bang and the brawl
But now we killin' him
See ever since we started
You might of had to pardon our hardest
From the largest city
They sayin that we retarded
And charges brought us over
They should just stop
Some of their artists got dropped
You think im playin
Then bring it
Come on lets see what you got
We make the club go bang *Gun shot*
You got that light noise
See ain't nobody fucking with this nigga and this white boy
That been through the realest and the pros
Treated their best like hoes
We put the thugs on
And make him beat it out of them clothes
We don't give a fuck about nothing you used to do
Your record is equalient to high scool musical
No blaming Jimmy Iovine, Paul or Dre
Blame me for everything I say
Cause I got him nigga
[Hook]
[Outro]
No damn body (Hell no !)
Fuckin' around, cuttin these niggas heads off

I 
AM SO SICK OF YOU MOTHERFUCKING EMINEM STANS ALL YOU DO IS SIT THERE LISTEN TO A BITCH AND HIS COCK AT LIVE SHOWS. OK TBH I CRINGE WHEN I SEE YOU LITTLE SHITS. TYGA WIZ KHALIFA DRAKE AND LIL WAYNE LEAD THE RAP GAME, And back in the day 2Pac and BIGGIE WERE THE ABSOLUTE SHIT BUT I WILL ADMIT I LOVED HIS FIRST ALBUM RECOVERY . LOVE THE WAY YOU LIE, NOT AFRAID, BEZERK, RAP GOD, AND THE MONSTER ARE THE THE BEST SONGS ON RECOVERY BUT I DO THINK HE IS ONE OF THE BEST BECAUSE OF HOW FAST HE RAPS. I CANT WAIT TILL HIS NEW ALBUM GUTS OVER FEAR COMES OUT. OKAY i"VE STATED MY STATEMENT I AM GOING TO LISTEN TO MY NIGGA TYGA ON RACK CITY

Eminem:
... grab the mic and I am kickin 'em
While I'm getting wicked with the wicked shit
About to be kicking it with ridiculous skits
When I be flipping 'em
Taking mic's and ripping them
When I come equipped to grab
And I stab shit
I stab motherfuckers bad
They go back to the lab
It's like a crack to the crab
Or crack to the crack
It doesn't matter, cause I'm kicking mad data
It doesn't matter who's fatter
Cause if I had a gun, then I would add a whole to your bladder
Kicking the mad fuckin' shit and I ?
Motherfuckers are scared of
In all kind of ways when I rewind blind ...

[Hook: X Ambassadors]
I'm getting by with my wicked ways
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder
Ever heard of Aspergers'? It's a rare condition
It's what you're suffering from
When you simply don't care if it's an
80 degree day and there's no fricken air conditioning
And you can't see the bitch’s hair is frizzing
Cause you got the windows up
Blaring the system in your
 
Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
And imagine him giving an adjective an ass whooping
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did something to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap,
 
I'm the shit, faggot (sniff it)
Cadillac from a K Car
My ass from a hole in the ground,
 
still can’t tell em a-part
Came straight out the trailer park screaming I'm proud
To shop at K-Mart and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I, still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart arguing over the same cart
In the middle of the aisle whilin'
I don't give a fuck I don't play!
Bitch you think you saw this basket first?
You're ass backwards like motherfucking Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Mind's like a pile of clay
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape
Ripped a gaping hole in it
Flipped out, ripped down the drapes
Tied 'em around my neck
Went down the fire escape of the Empire State
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
And straight to hell, got impaled by the gates
Saw Satan, stuck his face in an ashtray
While I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothing to do with a scale or being gay little faggot
But by the way,
 
thoughts are getting darker by the day
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face I'm insane
Every rhyme I say, sons you like an ultra violet ray
I’m selling hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99 so come on and pile a plate
I’m throwin' down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise
With the rhyme I’m spittin' while I’m shittin' on competition
In the meantime it’s always mean time
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I’ve been a career asshole
I don’t see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit, I was born a mistake
But I was put here not by accident
I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish
Slaughter tracks, I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I’m coming to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book
But I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'mma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid
Indigestion, my suggestion’s Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm running away with the game
It's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
Lady you can suck a dick til your neck aches
Cry til you get puffy eyes, red faced
But I'm leaving on this jet plane
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of pounding a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space
Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs
I keep on falling down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
If you felt these migraines and see these maggots eat my brain
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
If you read my mind, you can see my pain
And you'd see why I be this way
Ever since I was knee high playin' with G.I. Joes
Told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game
Cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
Like a (like a) fucking (fucking)
Echo (echo)
... 
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle
Spiraling,
 
here I go, I`m outta control like no
Other mic go,
 
stab you til' the knife goes - dull
I'm nothing but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
Coz I'mma sock it to you
Dyke ho, you don't like it
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night so
Strike up the fucking maestro,
 
I'm nitro
And hi ho, hand me my shovel,
 
I'm liable to dig my hole
Deeper,
 
and it's off to H.E double hockey sticks I go
[Hook]
"Ken Kaniff" (skit)
Outro: Eminem & Ken Kaniff
Ohh please be empty, please be empty, please be empty
Thank you, God
*bathroom door opening, someone walks in*
Shit...
*sounds of pissing and crapping*
Is that a girl?
*Ken Kaniff singing*
I'm gonna rock this blouse and put a cock in my mouth
And get my balls blew out, and get gay into the A.M
And lay with 18 guys naked and let myself show, let myself show
(Why do I know that voice?)
Buttfuck it, suck it, pull it, tug it
Life's too short to not stroke your bone
(Are you fucking serious?)
So everybody, everybody
Circle jerk, touch my body
*doors slam, screaming*
Who is that? Where are you going? Come back
Why does everyone always leave me?
Hello? Fuck you then
*loud crapping noise*
Blow it out your ass

[Intro]
Obie Trice! Real name, no gimmicks - (*record scratch*)
Two trailer park girls go round the outside
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back,
 
tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
[Verse 1]
I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (hey!!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits; fuck you, Debbie!
[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
[Verse 2]
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
Til someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH!!!
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {
}
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me?
Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna
Enter in,
 
and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention,
 
back for the winter
I'm interesting,
 
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
A-tisket a-tasket,
 
I go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking this shit, that shit
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over,
 
nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just gimme the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And used it to get myself wealthy
(Hey!!) 
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me
[Hook]
[Outro]
Kids!

[Intro]
Two ratchet little girls go round the outside
Two ratchet little girls go round the outside
Guess who's back... Back again... Rion's back... Tell a friend
Guess who's back... Guess who's back...
[Verse 1]
I've created a monster, but I disposed of the brain in trashcan, so, my man, what an odd stir
Of events in the last December, dated a cute girl, but I said, screw gifts, and didn't have any to send her
What a d-bag I am, so please remember who you're messin' with or talkin' to, 
mi amigo, comprender
?
My life has enough footage to render forever
, but frankly, my life is too darn good to even end here
And I... 
Got enough hops to offend beer
, 
so all the courts will be so empty without me near
!
Just listen to all screamin' without me here... Hear the silence? Without me, there is no fear!
If I scare ya'll on a daily basis, imagine how I am with Halloween faces, 
gettin' sprayed by ladies in Macy's
With large cans of maces
, call security, now looky here, there are no traces
Of a 
trash talking
, 
flash walkin'
, 
Kate and Ash stalkin'
 
weird occurrence of unnecessary
Without me, the world feels so empty, so why don't I fill it up usin' a bag of 
Hefty
Now get up, and dance to this beat
, but only 
try and use your left feet
[Hook]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty, without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
Cause we need a little, controversy
Cause it feels so empty without me
[Verse 2]
Reincarnation of the batman, but I like kitties, so call me catman, either way, I'm black with cats, so you can call me that man, anything but fat man fits, and if that hand fits in the mitts, matter fact my mitts, don't wear it
Only I can rock it like I do, cause I blast off, you bunch of dry fruits, never got along with y'all dudes
Never ballin' on the court, yanno, uh, kinda like mall foods
Lemme... sit back and spit stupid similes in my Black Cap, you Chickadees, my songs are remedies
Chillin' in the back over the rim of these-
*Gasp* Stop! It ain't hammer time, but ya'll know the drill, non-killin' villain
But I'm chillin' in the back like a pill and, never used the word "trillen" cause I'm crackin' uncrackable unsellable syllables
Then again sellin'em silly unwitting fitting things... If that makes sense, I jotted'em down without thinkin' anything
Because for me, thinking is messy, I act before thinkin', I pass before testing, I'm "enter resting", I nap before attending, I'm not saving you, I'm just infesting, yeah

I've summoned a monster!
Cuz nobody wants to see Yugi no more
They want Yami,
 I'm chopped liver!
Well if you want Yami this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of yaoi fanart of Yami Bakura
Some card games that drag on and on duller
Than the crap on those poor saps' TeamFourStar's channel
Or the gasps in their fanbase when they lose a rating
Or the gaps in their schedule when they're not updating! (HEY!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
Cause I'm back, it's time to duel, and cards need trading
You may think the dubs are mistranslating
But the guys who fansub are masturbating
So 4KidsTV won't let me be
Or let me be me
So let me see
They tried to switch me out with Dragonball Z
But it feels so empty without me so
Yu-Gi-Oh Abridged burned like a bridge
Got banned, you worried a smidge and raided the fridge
But don't panic, cause this s**t's about to get manic
I just shuffled all my trading cards, 
F*** YOU MARIK!
[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me

LittleKuriboh; the guy who watches Yu-Gi-Oh
Embarrassed his parents don't listen to Devo
He starts crying at Finding Nemo
Then he makes a lameo video and everyone yells WHOA!
A visionary, his fangirls are scary
A YouTube revolution, otakus are wary
A rebel,
 
so lemme just revel and boast
In the fact that I got everyone stealing my jokes
And it's a low-blow, such a cacophony
For you to steal so damn much from my show, don't copy me!
Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
We got screwed by Revver, blew the budget now we're gonna
Begin again, start from scratch and completely
Regain all our subscribers, update the show weekly
No protesting, just like you're all requesting
With all the quotes HeavyDDR's detesting
(Testing! Attention Duelists!)
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Lanipator claims I have animosity
You know what I think? "Who the hell is he?!"
[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me

I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody just follow me
Cause we need a little controversy

[VERSE 3:]
Abridge this Abridge that, it's become the new fad
It's a shame that most of the results turn out so bad
Yo Sephirex, quit makin' fun of GX
It's better than most of your video train wrecks
And Kaiser, man, you're none the wiser
Your series is about as funny as Rob schneider
Vegeta and Masako, you guys should just let go, it's over
Nobody watches Naruto
Now farewell
Go abridge some Zatch Bell!
Or post on your blog while listening to Soft Cell
This show's been greater than Ghost In The Shell
Ever since CurtDogg turned it into a nutshell
But sometimes it's all the same
Everybody only wants to call us lame
So this must mean LK's to blame
Cause it's not me, I'm king of games
And while he's not the first one to fandub Yugi
He is the first one that's not a newbie
To make the show seem kinda funny
Though it doesn't make him any money
(HEY!)
There's a concept that's broke!
Twenty million other users steal his jokes
But no matter how many imitate LK
It won't change the fact that he's here to stay
[HOOK]
Now this looks like a job for me

Cards!

[Produced by Rahki and DJ Khalil]
[Hook: Pink]
You can sound the alarm
You can call out your guards
You can fence in your yard
You can hold all the cards
But I won't back down
Oh no I won't back down, oh no
[Verse 1]
Cadillac Sevilles, coupe DeVilles, brain-dead rims, yeah, stupid wheels
Girl I'm too for real, 
lose your tooth-and-nail
Tryna fight it, try to deny it, stupid you will feel
What I do, I do at will, 
shooting from the hip, yeah boy, I shoot to kill
Half a breath left on my death-bed, screaming “F that”, yeah, super-ill
Baby what the deal? We can chill, split a half a pill and a Happy Meal
Fuck a steak slut, I'll cut my toes off and step on the receipt
Before I foot the bill
, 
listen garden tool
Don't make me introduce you to my power tool: You know the fucking drill
How you douchebags feel, knowing you're disposable?
Summer's Eve, Massengill
, 
Shady's got the mass appeal
Baby crank the shit cause it's your goddamn jam
You said that you want your punchlines a little more compact
Well shorty, I'm that man
These other cats ain't metaphorically where I'm at man
I gave Bruce Wayne a Valium and said: “Settle your fucking ass down
I'm ready for combat, man” Get it? Calm Batman, nah
Ain't nobody who's as bomb and as nuts
Lines are like Mom's CAT-scans cause they fucking go bananas
Honey I applaud that ass, swear to God, man, these broads can't dance
Ma, show them how it's done, spaz like a goddamn Taz, yea
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Girl shake that ass like a donkey with Parkinson's
Make like Michael J. Fox is in your drawers, playing with an etch-a-sketch
Bet you that you'll never guess who's knocking at your door
People hit the floors, yeah tonight ladies you gonna get divorced
Girl, forget remorse, I'mma hit you broads with Chris' force
Like you pissed him off
, 
talented with the tongue motherfucker
You ain't got a lick in yours
 
hitting licks
Like I'm robbing liquor stores, making cash registers shit their drawers
Think you spit the rawest? I'm an uncooked slab of beef
Laying on your kitchen floor, in other words I'm off the meat rack
Bring the beat back,
 
bring in two extension cords
I'mma measure my dick, shit I need 6 inches more
Fuck my dick's big
, 
bitch need I remind you
That I don't need the fucking swine flu to be a sick pig?
You're addicted I'm dope, I'm the longest needle around here
Need a fix, ock?
 
I'm the big shot, get it, dick-snots?
You're just small pokes, little pricks
Girl you think that other prick's hot, I'll drink gasoline and eat a lit match
Before I sit back and let him get hotter,
 better call the cops on him quick, fast
Shady's right back on your bitch-ass
, 
white trash with a half a 6-pack
In his hatchback trailer hitch attached to the back,
 
dispatch
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Bitch am I the reason that your boyfriend stopped rapping?
Does a bird chirp?
 
Does Lil' Wayne slurp syrup until he burps
And smoke purp?
 
Does a word search get circles wrapped around it
Like you do when I come through?
 
I'd like you to remind yourself
Of what the fuck I can do when I'm on the mic
Oh, you're the kind of girl that I could take a liking to
Psych!
 
I'm spiking you like a football
Been this way since I stood a foot tall
You're a good catch with a shitty spouse, got a pretty mouth and a good jaw
Give me good brain, watch the wood-grain
Don't want no cum stain..bitch, you listening?
Trying to turn me down, slut I'm talking to you, turn me back up
Are you insane?
 
Trying to talk over me in the car
Shut the fuck up while my shit's playing
I'm a shit stain on the underwear of life,
 
what's the saying?
Where there's thunder there's lightning and they say that it
Never strikes twice in the same place so how the fuck have
I been hit 6 times in 3 different locations on 4 separate occasions
And you can bet your stanking ass that I've come to smash
Everything in my path
, 
fork was in the road, took the psycho path
Poison Ivy wouldn't have me thinking rash
So hit the dancefloor cutie while I do 
my duty
 on this microphone
Shake your booty
, shorty, 
I'm the shit
Why you think Proof used to call me Doodie?

[Hook: Eminem]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
[Verse One: Tha Clip]
I'll try not to be gone for too long but while I am don't miss me
Too much because the thought of such love and sorrow will only piss me
Off,
 I might just mess my self up with putting alcohol in my mouth
I'll breathe flames with the fire I spit then go south
Like my life
Without you here, Dear, I fear that I'm not right
To try to make a career to reach a musical height
But it's nothing having this, without someone to share it with
Like Drake and Nicki getting married it's just a myth
Cause it's not real
The music sposed to be something you feel
But most of us artists turn right around like a steering wheel
Don't play games, just live life, cause it's not long
You could die in the blink of an eye before the end of this song
You never know when it will end
You won't be able to defend
You never know when time will stop and not have any raps to send
You won't know when you go
I need you by my side, so
I can show you what I have wanted to show
And that is..
[Repeat hook]

[Hook x2]
My words are weapons
I use 'em to crush my opponents
My words are weapons
I never show no emotion
My words are weapons
I use 'em to kill whoever's stepping to me
My words are like weaponry on a record
[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo, the rage I release on a page
Is like a demon unleashed in a cage
Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage
My mind is like a fucking stick of dynamite
Once I get behind the mic
It's like the wick is lit, you bitches die tonight
My nine is like a guiding light at night, shining bright
My fucking grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych
These cock sucking cops got my Smith-N-Wesson
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon
Man, the shit's depressing
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present
(Come on, Slim, let's go and teach this fucking bitch a lesson)
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage
Shady stay creative, baby, hold your head up, don't you let up
One bit on these motherfucking suckers you're a soldier get up
Stand up for what you believe in, 
long as you breathing
They jealous of you, man, that's the only reason they beefing
[Hook x2]
[Verse 2: Swifty McVay]
It's that Dirty Dozen renegade
You done pulled the pin out my grenade
38s'll move your shit up out the way
You niggas won't forget about McVay, you got something to say?
Let it out today or watch these bullets spray
From these ten black fingers hugging these deadly millimeters
That'll make Jeff Dahmer's look like he caught a misdemeanor
See I'm 'Dirty', so I ain't gotta buy a pistol cleaner
An official beater, don't let me see you with yo' heater
You gets whipped with it, tell them motherfuckers Swift did it
You packing something special in your crib, then bitch, get it
I'm physically fitted to run yo' digits, I'm hostile
(Uh huh)
With this Roscoe pointed up your nostrils
You get splitted and guess what? I'm blowing up the hospital
And wouldn't give a fuck if you a cop or a ho
I'm Hannibal Lector, the spinal cord disconnector
Finding whores to lock 'em up in motels to inject 'em
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3: Bizzare]
I'm eating crews like I'm Hannibal
There's no way I can be the gay rapper
(Why not?)
I only fuck animals
(Oh, haha)
Stupid trick got my dick starting to itch
Went to my mother's grave site, called her a stupid bitch
One on one in this bloodsport
I'm in divorce court, sold my bitch off a pack of Newports
(Your honor)
Six times I been arrested, how would you feel?
If you was a Jehovah witness that always got molested?
(It happens)
I'm smoking dank, drinking, drank
I can't have any kids cause I'm fucking shooting blanks
Don't you know Bizarre don't give a fuck?
Nicole's a whore, 
I'm glad O.J. murdered the slut
(Uhh)
Responsibility, I'm negligent
Bill Clinton's a 
fag
, should be stabbed
Let Richard Simmons be the President
(Ohh, hey)
Call me a weirdo, call me Bi-zarre
While I stick it up yo' ass while you shitting diarrhea
[Hook x2]

Zane Lowe: 
Welcome back to Radio One, Maida Vale studio 4 here we are.
 Part of the reason we're here obviously because its the BBC but also because we have Studio 3 around the corner and you've got the band set up and 
going to perform some songs
 as well.
Eminem: It's super exciting to be here. 
I was trying to figure out how I was going to top the publicity of yours and Kanye's interview
 
so I decided I was going to walk in here, pee on the floor, and leave. I'm peeing right now. Alright see you guys later!
ZL: 
Seeing you with the band, and seeing you perform the other night at the awards show and seeing you on the mic, it was, I don't think I've ever seen you more alive on the mic.
 It was full of energy and in the moment. What I noticed was as well was spitting live with the band behind you seemed to free you up a lot more. Are you feeling that way?
E: 
I think performing has gotten a lot different, it's gotten better with the band because there's just more elements to it and being it is a live show, there's more places you can go with it. There's things you can do with your hands, it's really cool, it's different. I think it's better.
ZL: 
Spitting Rap God that just puts everything into perspective I think for everybody else. When you wrote that and you got that one down and recorded it...
E: 
I didn't write that, I freestyled it, off the dome, 1 take.
ZL: 
Absolutely ridiculous. I mean, the song is ridiculous it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
E: 
Thank you
ZL: 
When you get to perform that live that must be, I saw at the end once you finished that, that's a challenge for anybody. At the end you must feel like 'Wow'. That's a lot of rhymes to get through, it's like 5 or 6 minutes non-stop.
E: 
Um, Yeah the other night I don't think we did the whole song. We did kind of a Deadly Medley.
ZL: 
I don't even know how you would cut that up and make a shorter version of that because it's such a stream of consciousness through the whole track.
E: 
Yeah I don't know. I wouldn't even want to begin to think of that, because I think it is a... stream of consciousness. Nice stream of consciousness, running down my leg.
ZL: 
The album itself has been so well received by everyone including fans across the world. Because in my opinion listening to it now it's kinda the perfect combination of the venom and the danger that existed on the 1st record but also what you've been through and what you've learnt over the past 5 or 6 years. It's kind of like the combination of the two. Is that fair do you think? The first album that feels like it's slightly grown up, but also going back to some of those subject matters and dealing with that stuff.
E: 
It's grown up and down. I mean some of the themes and topics and things like that are revisited on this album, but at the same time I feel like its kind of a 2013 version. All my albums I think, for the most part, pretty much tell where I'm at, you know at each one at that time period, whatever. So this is kinda like, there's a lot of reflecting and things like that back on everything that was happening during that time, you know. And it's kinda like me reflecting on it and getting to the point where I am now with it.
ZL: 
Settling some scores as well, and burying the hatchets and dealing with stuff once and for all. Do you feel like this album has allowed you to do that?
E: 
I mean some stuff, yeah.
 But for the most part I just felt like it might be fun to just revisit that, the overall vibe of that album. Just because it started to go there in the recording process.
ZL: So when did that begin like you were going down that road?
E: I had started making a few records for it, and it just sounded like the tonality of it, the tones of the records kinda were heading towards that way. And I figured out what direction it should go in, kinda started gearing everything that way. And alotta times, making an album, I dont always have the direction or concept early on. Sometimes it doesn't come until the middle/towards the end of a record to figure out where I'm actually going with that... that's just a culmination of songs, and depending on what the vibe is. Sometimes I do a songs that is so left field one or two of them its like 
 where am I going to put these songs and now what am I going to call it because its not going to make sense to go, let's say Recovery or whatever. But with this one I feel like I kinda got an earlier idea for a concept.
ZL: That must be nice actually to be able to sit down and carve it out as it was going and have that end result in mind, to piece it together that way.
E: It was, but it wasn't, in the sense of-- I had to record a lot of songs for it because I felt like if I'm going to call it that, I want it to make sense.
ZL: And the stakes are high as well. I was talking to someone about this before and they were saying, "Eminem would never consider one of his albums to be a classic" he's not that way inclined. But you know how people feel about the Marshall Mathers LP, it speaks volumes. And then the critics, every layer of it, it is considered a modern day classic album. Did you consider the expectation of calling it that and what it would mean to the record overall?
E: Yeah, I had kinda known that going in. Once I kinda knew what direction I was going, I knew that I needed certain songs to be able to call it that, and like I said to be able to make sense. But, I just wanted to make sure that I had the right ones, and in other words, I knew that, obviously Stan off the first Mathers LP was a big topic. And I had heard a lot of chatter around the time doing the Recovery record that I should do Stan 2 and why doesn't he do Stan 2, and all I kept thinking was Stan's dead. You know what I'm saying, he died in the story. So in the back of my mind I kinda had an idea of who could be left from the story, but I needed to get the right beat and be able to...
[plays song]
ZL: As soon as it starts as well. Did you know immediately this would be the beat for this concept?
E: 
Yeah, as soon as I heard the words to the chorus... I got this beat, this beat was sent to me and had those words on it. And sometimes for me it's like- I like making my own choruses and its also fun for me to take someone else's words and interpret them my own way.
ZL: For sure, when you hear that chorus I'm sure initially... it's a 1st person scenario or self hatred scenario, but its tied into- there's layers to that. Being bad is good I hate to be it but here I am and I'm back again. And then you got to deal with the story, and at the end it's taking everyone to the end when you couldn't be facing down any more of the criticism both self and by others that you faced throughout your career. I mean it's the ultimate type of acknowledgement isn't it?
Meeting your maker almost really, is that the inspiration behind it?
E: It's kinda like saying, if you're going to go down this road, then you're going to call it this, and this is going to be the title, and this is all of these things coming back on me.
ZL: It's an amazing opening to the record and it's really ambitious as well. So you set the bar really really high and from here we go to Rhyme or Reason, and I love that beat and love the big samples and first time you reference Rick Rubin as a producer on the record. When did you first have the idea of working with Rick?
E: I've always been a fan of Rick's, and my manager Paul had been talking to him and Rick had expressed that he had interest in working with me. And when Paul brought it to my attention I was like super excited, honored at the fact that he was even thinking about it. I had my reservations just because I felt like I'm a super fan of Rick, and I'd probably be a little nervous and wouldn't know what the vibe would be because I would be wanting to impress him. It was very much the feeling that I got early on with Dre.
ZL: Had you met Rick before?
E: Nah, I'd never met him. So I was like nervous to meet him and you know, even more nervous to work with him.
ZL: 
Same thing with Dre, all the way back, same kind of experience when you walked in the studio and saw Dre that time..
E: Yeah I'm still always trying to impress Dre too to this day at the same time. But I just kept thinking if I got in the studio with Rick, what if we're not able to come up with anything. I had all these things in my head, and then when I met him, the guy's so laid back, it made it easy. And his vibe in the studio is very much like... "Try whatever", don't be afraid to try whatever, even if the idea in the beginning is stupid. Because a lot of ideas in the beginning stages, not mine of course, mine are just insane from the moment I think of them- but sometimes ideas are not always the greatest.[Snippet from "Brainless"]
"Who can say for sure? Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer
If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use
Society will reap a great benefit."
[Zane Lowe]
Let's talk about your work on the record as a producer, 
because I know on Relapse you did nothing
, on 
Recovery
 you got back into it, I've always said to you as long as I've know you or you've been making beats how much of a fan I am of your particular music, 
your production for others
 as well as just for yourself.
[Eminem]
Oh, thank you.
[Zane Lowe]
And so to hear you back making beats again on some of the standout beats on the record was a real thrill.
 
So, I mean, how was that getting back into the producer's chair and deciding to wear two hats again?
[Eminem]
Urm, I mean that was fun, it was fun to, to be able to, just mess around with beats from scratch again and, you know, sometimes, like, I think Recovery was the first time that I ever got really super-open to, urr, working with a lot of other producers, you know that was the most I had ever done, and, you know, aside from working with Dre. You know, so, on that album kind of opened those doors a little bit, so that's kinda how early on, we started approaching this record, or this album, and sometimes, like I may get something in my head like an idea or the mood of something that I would want and I'm not always gonna get that by going through, you know, different tracks if other people have made, they don't know what's in my head, you know what I'm saying, so it's also a good way to, ur, I think maybe it helps with diversity a little bit too, with the sound and all that, you know, I would get something in my head and wanna be able to lay that idea down from scratch.
[Zane Lowe]
It just sounds like your being inspired by rap, in a big big way, I mean...
[Eminem]
Absolutely
[Zane Lowe]
I mean, I know you've always been that way, we've known each other for a long time and I've met you at various points throughout every album and I know that it's...
[Eminem]
I just met you, out there I thought... It's all good man, I'm still peeling the floors. (Laughter)
[Zane Lowe]
Um, you know and the music reflects your head space, it's always been pretty honest, not just lyrically but also musically I mean there was a time when the beats you were making were all very kind of minor key and lots of strings and lots of, kind of, a lot of Drama. The beats on here are fun. I mean, they're fat, big and rap! Like inspired by hip-hop!
[Eminem]
Yeah, I mean, it's pretty much all I do, and all I wanna do, you know what I'm saying like, so it's fun for me, like I'm still, you know, like I'm still passionate about hip-hop, and every aspect of it, so, making beats and producing, you know, is definitely, it's fun for me.
[Zane Lowe]
What is it about rap that you love? I mean I'm a huge, I mean I grew up on hip-hop and it forms pretty much every sort of thing I've ever done in my life pretty much to some form, and what I wondered, you know, being someone who is considered one of the greatest of all time, what is it about rap the art form, if you can even trace it back to when you first discovered it, to how you feel about it now and what are your most rap-heavy records?
[Eminem]
You know, just a lot of rap.
[Zane Lowe]
A lot of rapping on there, a lot of words?
[Eminem]
Yeah
[Zane Lowe]
What is it about it that you love, if you can put it into words?
[Eminem]
Hmm, I dunno, I, urm, I love the fact that you can, I love the expression of it. The fact that you can, you know, just, I don't know, I love the, I love beats and rhymes and I love the fact that you can express yourself in a rhyme and lay it down and 
it can be therapeutic, and you've got it off your chest
, and then you could go on to the next thing, I don't know, there's so much shit that I love about rap, you know, I'm in it for like, I love to watch what's going on in the game and keep my finger on the pulse of that, you know, and it's exciting to watch as a fan, for me too, you know, just being a fan of hip-hop, urm, and watching as it, you know, the evolution of it, and, you know, how it moves from each year to year, you know what I'm saying, the direction, and...
[Zane Lowe]
Are you sort of relieved that you can be that now, you can be a contender for the world's greatest rapper along with a selection of your peers and it can be a really amazing rap record and to a certain extent, I hope you take this the right  way because I know your strong career, very popular, number 1 in 80+ countries, huge, but the pop stars kind of did, you know, in the sense of what people expect from you these days, isn't it, you don't have to be that guy any more, you can just be a rapper and make rap records if you want. Is that a relief?
[Eminem]
Well, yeah, I think so, urm, it's one of them things like, as far as like, being a pop star or whatever like, I never, never intended to be any of that, you know wha I'm saying, like, all I ever wanted to do was get respect from, you know, my peers       and other rappers, and, urm, all the other stuff that came with it was just, you know, confusing to me, it was, I don't know, like I don't feel like I ever set out to make a pop song or a song that was gonna be some kind of crossover song or whatever... is that for me?
[Zane Lowe]
Yeah, if you want it.
[Eminem]
Thanks man, appreciate it. Urm...
[Zane Lowe]
And then boom, you did! And it didn't stop for years!
[Eminem]
Well boom, it happened but at the same time, like - I never wanted to - when things did did keep happening and when certain things kept hitting the radio and things like that, I mean, I don't think I'm stupid. I'm not stupid. Like, I know when a song has a certain particular sound and sounds like "well maybe this could possibly be a radio record", or when I'm going "fuck, shit, ass!" you know what I'm saying, and I know "this will never go to radio". But at the same time, if a song starts heading that way, cause a lot of times I may even think, I may even think certain things when I'm writing it, like, maybe what person this might connect with, you know what I'm saying like, and who I might connect with with this song. But I never, in making any song I have made, I never wanted to compromise lyrical integrity, yeah, you know, and I always wanted to make sure that if I was rapping on a beat that had some kind of appeal to it and was catchy, that I was at least doing my job as an MC, and you know what I'm saying...
[Zane Lowe]
Oh that's the struggle!
[Eminem]
And doing what I feel like I need to do.
[Zane Lowe]
That's tough man, because you want to give as much quality as you possibly can through your music, you're not going to hold yourself back in case you get successful, but at the same time like you say it's never been on the agenda, and I guess in a way that was part of what caused the problem in the first place that just manifested over that time, huh, like, how do I do both? How do I be good and not court this, not be this guy that everybody expects something from?
[Eminem]
Yeah, urm, I know that early on I went through a lot of that with 
the "Hi, my name is" record
, and it was, urm, like I never understood, like I understood that the record was funny, and i understood that it was a little, urm, how you say, kitschy, or whatever, and maybe the hook was, the whole record was tongue-in-cheek. You know what I'm saying, like I'm still doing a lot of records like that to this day, with the tongue-in-cheek, but that record in particular was just like, it was my, it was almost like my anti-pop song cause it was like my hello to the world but it was my "fuck you" to the world at the same time. So I never understood, like, when all that started happening, like holy shit how did that become a, you know, I guess pop song.
[Zane Lowe]
So when did the penny drop and you realized the more you say "fuck you", the more people are gonna say, you know, "hi, we love you"?
[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean...
[Zane Lowe]
Probably around the Marshall Mathers LP right, cause that's when it really started to, to blow up again?
[Eminem]
Yeah, I think, I think there was a lot of that, and I think that just, coming from being an underground MC and being an underdog and things like that kinda gave me that attitude I think, you know, [Intro]
Better watch out now cause here we come
And we ain’t stoppin until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing, cause we ain’t come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now and grab someone
[Verse 1]
Man first of all, I’m a boss, I just wanna get that across
Man even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it’s a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows,
 
spray painted doors
With the flames on ‘em,
 
Michigan plates and my names on ‘em
Baby Shady’s here, come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain’t stupid so quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to cupid, why you tryna put your claims on him
Cause you won’t do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There’s a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just getting home, now can I get that lap dance?
She’s got a tattoo of me right above her ass man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan we call ‘em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me,
 
time to put the damn clamps
Down
 and show this hussie who’s man, now get amped, dance!
[Hook]
Now you can do this on your own, but everyone knows
That no one likes to be alone, so get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain’t nothing but a white trash party!
So let’s have us a little bash, and if anyone asks
It ain’t no one, but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
Cause we’re having a white trash party!
[Verse 2]
Pull a fifth of Bacardi from outta my underwear
And walk around the party without a care, like a body without a head
Looking like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow probably still be too high to get out of bed
Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixing Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I’m hollerin “Die santa”
Missed the tree and hit Rudolf and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stallin
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darling
Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly I start ballin
Making it rain for the ladies in the mini’s
But I’m not throwing ones, fives, tens or even twenties
I’m throwing quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies
Up at Skinny’s, man I do this for them bunnys up at Denny’s
From the north, east and west
But when it comes to them trailers in them south parks, muffle it
Cause homie, that hood’s tighter than Kenny’s
So ladies if your belly button’s not an innie, then I’m outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let’s get rowdy cmon!
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Now whether you’re black, white or 
purple
 if you’re misunderstood
But you 
don’t give a fuck
, you ain’t doing shit that you should
Long as you know you’re up to evil and you’re no damn good
Get on the floor mayne, and rep your hood
[Verse 3]
Now honey, don’t let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
Cause girl I got a sick whip, kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk, rip out the stick shift
And make a five seater
, 
I’ll be damned if I feed a
Chick, it ain’t like me to split a peice of dry pita
I’ll be the S-L to the I M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don’t need a tank top to be a wife beater
I’ll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
Before I turn over a new leaf, clown
, I’ll tell you now
I’m so raw I still need to unthaw
, you feel me y'all
I shut the club down, like Drake in the mall
But baby a body like that’s against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car, now get up!
[Hook]

Hand me an eighth, beam me up and land me in space
Imma sit on top of the world and spit on Brandy and Mase
I'm more than ill
Scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill
Human horror film
But with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me
Cause I'mma still be the Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot
I'll be in a canoe paddlin', makin fun of your yacht
But I would like an award
For the best rapper to get one mic in The Source
And a wardrobe I can afford
Otherwise I might just end up back striking at Ford
And you wonder what the hell I need more Vicodin for?
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank
Looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off
No wonder I'm a great danger to my health
Why else would I kill you then jump in a grave and bury myself?
Are you afraid of a blade made of a razor with AIDS
Blood dripping from it, ripping your stomach like a paper mâché
You talk a lotta junk but you was never ill though
I'm strong enough to beat you to death with a feather pillow
Tipped over some cows, just for a joke and a laugh
Jumped up, choked a giraffe, snapped his neck and broke it in half
Waging wars, went on stage and sprayed Cage with Agent Orange
And wiped my ass with his page in Source
The demon is here, steaming this year
I rip Mystikal's voice box out and scream in his ear
It's not a gimmick bitch; it's an image, I live it
Give a damn, I don't know what a damn is to give it
Yeah I don't think this guy is well, I'm high as hell
I'll beat you with a live cat when I'm swinging him by his tail
I'll freaking, I'll freaking, lay your nuts on the dresser
Just your nutsack by itself and bang them shits with a spiked bat
Cut your neck off and sew your head right back and leave you like that
You just triggered the prick who just mixed liquor
Who's itching to leave you disfigured
And stiffer than Chris-stiff-er Reeves
I was teething with strep throat, while your mother was breastfeeding
And gave her the flesh-eating disease
I'm iller than takin' a hammer and beating your knees
And walking through South Central L.A., bleeding in jeans
Flashing back to being shot and repeating the scenes
On how you just got smoked
And if you do live, you'll be too scared to tell it like a Biggie and Pac joke
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched outta his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinsky
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten speed
Screaming to Aunt Peg with three spokes sticking outta my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine, dammit I like pain
You should be anywhere that a mic ain't
You rap knowing you wack, you act up and I'm throwing you
Down a flight of steps then I'm throwing you back up them
If they don't like the track, f- them, the rap struck 'em harder
Than getting hit by a Mack truck and then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath, I'mma climb the Empire State Building
And get to the last step and still have half left

[Intro]
What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense but not to constitute what this country at times calls if or which over. We seem to be approaching an age of the gross. {burp} We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' station and each generation should do a little bit better
[Verse 1]
Alright come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started,
 
let's start addressing this issue and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape
And its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music that we all enjoy,
 
the music you accuse me of trying to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy on the east side of Detroit
Crossin 8 Mile
 
into Warren,
 
into hick territory
I'd like to share a story,
 
this is my story and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well-inform me, I am well aware that I don't belong here
You've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay there's a bright side: a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it hauling my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well-known tracks
[Hook]
Come on, let's go back
Follow the yellow brick road 
as we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through
 
this nifty little place
I once used to call home sweet home
[Verse 2]
I roam the streets so much they call me a drifter
Sometimes I stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to 8 Mile and Van Dyke
And steal a god damn bike from somebody's backyard
And drop it off at the park that was the halfway mark
To meet Kim
Had to walk back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
 
with Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osbourne
 
handing out some flyers, he was doin some talent shows
At Center Line High, I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head, like "white boys don't know how to rhyme"
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
With compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool till your man MC Shan came through
And said that Puma's the brand cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors but, man, god damn they flew
Must've been true because man we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J, Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw them in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next? X Clan debuted
Professor X (vanglorious), exists in a state of red, black, and green
With a key, sissies!
 
Now with this being a new trend
We don't fit in crackas is out with 
 albums
Blackness is in, African symbols and medallions
Represent black power and we ain't know what it meant
Me and my man Howard and Butta would go to the mall with 'em
All over our necks like we're showin 'em off
, 
not knowin at all
We was being laughed at, "you ain't even half black!
You ain't supposed to have that homie let me grab that"
And that Flavor Flav clock we goin' have to snatch that
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
Saying how we hate this, how racist but dope the X Clan tape is
Which reminds me
 
back in '89 me and Kim broke up for the first time
She was try'na two-time me,
 
and there was this black girl
At our school who thought I was cool
Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyeing me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even goin' say it, plus
The same color hair as hers was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest god damn girl in our whole school, if I could pull her
Not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time
But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her
But she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard or spoke
To the
 
"Oh Foolish Pride" girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was I singled out a whole race and for that apologize
I was wrong cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a ho
[Hook]

[Refrain: 50 Cent]
Who run it, you know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you know but you actin' like you don't know
Who run it, you know, you actin' like you don't know
We run it, you know but you actin' like you don't know
You know, you actin' like you don't know
I tear the club up fo' sho'
This flow is gon' bring mo dough
And you know but you acting like you don't know
[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Now homie, I say I "run it run it" cause I'm in control
Hpnotiq, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feeling aight, 
I get you high as a kite
Party popping shawty says she coming with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leaning, 
I ain't snappin' and poppin'
Either I'm bobbin' my head or I'm just standin' there watchin'
I'm a hustler, I hustle; you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga, you front, you gon' get it; OK, now maybe I said it
Cause I want you to trid-dip
, yeah I be on that shitty
You should see when I'm stunting, I flash the stones to be wanting
Push the whip, see me rolling, 
you can tell that I'm holding
I'm just doing my thang, you know the Unit's the game
I got my grimy Shady with me; you front
You gonna have to get me off your ass
I pay the lawsuit and laugh
It's not a big deal, it's nothing but some cash
[Refrain]
[Verse 2: Eminem]
When me and Fif' got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped, we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship
, 
me nemesis is su nemesis
Ain't for him, it's just media; see, to them, it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef, you just gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem, we solve it
, 
if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holding the most current beef on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs 'til it's over
But tonight, we ain't coming here to beef with nobody
We came to party
, 
Banks,
 
Cashis
 and 
Mr. Ferrari
So it's Shady, Aftermizath
, 
back in that ass,
 you 
wizzass
Come hizzon, what kinda fuzukin' quizition is that
[Refrain]
[Verse 3: Ca$his]
Pistol play, ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleedin', J.F.K
HK
 to your chest, plate cave
I ride to the death, do you rep that way
Forever I'mma be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumping in all beef
You keep talking shit now the squad called me
[Verse 4: Lloyd Banks]
Enough holding back the steam,
 
Em let off a magazine
Dappadon 
Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fucking G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walking bitch magnet
Spit it how I live it, live it
 
all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, 
you dig it?
[Refrain]
[Outro: Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Banks, Ca$his, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement; you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I'm keeping it raw
Illegal like Malik and Jamal
Cause I don't believe in the law
Like I'm Steven Seagal
Flipping off the police while I'm leaping the wall
Take some Tylenol then fall asleep in the mall
Got your little son, you'll be receiving a call
You're lucky this little punk's still breathing at all
Fuck the world, this is how I get even at y'all
Popped sick and rolled up, and leave in the vault
I'll hit you in the mouth and stick your teeth in the jaw
You won't be able to eat shit, not even a malt
Speak of assault
It's giving you a reason to stall
Cocking this dude's deuce and I'm squeezing it off
The first burp and a fart
Syphilis, sneeze, and a cough
Get your arm chewed off
Like you was teasing a dog
I'm cold enough and hot enough to freeze and then thaw
I kicked my girl out in ten degrees and a bra
You faggots turn yellow like the trees in the fall
Signal rap "Where's Shady?" He's in the stall
All that's left of your niece is a piece of her doll
And all that's left of her puppy is a leash and a paw
Motherfucker
[Hook]
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me
You must be crazy
If you want to fade me
[
Verse 2: Hot Karl
]
WUH-OHH! I bet Jimmy Iovine's scared
Hot Karl and Eminem, same song: nightmare
But let's break the rules and be a rebel instead
And jack unused lyrics from rappers who aren't even dead
Thank you Rectangle for these sixteen bars
With a track so sick you can use 'em as SARS
Too many rappers think they're 2Pac and they should stop
Unless it's him in Poetic Justice, workin' a post office
Then you quit rap dog, proving your pedigree
Is questionable, like Da Brat's femininity
I'm not a gangster, I'm just trying to live
And take you back to the days like Garbage Pail Kids
I'm playing the bigs, your whole game is sloppy
Only time you're rocking ciphers is when you get bukkake'd
Yeah, it's Hot Karl, I'm going for broke
I guess a hit is still a hit: sorry, Interscope!
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Dree]
And that's Whitman
That's Latrice Gibbons
Tighter with my flow than what most niggas is spittin'
I'm the one packing a MAC in the back of a black truck
While y'all niggas be sleeping you need to be peeping a color
Slam through your speakers
Hit one of the tweeters
Lyrical styles I disperse is harder than your peter
{Wait, how did she know?}
You better ask them about me
I hit 'em up, get 'em up
Then I spit 'em up like loogies
Fucking around? Test me
I'll hex you like a voodoo
Get an ass like Charmin and flush you like a poo poo
Lyrical Smith & Wesson is ready, I got my shotty
Cause when I get to spitting I'm leaving bodies like Gotti
The head banging Madonna's coming like them nigger
Only difference is? Female is my gender
What
Y'all heard me
[Hook x2]

[Hook]
The days are cold living without you
The nights are long, I’m growing older
I miss the days of old, thinking about you
You may be gone, but you’re never over
[Verse 1]
If Proof could see me now, I know he’d be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there’s something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
You try, it’ll be them doors on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns
That means "suicide" homie
, 
you’ll never throw me
Off of this course, blow me! Bitch, I do this all for the sport only
But I want it all, I’m not just talking awards, homie
And the ball's in my court and it’s lonely on top of the world
When you’re the only one with the balls in your shorts
To leave their jaws on the floors with no re-morse
Remember that when they get to dogging you boy, homie
So y’all can just get to blogging about bologna,
 
I’m not gonna stop
The saga
 
continue, no stopping the force Obi, I’m mopping the floors
With them, I keep trying pass it, but they keep on dropping the torch
And it won’t be long til this sport is O-V-E-R
Just Blaze and me
 we are knocking on doors and no we
Ain’t pumpkins on Halloween but we’ll show up on your porch, so be
Careful what you say, there ain’t no punks over here so follow me
Through the fog like I’m S-N-double-O-P
Let me guide you through the smoke G
If only I wasn’t traveling down this road by my lonely
No one who knew me like you will ever know me
I don’t think you understand how much you meant to me
[Hook]
And it don’t stop and it don’t quit
And I miss you, I just miss you
Homie I’ll never forget you
[Verse 2]
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
So sick it’ll blow up the mic, 
It’ll put the "dyna" in mite
Yeah it’ll make the dopest MC wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself
Tap dancing all over the beat,
 
it’ll jump off the page and spit itself
Yeah it’s the best thing I could do right now Doody for you is to rep'
So I'mma fuck til I die, yeah I'mma do it to death
And instead of mourning your death, I’d rather celebrate your life
Elevate to new height, step on the gas and accelerate, I'mma need 2 mics
Cause the way that I’m feeling tonight, everything I can just do right
There’s nothing that I can do wrong, I’m too strong and I’m just too hyped
Just finished the rhyme and I bust it, and - excuse the corny metaphor
They’ll never catch up to all this energy that I’ve mustered
So God just help me out while I fight through this grieving process
Tryna process this loss is making me nauseous
But this depression ain’t taking me hostage
I’ve been patiently watching this game, pacing these hallways
You had faith in me always
Proof you knew I’d come out of this slump, rise from these ashes
Come right back on they asses, and go Mike Tyson on these bastards
And I'mma show them, blow them out the water slaughter them homes
I’mma own so many belts, the only place they can hit me is below them
Homie I know I’m never gonna be the same without you
I never would've came in this game, I’m going insane without you
Matter of fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you
You told me to get up, I got up I spread my wings and I flew
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me "Naw, Doody you’re not!"
 
Laying on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it, soon as you said "Think of Hailie", I knew
There wasn’t no way that I was gonna ever leave them babies
, and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord I’m so thankful, please don’t think that I don’t feel grateful, I do
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you Doody
[Hook]

[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy, oh, crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!
[Verse 1:]
I won some battling, embarrassing, leaving you passed out
Pants down, butt fucked by the Vatican
You show me what a faggot is, 
I'll show you what a Magnum is
You dead in my eyes, I'm just blasting where your casket is
A young bastard, that's beast and crazy
I was found in the street and raised up by Shady
No sound when I speak, but you know what I'm saying
When my trigger finger click, you would know I'm not playing
I'm the climax of Jason, seed of death
In the Ku Klux Klan, hanging niggas to rep
I'm an authentic asshole, choose your step
Or get tekked, next step you would lose your breath
I ain't here to conversate about whose a fake
Cause every time you drop an album, you lose respect
I'm one of a few rappers that do Mathers a G
From the West Coast chapter, of King Mathers, Skreeeeech...
[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!
[Verse 2:]
Lyrical, no subliminal, shitting on you on literal
What you hold, identical to genitals, you dick ridah
Oscillate me from them guys I spit fire
But I'm a murderer and not like them liars
I crush empires, live by us inside of wires
In light of these niggas riddin' by us, try us...
I clip fliers on your lip, then sprint, trying
To rip your fucking mouth off, you bitch... dying
For all standards, flip cannons, shots landing in your face
Now your bodies abandoned, I can show you how to body a bandit
With a shotty I'm standing, in a lobby like Pac nigga, but I ain't get shot
Got grazed, unfazed, gun slang and bang, pump 'cain all day just to earn my name
On the block where I turn my game, I'm Cashis nigga
You motherfuckerz better learn my name, yeeeah...
[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!
[Verse 3:]
Maybe Shady raised a Satan baby
I can feel you hating lately, I've been sniffing, drankin', violating my probation
Ya'll can't take me I'll go crazy, you don't want that situation
Wasting tax payers money, giving me all these cases
My past is a violent one and I can't erase it
I'm getting fresh out of jail, and racing back to the station
Staying wasted, I get the bombest chron, with coke that I lace it
Getting close to Cobain, I drain, I'm there I can taste it
It don't take a million takes for me to walk in and lay it
I got a cater, say these motherfuckin DJs will play it
Walking up congratulated, but inside I feel hated, or maybe it's the hatred inside
I spew cause I'm hating that everyone of my guys died, before I can make it
You the false ridah, I don't like you I can't fake it
See I'm patiently waiting, A buzz bangin', and waving my gun
Pussy quit talkin' shit and close up your lady you punk...
[Hook:]
In this life of a G, the only reason that you listen to me
Is cause you think that I'm crazy, oh, crazy!
I just might be, but you wanna be just like me
Cause you think that I'm crazy!


ZL: Don't be afraid to fail to get somewhere else, to get on the journey.
E: So if you say one thing that's going to spark another thing to lead to a better thought, that's kinda how it went. We started going through old break beats and I was trying to tell him I kinda had the idea, I kinda had a notion that I was going to call it the Marshall Mathers LP 2, but I didn't want to say anything yet to him because I wasn't 100 percent sure- and I wanted to make sure that I had enough songs to even play for him that would make sense. I love the sound that Rick gets when he does hip hop. Even from early on, Beastie Boys- it's incredible. And that's what I was kinda hoping to get.
How can I make the record sound nostalgic, but subliminally nostalgic. So it reminded you of maybe 13 years ago when you first heard me but its overs beats that are even older, but you're not sure why you feel this way. Tried to create a feel, so we started messing with old samples and break beats and things like that- cuz Rick is super talented and mastered of every other genre of music as well. The way he dips in and out of just different genres is crazy to me. Like I said, I was hoping to get what I got from him.
ZL: 
The first time I saw Berzerk as well, I was so happy to see the way that you came through, and the video the way the colors were so reverse Beastie Boy style- it was fan boy stuff for me.
 To be able to go out in a beanie like the Ad-Rock thing and it was cool, I love that.

Zane L
owe: Willkommen zurück bei Radio One, wir sind im Maida Vale studio 4. Teil des Grundes weshalb wir hier sind, ist offensichtlich die BBC, aber auch weil wir Studio 3 gleich um die
 Ecke haben und du dort die Band hast und einige Songs vorspielen wirst.
Eminem: Es ist super toll hier zu sein. Ich hab mir Gedanken darüber gemacht wie ich die Aufmerksamkeit, die dein Interview mit Kanye erhalten hat, übertreffen kann und hab mich dafür entscheiden, hier reinzuspazieren, auf den Boden zu pissen und dann wieder abzuhauen. Ich pisse grade. Wir sehen uns dann später, Leute!
ZL: Dich mit der Band zu sehen und bei den Awards performen und am Mikrofon zu sehen, das war, ich glaube ich habe dich nie lebendiger am Mikrofon gesehen. Es war voller Energie und in dem Moment, was ich bemerkt habe war auch, dass live zu rappen mit der Band hinter dir hat dich viel freier gemacht. Sieht du das auch so?
E: I denke, dass performen anders geworden ist, es ist mit der Band besser geworden, weil da jetzt noch mehr Elemente da sind und weil es eine Live-Show ist gibt es auch mehr Möglichkeiten.  Es gibt Dinge, die du mit deinen Händen machen kannst. Es es ist wirklich cool, es ist anders. Ich denke, es ist besser.
ZL: Rap God zu rappen relativiert alles, denke ich, für alle anderen. Als du das geschrieben hast und dann fertig warst und aufgenommen hast…
E: Ich hab das nicht geschrieben, I hab das gefreestyled, aus dem Kopf, 1 Aufnahme.
ZL: Absolut irre. Der Song ist irre, aber ergibt irgendwie keinen Sinn.
E: Danke.
ZL: Wenn du den Song live spielst muss das, ich hab das gesehen als du fertig warst, eine Herausforderung für alle sein. Am Ende musst du dich nach dem Motto ‚Wow‘ fühlen. Das sind viele Reime durch die man durch muss. Das sind 5 oder 6 Minuten ununterbrochen.
E: Uhm, ja, Ich denke wir haben am anderen Abend gar nicht den ganzen Song gespielt. Mehr so ein Deadly Medley.
ZL: Ich weiß gar nicht, wie man das aufteilen und eine kürzere Version davon machen würde, weil das einfach so ein Bewusstseinsstrom durch das ganze Lied ist.
E: Ja, keine Ahnung. I will gar darüber nachdenken, weil ich denke, dass es ein… Bewusstseinsstrom ist. Netter Bewusstseinsstrom, der mein Bein runterläuft.
ZL: Das Ablum selbst ist von allen, auch den Fans weltweit, sehr gut aufgenommen worden. Weil es meiner Meinung nach, wenn man das jetzt so hört, nahezu die perfekte Mischung aus der Gehässigkeit und der Gefahr, die auch schon auf deiner ersten Platte da war, aber auch was du durchgemacht hast und was du in den letzten 5 oder 6 Jahren gelernt hast. Es ist irgendwie eine Mischung aus den beiden.  Denkst du, das geht so in Ordnung? Das erste Album, das sich etwas erwachsener anfühlt, aber auch zurück zu den ursprünglichen Themen und verarbeitet das.
E: Es ist erwachsener und auch nicht. Ich meine, einige der Motive und Themen und Dinge werden in diesem Album wiederaufgenommen, aber gleichzeitig ist es wie eine 2013 Version davon.  Alle meine Alben, denke ich, zeigen meistens wo ich grade bin, du weißt bei jedem zu dieser Zeit war das und so weiter.  Es ist irgendwie, es wird viel reflektiert und so über Dinge, die zu der Zeit passiert sind, weißt du. Und es ist so, dass ich über diese reflektiere und an dem Punkt angelange an dem ich jetzt bin.
ZL: Einige Rechnungen werden auch beglichen und Kriegsbeile begraben und endlich mit Dingen abzuschließen. Denkst du, dass das Album dir dies erlaubt hat?
E: Ich meine, einige Sachen ja. Aber zum größten Teil wäre es lustig dahin zurückzugehen, die ganze Stimmung des Albums. Einfach weil es während der Aufnahmen so gekommen ist.
ZL: Wann hat das angefangen?
E: I hatte damit angefangen einige Songs aufzunehmen und es klang einfach wie der Stil und Atmosphäre davon, die Songs gingen so in diese Richtung. Und da hab ich dann rausgefunden in welche Richtung das ganze gehen soll, damit angefangen alles so auf diese Art und Weise zu machen. Häufig, beim Album machen, habe ich Richtung oder das Konzept noch gar nicht am Anfang. Manchmal kommt das gar nicht bis zur Mitte bzw. gegen Ende der Aufnahmen dazu, dass ich rausfinde wo ich damit hin will… das ist einfach eine Ansammlung an Liedern, je nach dem wie der Vibe ist. Manchmal mache ich Songs die so aus heiterem Himmel kommen, ein oder zwei davon und es ist so Scheiße, wo packe ich die Lieder hin and wie nenne ich es, weil es keinen Sinn mehr macht, z.B. Recovery oder so. Aber bei diesem Album habe ich das Gefühl, dass ich recht früh eine Idee für das Konzept hatte.
ZL: Das muss dann ganz cool sein, in der Lage zu sein sich hinzusetzen und es während des ganzen zu gestalten mit einem Endergebnis im Kopf, es so zusammenzusetzen.
E: War es, aber auch nicht, im Sinne von – I musste viele Lieder aufnehmen, weil ich fühle, dass ich es so nennen werden, ich möchte Sinn ergeben.


I think that had a lot to do with it, and then, you know, watching NWA and other people, 2Pac, you know what I'm saying, like, it was like, he's not going to, him or they, aren't going to kiss your ass to make you like their music.
[Zane Lowe over snippet from "Survival"]
Yeah, that's exactly what they want to do, let things slide a bit, you know. Now, you kind of talk about that on this song here, 
on The Monster (plays snippet from "The Monster")
, and I think this is the one where you really address it in the most eloquent way about like, it's the gift and the curse, you know, I'm aware of the trouble it can get you in, I've been through that, you know. Number 1 album, number 1 movie, number 1 this number 1 that, not really in a position to really, kind of, really, be able to absorb that, yet, it's intoxicating, isn't it?
[Eminem]
Yeah, it was like, it was this thing, where, and I'm not gonna lie, I still wish it today, that it was like this thing where I want this attention for this music, but then I wanna be able to go in public, and I wanna be able to eat a fucking sandwich, you know what I mean, and be left alone. So, it was like "man, if I could...", because, I'd never been an attention seeker, and it seems like a hell of a career choice, you know, but, I don't like attention, that's not just why I do it, just to get attention, I don't like to be in public and walk around and be, like, here I am, you know what I mean, like, it's not what I want, I just wanted, my dream was, my dream was for like, fuck man, to be able to one day, like hear rappers that I look up to on the radio, like "yo, what if Jay Z, whoever, what if they heard of me, what if they thought I was dope? You know what I'm saying like? That was where my mentality always was, was with it. So when it all went crazy it was really hard to wrap my head around, you know, a lot of it still is, but especially back then.
[Zane Lowe]
Yeah. You know, you have done something which very few people have done now, you've actually been at the center of the world, the center of that storm, and you've emerged out of it, you popped out of the other side of it, I mean. Elvis didn't do that, you know, Michael Jackson didn't do that, Whitney Houston... a lot of people who have been in the public eye to that extent, unfortunately the list of various reasons, I'm sure personal to them, is too long, who didn't make it through. You have, and what does the world look like to you, when you've come out the other side of that, and you're 5 years sober and you're looking on that chaos for some perspective?
[Eminem]
Urm, I don't know, I mean I'm definitely thankful, you know what I mean, I know that could have certainly took another path...
[Zane Lowe]
And gone that way, yeah.
[Eminem]
Yeah, I could have went another direction but, I don't know, I mean, I think that, I feel like, like I'm probably able to see it, I'm able to be more focused now than I've ever been, urm, but I'm also able to I guess put it in perspective. The problem is I can't put a lot of perspective because I don't, there's a lot that's, you know, gone, there's a lot that I don't remember, and maybe that's cool, too, you know what I'm saying, where...
[Zane Lowe]
Probably a good thing?
[Eminem]
Yeah but, I don't know man, I know, I know that, there's so many addicts in this world, you know, and people who have problems like that, that don't make it, you know what I'm saying so I, I'm thankful for that, but urr, you know, I think that's one thing that really helps me, urr, through, and just, keeps me pushing forward is the music, is the passion for that and, and, and, you know.

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Yo.. Slim Shady!
Yo.. I'll fucking.. I'll...
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you (eww)
Battle? I'm too weedy to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
(Bitch!) I ain't no fucking G, I'm a cannibal
I ain't tryin to shoot you
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes strapped to a soaking mattress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers (ahhh!)
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis
I'm so bananas I'm showing up to your open casket
To fill it full of explosive gasses
And close it back with a lit match in it
While I sit back and just hope it catches
Blow you to fragments
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes
[Hook]
I see the light at the end
But every time I take a step, it gets dim
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
If so, heaven's got to be better
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down
[Verse 2: J-Black]
Am I the worst? Because I, never go to church (never)
I run a red light then sideswipe a hearse
I'mma drink 'til my liver rot, see the doc
Leave the E.R., then hit a bar for a liquor shot, 'til the liver spot
One day we all gon' die
But when I die, I'mma be so high
That I'mma get up and walk, leaving the concrete bare
With the chalk outline still there
I smoke until I choke and I sex a lot
I got a cross on my chain but it's just a rock
Now if I pray everynight (night)
Do I still have to hold my tray very tight?
You feel me God? I done did so much shit while on Earth
I smoke, I drink, I curse, and to make matters worse
I bust my gun first, and then I chat with your corpse
Since way back, I was one to never like back-talk
See me at the pearly gates in line, wearing a Nordface
Nickle nine at my waist, Father lost faith
Angels greet me but I don't reply back
Just show me to my quarters, and oh yeah, where's Thai at?
[Hook]
[Announcer]
Maxie was seriously wounded but the soul still burns
Final battle, fight!
[Verse 3: Masta Ace]
Analyze the strength of my game, like Lee Corso
Call me a lost soul, with a vest on my torso
And of course, yo, y'all know I'm no stranger to danger
Like Christ in a manger, feel a whole range of my anger
I breathe down shit so hard you can see sound
And beat down these rap clowns in like three rounds
My pen about as sharp as a dagger, walk with a swagger
Tie your wife to the back of a blackjack and I drag her
Ten blocks, untie the bitch and I still bag her
Give her a smack in the ass and a six pack of lager
My shit go as deep and as dark as a train tunnel
My flows spill like using the wrong end of a funnel
Everyday I grow more older, and more colder
Fly you to Colorado, roll you over with a boulder
I know you want to retaliate but you won't dare
Cause you fucking with some niggas like this who just don't care
[Hook]
[J-Black]
But every time I take a step, it gets dim..
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?
Haha..
[Announcer]
Time's up!
You lose!

[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, I don’t know what else to say
I can’t, I can’t think of nothing, I’m stumped
Here we go! On your feet, stand up, everybody hands up
Uh, man, I don't know man, every time I go to think of something played out to say, you already said it
[Verse 1]
I ain't callin' names cause all of y'all the same
Plus I'm the king, all my past pain all done changed up
All these plains, all these lames, since the Slaughter's came up
Cause they know their hands tied, feet ball and chained up
Niggas be quick to call me the new 50 Cent because of my relationship
With Marshall
 
used to make me a little partial,
 
but here's the brain fuck
We the same, cause I'm probably 'bout to fall out with a young buck
While I attempt to fuck the fuckin' game up
Bitch, splat! Only thing I fear in here is chit-chat
You are hearin' bars like your ear against a Kit Kat
Shady guys like the Navy, try us, wavey bye-bye
Maybe my Glock can turn your top to Baby's Maybach
My shit is parvo, literally sick
Trust me, nigga, it's ugly to kill; the thing is, the bigger I get
The more disgustin' and fuckin' disfigured it gets
Niggas expect me to go pop, oh, stop
Y'all about the champagne, I'm about the toast,
 
I
Only fuck with mailmen with heroin from Boca
Niggas that'll smoke you while you starin' in your postbox
Only incense he enlightens when he's thinkin'
While that sinks in,
 
I got a Brinks ink pen
I'm back! Motherfucker notice the flyness on the cover
Of the XXL
, 
I'm back from the dead like Tobey Maguire from the Brothers
How y'all realer? If I said it, I did it
If I didn't, I seen it first-hand like a card dealer
Give up the throne: your lease up;
 
I am the Mona Lisa
That decoded Da Vinci Code,
 
you throwin' your piece up
Is a waste of fake like a phony B-cup
Making the mistake was like my only teacher
Wait 'til they get a load of me cause
[Hook]
I've got Guccis on my feet,
 
diamonds on my neck
Diamonds on my wrist,
 
bitches on my dick,
 
but y'all already said that
Choppers in the trunk,
 
models in the front
Bottles in the club,
 
but I don't give a fuck, but y'all already said that
[Bridge: Eminem]
Cause sometimes I feel like it's so hard for me
To come up with shit to say, ay
I'm at a loss for words, cause y'all already said it all
I think I'm running outta clichés – I'm getting writers block,
 
psyche!
[Verse 2]
When I stand up in this booth, niggas notice it
Sittin' on the same boat that Noah built
Floatin' on the same water Moses split
Poetry in motion, 
but we sittin' on your grave site: overkill
Aren't you tired? Why are you so loud? Quiet
Real dudes move in silence, like a mute drivin' a new hybrid
You dudes is too excited
You a dude that'd try to sue a dude that's suicidal
You will just be another victim
I am like a nickel of weed rolled in a doobie - I'm a little twisted
I roll like the end credits in movies,
 
y'all just got scripted
Got y'all niggas' bitches bobbin' to this one when she wit ya
When she with me, she bobbin', not vibin' tryna put her mind into the inside of my zipper
I'm a serpent with a purpose, havin' problems? Not a problem
I've encountered, I have found elephants, lions, clowns
Will jump through hoops like they workin' for the circus
If the fire 'round the circle's right in front of them, fire rounds
Pun intended,
 gun extended, what are you marks askin'?
Car's Aston,
 
started as a hard-top and I saw past it
Since I decided to start class this, all black, all glass
Panoramic roof been gettin' marked absent
I authorize my own all-access
Your bitch a whore, I'm a catch, she ball-catchin'
Her jaw's been broadcasted all across the globe from the store to Japan
Her pussy need to be blocked and reported as spam
Interscope I been this dope, now sell it
My voicemail is full, got bitches screamin' inside of envelopes
And they tryna mail ‘em to me
, 
Tryna reach my phone
I don't know which one is harder: Tryna not to take your bitch or tryna get rid of my own
[Hook + Bridge]
[Outro: Eminem]
Man, get the bozac, we need to start bringin' that shit back
 (Mad flava!)
Man, fuck it, I'm 'bout to catch some wreck
 (We in effect, money!)
Mad props to Royce for keepin' it real on the strength, no diggity
I'm 'bout to go pull some hoes, get my mack on, haters get the gas face!

[Verse 1: Eminem]
Here I Go
Lyrical
I have no Idea, what I'm doing
But I'm spiritual
On the microphone
I tear you up in ste-re-o
I'm like the grand wizard
Yes, I'm the Impe-ri-al
I have no fucking clue
What the fuck I'm doing
But "
Freifick, Muschi
"
Your whole life is ruined
If you try to step to me
Your life's a jeopardy
Cause I will seek you out
[
Hook

Zucker im Kaffee
Und Zitrone oder Sahne in den Tee
Und dazu den ganzen Tag lang nur Amor
Das ist wunderbar, Señor
[Stefan Raab to Eminem]
(now its your part again, its your part again, its your part again)
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Yes...
here we go
Break it down
I got the crown
I'm bout to take it now
Yo, I got my man
And he's on the guitar
And when it comes to lyrics
I go so far
Like a car that I'm driving
Surviving off Vivarin
I'm alive
I'm like 
eye of the tiger
And I kick it so
So, fucking hard
Now "
Freifick, Muschi

Don't 
diss
 me regard

Fuckin wit Lotto dog you gotta be kiddin
That makes me believe, you really don't have an interest in livin
You think these niggas gonna feel the shit you say?
I got a better chance joinin the KKK
On some real shit though, I like you
That's why I didn't wanna have to be the one you commit suicide to
Fuck Lotto? Call me ya leader

I used to like that show
Now you got me in fightback mode
But oh well if ya gotta go then ya gotta go

So I'll take pictures of my rear end so you won't forget my ass
And alls well that ends ok

[Eminem vs Lotto]
Ward
I think you were a little hard on the Beaver
So was Eddie Haskal
Wally and Ms. Cleaver
This guy keeps screamin, he's paranoid
Quick, someone get his ass another steroid!
Blabbedy bloom blah, blum blabbedy bloom blah
I ain't hear a word you said, hibitit hoopla!

Look, Snoop Dogg, just got a fuckin boob job
Did you listen to the last round meathead?
Pay attention, ya sayin the same shit that he said
Matta fact dog, here's a pencil
Go home, write some shit, make it suspenseful
And don't come back until somethin dope hits you
Fuck it
You can take the Mic home with you
Lookin like a cyclone hit you
Tanktop screamin, "Lotto I don't fit you"
You see how far them white jokes get you
Boys like, how Vanilla Ice gone diss you?
My motto: Fuck Lotto
I get the 7 digits from ya mother for a dollar tomorrow
[Eminem vs Papa Doc]
Now everybody from the 313
Put your mother-fuckin hands up and follow me
Everybody from the 313 put your mother-fuckin hands up
Look, look
Now while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
The Free World got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the big bad wolf?
1, 2, 3 and to the 4
1pac, 2pac, 3pac, 4
4pac, 3pac, 2pac, 1
You're pac, he's pac, no pac, none
This guy ain't no mother-fuckin MC
I know everything he's got to say against me
I am white, I am a fuckin bum, I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named cheddar bob who shoots
Himself in the leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all 6 of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin here screamin "FUCK THE FREE WORLD!"
And never try and judge me dude
You don't know what the fuck i've been through
But I know something about you
You went to CRANBROOK, thats a private school
Whats the matter dawg, you embarrased?
This guy's a gangsta?
His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence's parents have a real good marriage
This guy dont wanna battle, he's shook
Cause ain't no such thing as halfway crooks!
He's scared to death
He's scared to look in his fuckin yearbook, fuck CRANBROOK
Fuck a beat I go accapella
Fuck a papa doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer, fuck everybody
Fuck y'all if you doubt me
I'm a piece of fuckin white trash I say it proudly
Fuck this battle I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Here -- tell these people something they dont know about me

Left right left we stand our ground left right left we all fall down like a grown soldier I'm supposed to be a soldier who never blows his composier but the world already knows it but it's not to late for me to blow it even though i have the weight of the world on my shoulders i don't ever stop trying to keep people from dying.and try to keep people from dying but as long as im up no one can stop me from trying cause no matter how hard i want to stop all this this shit keeps getting escalated sometimes i feel like im am the main cause for this but the people of this town they give me a god damn fucking frown

(Intro: Linkin Park)
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey
It goes one, two, three
(Verse 1: Linkin Park)
I was born with the hunger of a lion
The strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no I make the track run
My Momma taught me words, my Daddy built rockets
I hold them both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty smart weapon I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it, because you clearly can't stop it like that
(Verse 2: Linkin Park)
It ain't over because the shark's on the left side the snake's on the right
And everything you do, they want to get a little bite
But it really doesn't matter if your wrong or if your right
Because once they get there teeth in nothing really fights
And as for me I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like your trying to fill my shoes
But steady little soldier I ain't standing next to you
I'll be laying on the ground before you're even in my view, Like that
(Chorus: linkin Park)
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
When the last bells ring, the poor man sings
Bring me to Kingdom come
(Verse 3: Eminem)
I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breath
Last shot, give it all you got
Try to turn me down bitch, get fucked with the volume knob
Fuck all you snobs
Hoes I hope all you rot
Two bottles of Lubriderm and a box of condoms, is that all you brought
And you wanna menage a trois you twats
Fuck that i'd rather turn this club into a bar room brawl
Get as rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech in a vacuum y'all, ain't nothing but a whole lot of sucking going on in rap
Yeah, but i'm home
Bad to the bone
Back in the zone
Let him alone
You don't want to go egging him on
It'll never be my chair that you're on
Crown so tight it cuts off circulation to the brain, no oxygen
Other words there's no heir to the thrown
When I die, so does Hip-Hop
Hitchcock, better shit bitch ass got a zip locked in a bag
You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone like I'm in the twilight
Talking of my bone this is my mic dog I like hogging it
Flow so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganing
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplex it on cement like I'm on some straight out of Compton shit
Take this dick and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment
Jack ass eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it, like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit!
I reign supreme in this honkey shit
No sense screaming, and arguing
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in
(Chorus: Linkin Park)
Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
When the last bells ring, the poor man sings
Bring me to Kingdom come

[Verse I]
Hi!
Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase
I laced the weed with insect repellent, better check the smelly
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling
With a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my Adam's apple (hurry up!)
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure
That my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months
And said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feeling these kicks cunt?"
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphilis germs
And I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach
And vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it (yuck!)
(Yuck!) Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it
And all that gibberish you was spitting, you need to kill it
Cause your style is like dying in my sleep, I don't feel it
[Hook]
Cause any man who would jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a Mini Thin
Is fucking crazy -- you hear me? Ha?
Is fucking crazy -- hello, hi!
Cause any man who 
would
 jump in front of a minivan
For twenty grand and a bottle of pain pills and a Mini Thin
Is fucking crazy -- do you hear me?
Is fucking crazy
[Verse II]
I'm ice grilling you, staring you down with a gremlin grin
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias
To save me with in case I get chased by space aliens
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium
Than a maniac Saudi Arabian
A highly combustible head, spazmatic
Strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition
I flat-lined; jumped up and ran from the mortician
High speed, IV full of Thai weed
Looking Chinese, with my knees stuck together like Siamese
Twins, joined at the groin like lesbians
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends
On if I keep on killing my girlfriends
[Hook]
[Verse III]
Last night I OD'd on rush, mushrooms and dust
And got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed
(Shucks!) I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day
Of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be (RRARRRRH)
Give me eleven Excedrin my head'll spin
Medicine'll get me revving like a 747 jet engine
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"
"It's probably AIDS!" Forget it then
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows
That don't even make sense, like dykes using dildos
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats
And pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus
Something something something, something I get weeded
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it
Damn!
[Hook]
[Outro]
Something's not right
I'm sorry
I'm mentally retarded
Slim Shady
I think that's my name
Rawkus Records
Fucking Crazy
You hear us?
We're fucking crazy
All of us
Hi....bye
Nine something....

[Intro: Bizarre]
Time waits for no one
It's time to be a man
[Verse 1:  Bizarre]
If your got kids, you know what I'm talking 'bout
But do like I did and just walk the fuck out
For 10 years I been smoking crack
But now I'm back to get my litte girl back (hey there)
I'm on 8 mile with an attitude, science said work for full
Butt-naked in the noon (damn)
Forced to be a man with nowhere to go
Shit I just stopped smoking crack an hour ago
With the hope and a prayer my life is finished
I never smile cause I need to see a dentist (damn)
It was all good when mama was paying the rent
But she died to weeks ago in a car accident
And when the fuck the find me in the cardboard box
With dirty socks, drinking a bottle of scotch
I want cock so bad I suck your grandfathers cock
Give me that rock or get sucked!
[Hook: Eminem]
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(Time for me to be a man)
I watch her grow up with pride
(step up and take irresponsibility)
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(It just all happens so fast)
I watch her grow up with pride
(what I wanna do?)
[Verse 2: Bizarre]
My little girl wants to be a ballet dancer (dady)
Last week she was diagnosed with cancer
It took me 2 years to spot it
And the cancer she got, ain't nobody got it
And I'm trying to stay strong, I want my little girl to live long
Thats why I'm writing poems and writing songs
Health insurance they ain't paying no cash
Thats why I'm selling glass, If I have to I'll sell my *ass*
Look at me an irresponsible father and been here
For half an hour and ready to run like a coward
Lord please don't take my little girl's life
So she can skate on ice and learn how to ride a bike
[Hook: Eminem]
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(Yeah I love my little girl)
I watch her grow up with pride
(Watching her grow up)
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(Takes a real man to stick around)
I watch her grow up with pride
(The fuck I wanna do?)
[Verse 3: Bizarre]
She been up all night crying and hurting and the chemical theory
It ain't working and I can't afford the operation
Not even if I rob a gas station
Looking dirty, stanky and beat in the shower
I don't smoke cigarettes, I'm killing a pack in an hour
My little girl said 
"
daddy I'm going to have it"
Look at my princess, fighting, only 7
Any minute my daughter can pass away
And her favorite group is B2K
Sing motherfucker! sing! sing motherfucker!
"gotta be that one that you deserve
Gotta be the one that you can hold
Gotta be gotta be your everything, don't kill me Bizarre!"
Hahaha, you little motherfuckers
"if you got kids, what the fuck would you do?"
This ain't Bizarre, this is John Q with a loaded 22. (bow!)
Me and my TEC-9, I load her and cock her
Everybody going to hell, even the doctor
[Hook: Eminem]
My baby girl, keeps getting older
I watch her grow up with pride
(The fuck am I supposed to do?)
My baby girl, keeps getting older
(I mean, I mean what would you do in this situation?)
I watch her grow up with pride
(I'm just a product of the world)
My baby girl..

صدای میکروفنم رو بالا ببر
صدای میکروفنم رو بالا ببر
[Hook : Busta Rhymes]
آروم به راست) هی، آروم باش مرد
آروم به چپ) هی، آروم باش مرد
آروم به راست) هی، آروم باش مرد
آروم به چپ) بی خیال، کنترل خودتون رو از دست بدین!
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
خدای من، تابوت رو پایین تر بیار
خاکستر رو بپاش، تو باعث میشی شکست بخوری، پاو!
وقتی به تاج و تختت بی احترامی می کنم ناراحت شو، از شهر برو
همه چیز با خاک یکسان میشه
من باعث میشم بگن واو؟ جر می خوره، اَو، باو!
من اسلحه همراهمه، کلیک، پاو!
بلاو، کلیک، کلیک، پاو، کلیک، پاو!
باعث ترافیک میشم وقتی کار کلاسیک پخش می کنم، حالا برش گردون
دخترا باعث میشم از تو دور شن
تو واقعا نمی خوای شروع کنی چون غرّش می کنم
(راور، راور، راور) بگذار من بیام و بازنده ها رو جمع کنم
وقتی شروع کنم هیچ وقت تمومش نمی کنم چون
وقتی ما میایم، بهتره درها رو قفل کنی
گرگ ها می خوان بخورن، ببین آرواره هاشون چطور قفل میشه
نیازی نیست کوکایین رو بپزم، ببین چطور خام قطع می کنم
و اگه به اندازه کافی نداشتی
بشین و لذتش رو ببر
چه خبره؟ با بیت برگشتم و رپ خشن هست
و ناخن هاشون رو می جَون و خودشون رو خیس کردن
و مثل تخمه آفتاب گردون ضعیف می شکنمشون
ببین این مهارت ها وزنم رو بالا بردن مثل سه تا وال
و میرینم به این مردا تا بدتر از بوی وید بو بدن
مرد تو از درخت افتادی
ببین چطور توییتر، فیسبوک و اینستاگرام یا ایمیل می کنن
حرف می زنن، فوق العاده هستم و به لرزه انداختمشون
با فروش بالا جوابشون رو میدم و ناتوانشون می کنم
ببین می پزم جوری که انگار بیزنس وید راه انداختم
و سه گرم بهشون میدم و مثل دخترا دنبال خودم می کشونمشون (صدای نفس کشیدن)
اُوه خوب ببین، این مردم الان می دونن
چطور همه چیز رو خراب می کنم، جدا از جزئیات
این پرونده تمومه، دوست دخترت منو یاد تعویضم می اندازه
ولی یه جورایی مثل یه هرزه کهنه هست
پایین میره جوری که انگار سکس تو زیرزمینه
ورم می کنه مثل این که تو شکمشون چوب می کنم
خیلی مودبانه، به طور دردناک اینا رو از خواب بیدار می کنم
مثل عروسک باهاشون رفتار می کنم و مثل میمونی که گیر افتاده بهشون حمله می کنم
منتظر تسخیر کردنم
و گردنشون رو مثل دستبند می شکنم، لعنتی
یه جورایی مثل وقتیه که با مشروب مست تو کامیون نشستم و دارم مسابقه میدم
ازشون رد میشم
و می زنمشون تا وقتی بمیرن
گذاشتم خوشحال تر از بچه ای بشن که تو پارک یه اردک رو دنبال می کنه
الان دیگه خنده داره که دنبال پولم، اینا هنوز دنبال بخت و اقبال هستن
مثل چکمه گره شون می زنم
وقتی صورتشون رو تو شُل فشار می دم (اَه)
موشک پرتاب می کنم وقتی وحشیانه رپ می کنم
بعد تو یه حرکت دایره ای برمی گردن
آتش بیشتری برای من فراهم میشه تا سطحش رو آب کنم
و صدا رو برگردونم
درحالی که آتیش می زنم چیزایی رو که پرتاب می کنم
پرستش خدایان رو ترک می کنم، به اطرافت نگاه کن
با  قدرت جوری کوبیدم که همشون به اطراف پخش شدن
حیف شد که خردشون کردم، باید پاره می کردم
سرت رو از شونه هات
با گلوله هایی بزرگ تر از یه صخره
بشکنمشون و می دونن که یه کلاسیکه
و این جوری که پیش میره می دونی که راحت شکست می خوری
ببین من و شِیدی باهم دیوونه ایم
مثل ساختن یه بمب خونگی تو آشپزخونه مثل آشپزها، تو یه هرزه ای
(ما این قدر فوق العاده ایم؟)
چون از هایتی میام، بهت پیشنهاد می کنم بهم پول بدی
نگذار دیوونه شم (آلالالا)
مثل یه اسرائیلی دیوونه ام، حرامزاده ها
وقتی که بیت رو می خورم و بیت رو گرم می کنم
پاهات رو قطع می کنم و الان مال من هستن
و با خیال راحت پاهام رو بالا می اندازم
به محله برگشتم و وحشی گری می کنم
امیدوارم مواظب بچت باشی
و مدت ها کنترلم رو از دست داده بودم
اینا می پرسن هوک مرده، نه
ولی بیت سرخ شده!
[Hook : Busta Rhymes]
[Verse 2 : Eminem]
این انتقاد یکمی مسریه
ممکنه مریضت کنه
پس با این ناراحت شو، مغز من درست مثل تخم مرغ سرخ شده هست
ذهنم به هم خورده هست؟ (چون شعله ورم) ذهنم باریکه
ولی رد شدن مقدار زیادی از این حس این قدر مشکله
که خشم من باید از گوشه و کنارش بیرون بزنه
همین الان جلوی خونه کلیو دِیویس پیاده شدم
با خاطرات شخصیش که می گفت دو جنس گراست
یه تک ناین تکون میدم، یه نشونه اعتراض و رو ماشینش تخم مرغ می کوبم
مجبورش می کنم فریاد بزنه "تجاوز جنسی" و بعد لخت می رسم
و مستقیم می رونم بین جشن کارنیوال همجنس گراها
ییپیــ-کیــ-یِی، و من اینجا
صبر کن، دنیا همین الان رو پام خیس کرد؟
و باید به عنوان یه نشونه برداشت کنم؟ و شاید به گذشته ها ببرمشون (شیدی)
انگشت نما بودم، پس انگشت رو بهشون نشون دادم
تا توجه شون رو از صورتم دور کنم
همه رنگ بازی رو تغییر دادم
ولی فقط در صورتی که به این فکر می کردی که
بنویسی و رئیس رو عوض کنی
دیوونه ای، در اون صورت جوهر هدر میدی
پس اگر این نشونه ای از چیزیه که شاید باهاش روبرو بشی
بهتره یه تفاوتی ایجاد کنی چون تقلید مسخرت
یه تجربه بد ایجاد می کنن، لعنت به گذاشتن تاثیر بد
این بدترین تاثیرگذاریه که من دیدم و
کی تودماغی رپ می کنه، چشماش قهوه ایه و با دیوانه گری قافیه میگه
ولی به نظر میاد فلوناز لازم داره وقتی داره حرف می زنه؟
این چه سوال احمقانه ایه؟
هی، خانم آبراهام لینکن
جدا از مغز لعنتی شوهرت که چکه می کرد
به نظرت اون نمایش آخر هفته چطور بود؟
تو اسلیم شیدی واقعی نیستی، بشین سر جات، همجنس گرا
منو تو انتخابات می بینی؟ برای دلقک کلاس تلاش می کنم
دموکرات پولدار، هرزه، پس من فقط یه کاندیدم
تا بیام و همه پارتی رو به فنا بدم
من و دیوونه گریم با هم یه کمپین راه انداختیم[Verse 1 : koustav]
I stand on my feet, on the grass
I can't believe in myself, I'm broken in parts
In two parts, one is good and other evil
For my life, I can't choose the good and curse the evil
Lies beneath my earth, I got my body with those deep scars
I fly an aircraft and withstand the weak power
So my mind retarded and my father, a faggot
Congratulations, you got a baby, who's the babies father?
I'm pissed off because I'm nobody to handle a baby
This heavy baby got my veins raged, my veins got bursted and I slammed on my face
I was fifteen, still I was better, why I was just growing up to develop beard
I was confirmed when my wife's got pregnant, I wished I had a baby, but then, I'm buried in a closet
To get divorced, I have to enforce her, out of the house, I'm filled with envy, not that she was so wrong
I performed a song on the stage, this was my song that would convey message
I'm nobody, I'm piece of crap,so throw me in trash,I can't get a hold on my cash
Again, I go to flashback, I had no girlfriends, then my crazy notes will be of no use
If I can't convey my message
Talking to my baby, I feel pain
How is she? I wonder
[Verse 2: Eminem]
If I could get one more chance to see her
Then run to her destination, where is she?
I had got no wings to fly,but I've a mind
To interpret all the consequences to foresee, to get a nice chance, deprive  of basic amenities
I'm no tribal to live in jungles, but I'm a man, a part of this evolution
I can involve a cushion when I'm resting on my sofa
In fact I have no money,no bucks, to buy a loaf of bread
If I could get an answer from the god, I could go with him
No one there is to accept my faults and my grievances
I can't find an answer, till I'm grown,I'm no Nostradamus to make predictions
After addictions, I reverted from a bad cancer of lungs
I was full of catholic school, but now doctors prescribed the chicken stew
Back in actions I got a destiny that can seek repentance
[Verse 3: lil Wayne]
If I had been a chain smoker
I would put my mind into poker
Poke her, as she got buns out of her sweater
Place the dick in her anus, and sweat her
Later, she was killed herself, when you left her
As she said, "I hate you", I said that I dated you
For that fucking felling, I was fucked up and slew
If you could be me, you will now how much depressed I am
For that fucking period, I curse my own eye
Why it saw you? ,motherfucker
I cursed myself that it was just an attraction

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-aag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, oh that's my pigment
Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(Go berserk) all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(Go berserk) all night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it, before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berserk) Grab your vial, yeah
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it
Khaki's pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't
That aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl, your body's bangin', jump me in, dang, bang-bang
Yessiree Bob, I was thinkin' the same thang
So come get on this Kid's rock, Bawitdaba, dang-dang
Pow-pow, chica, pow, chica, wow-wow
Got your gal blowing up a valve, valve-valve
Ain't slowing down, throw in the towel, towel-towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how-how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho...
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
I say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (go berzerk) Get your vinyls
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am trying to find a way to get you a-loan (car note)
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl you're fixing to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd ma'am, you birdbrain baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow
Word Rick, word man you heard, but don't get discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam



[Verse 1: Eminem]
Like a dope fiend
Opening up a bottle of Dopamine
He goes to get the rope to your throat he can choke anything
Oh and just think, how dope he could be if he smoked anything
Oh, there goes the bell, the sound of the opening ding
I hit you as hard as barbiturates in the ribs with a switch
And stitch you at the same time before you can flinch to it
My dick is so big if I add another inch to it
You would swear when I raped you that you was actually into it
I'm not a baller but you can bet your fucking bottom dollar
That I remember when I was without a dollar bill in my wallet
Now watch me kill a koala, while I maul a chihuahua
Bum a pill off of Paula like let me holla at you mama
It's like I'm off the ba-ba when I bring the fucking drama
I used to bomb ya like Saddam but now that I'm a little calmer
I'm a fucking cross between Osama, Dahmer, Obama, and Dalai Lama
Told Miley I'm a knight in shining armor
Mail a gift to Taylor Swift's trailer, a picture of my genitalia
With a note saying bitch I can't wait to nail ya
Drug paraphernalia, beware the werewolf will kill ya
That's him in his sheep's clothes he just shaved his hair off Cecilia

Line one Eminem- Yeah. Yeah. Boy f**k teachers. F**k cops
R-Truth- Dude think he gots money, but the nigger broke


[Hook - K.K.Yo]
Imma make him kill the crowd
My head is spinning round and round
Yeah, Imma busting in
Imma make the gold digger shake fake
And make him scream out loud
Yeah, Imma busting in
[Verse 1 - Ludacris]
Yo I be tripping b**ches driving heading out coast
East coast driving n*ggers to building, just no time
To be facing these lame assholes blocking my whole f**king way
If they wanna prevent me from busting they can't stay
Imma go with K.K., avoid KK Klu Klux traiting d**ks
And before you know it I can show it
And tell him 'bout my past totally first class
Imma make the p*ssy blast the cannon with my lass
[Verse 2 - K.K.Yo]
I'm climbing up the wall, make myself look so tall
It looks like I'm erecting, bought a spray from the stall
I lost my reading glasses heading to the other side
I will find a girl, give her such a bumpy ride
But I ain't will.i.am, it is a new day
Where is the love? I always wonder when I play
I'm in the Wild West and I shooting all the prats
I'll be blowing off their faces and then stealing all their hats
[Verse 3 - Leastah]
You got to the right path, and I give you lame s**t
They might all think about me when I show him my lame s**t
They still might not talk about s**t when they don't all see my s**t
Bit they might f**k me up when they all see some other lacked s**t
Killed them in a party, I party with the stars
They say I am a b**ch, but I can drive a car
I must have got drunk last night, but I still drinking
Should I give it up, I always consider thinking
[Verse 4 - Eminem]
What's that? You wanna calm down? You must have got f**ked, because I'm down
I saw the king, Quuen Elizabeth, must have broken their crowns
But I can see the water, it looks a purple-red
I must have had three chickens sleeping in my kingsized bed
I must've yanked a vodka, because I got a struck
I must have tripped over dirt, now I'm covered in muck
What what? You are barking up the wrong tree
That is just because the spotlight is right on me
[Hook]
[Verse 5 - Critcraft]
I must've gotten lost
I have had a lot to cost
I have been p*ssing out blood
I will send out a flood
All dat junk
All dat junk
All dat junk
Inside yo trunk
All dat junk
All dat junk
All dat junk
Inside yo trunk
All dat junk
All dat junk
All dat junk
Inside yo trunk
First you in
First you off
First you in
Then you get crunked
I'm coming in to kill you
My brother came to rape you
I found a way to live
Just live right next to you
[Hook]


تا تو هر مجتمع یه کشتار راه بندازیم
مناسب سن لعنتیم رفتار کنم؟ من هشت سالمه، پس بیا خرد شیم
و روز بعد بیدار شیم تو اتاقی که به هم ریخته و همه جا باند زخمه
جاسیگاری شیشه ای خرد شده، و شَمپِین پاشیده روی لامپ ها
ولی این برای بحث نیست، این غیر قابل بحثه
شیدی برای رییس جمهوری، هو
نگذار برگردم به روزای قدیمی
جایی که تو رادیو سواِی و تِک، ال اس دی و دارو زیاد مصرف کرده بودم
تو برنامه وِیکآپ شو  تقریبا خواب رفته بودم
چی بهم میگین احمقا؟ من ناجور زندگی می کردم
تو یهودی ها داشتم جهنم می ساختم وقتی پنلوپ کروز هنوز داشت سینه در می آورد
من و باس مثل یه حیوون مریض قافیه می گذاریم پایین
تو با حرفه ای ها طرفی رفیق، بلاگ نویسای اینترنتی لعنتی
"من همه روز پشت کامپیوترم می شینم و نظر میدم
در مورد همه چیز، من تو همه چیز حرفه ایم، همه چیز بده، آهنگ بعدی رو پخش کن"
شاید اگر از لپ تاپ لعنتیت می پریدم بیرون، احمق خرفت
و با بیگی تا حد مرگ کتکت می زدیم، دِد رانگ می شدم
پسر خدا، مثل چوب تر نرم نیستم، منافذم هیچ وقت بسته نمیشن
این قدر اعتماد به نفس دارم که ازم بخار بلند میشه
آره، آره همه، آروم به چپ، همتون
دور شو وگرنه زیر پا له میشی
به اندازه لیرجِت لعنتیم تجاریم
حسادت به اندازه شیاپِت سبزت کرده
می تونم ببینم مشخصا ناراحتی، رفیق
توجه، توجه، دختر، توجه
وقتی به خونه ی درد من وارد بشی، تو دنیای رنج هستی، پس
بپر بالا، بپر، بپر، اون باسن رو بلرزون
بپر بالا، بپر، با یه آهنگ مورد علاقه طرفدارا اومدم
ولی اگه فکر می کنی برای مربی خیلی بالایی بهتره با دستای لعنتیت بال بزنی
مثل وَن هَلن بپر و برای باد موافق دعا کن
بیشتر از موفقیت می ترسم تا شکست
پس این چی رو بهت میگه؟
که تا حد زیادی هیچ اهمیتی به هیچ چیز نمیدم
مثل استَن که آخرین بسته طرفداریشو پست می کرد
قبلش مستقیم رفت تو مانع کنار جاده
[Outro]
آروم باش، مرد، آروم باش

[Chorus:]
Oh, all around the World
There's an echo
As he takes a bow
And they all know all the girls, the boys
They chase the noise
Through the highs and through the lows
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
They will follow the echo, echo, echo, echo
[Lewis:]
You're a bitch, bitch, bitch, bitch, fucking bitch
I can't stand it, only thing I stand is with my right hand
My bigger finger lingers in the air so understand it
I've flicked the switch! Prick, you're a fucking dick
I demand affection from your clit bitch so slit your wrists
Chew on my a dick then throw up sick, i'ma split your niche
Chop it and put it on a dish full of shit
I'm volitle mind filled up like a hot water bottle ready to throttle yo it get's hotter as I swat her
So listen up bitch i'm on my edge
I'll chew on your neck split your back with a machete
And place you on a rusty rack
Shit you have a disgusting crack, ew you cannot have me back (Yack!)
I've had it with you running off with fucking prick
So cut the whit i'm fucking sick, it's time to pick up and lift
Shit in a cup and wash a dish clean of shit bish
Cuz by this time tomorrow night I would've drained this drain
Empty my mind with the pain, and gain a new rain
Because it's time for no more of your sore shit stupid whore
I'ma find the right person so fuck you'll, you can either watch me or go blind
Take a look into my mind, and rewind
Look at your behind, now re-aline our time fine
I've tried calling you but I must be a mime
Keep ignoring so break a paw pussy i'll chew you up with iron rains whoosy!
I'ma cut the syllables and dribble on these fools like swimming pools!
I hate you, you're fake (Who?)
Why say all this shit and just lie?
I gave you all of my time but I must of been a fucking fly
But fine, I don't need you no more, I ain't giving you no more of mine
Seeing you was a fucking crime, I wasted all my mind
You're a slut with a small but no tits your just another cut
Give me a wound then get it perfumed stinging the more it protrudes
I intrude, but I didn't mean to interrupt your dick sucking, oh tut tut
I'm rude, but fully nude, scared and chard huge!
Let me get through to you that I don't want you yes I liked you
I tried to see through the lies but you just kept them behind the blinds
So drag me on this broken glass ride split me up then run away and try to hide
I'll get Hyde and cover you in molten tar till you're blind! (Now who will scar)
I tried to give you my all but I guess my loyalty and trust to too much for you
I tried to pull you closer the more you ran away whore
But I guess sluts just want more
We're seeing, you meet Dean then, get with him, two weeks after we became apart You must of been getting eaten!
No way was distance was our bittersweeten!
You fell for him and left me on a soggy tissue!
This is my song to you, I hate you, I would love to watch you get grated along with all our memories because they must of all been fake and lies, go with those gorseinon guys, you Maya and Bethany, I couldn't give a fuck about you so fuck the sympathy! Taste my recipe

ççççççççççççç


[Hook]
Cold as ice
(You know that you are!)
Cold as ice
(You know that you are!)
Cold as ice
You're cold as ice to me!
Cold as ice
[Verse 1]
I got you caught up in the raps, yeah
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad, ya
Sweating, but if I'm what you wanted why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's so organic
You can't ignore it so don't just stand before it
Just drop your panties to the floor and skip to cam-cording
Yeah Shorty I told you this was bound to happen
Soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
I was bound to work a number on your back and
Throw your spine out of alignment
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
Just stop at the store and pick a pint up
Let's get a pineapple Schnapps going
No one will knock as long as I hang this sign up
Saying don't disturb, Shorty I'm social bird
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest word?
[Bridge]
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
You're as cold as ice
You're willing to sacrifice our love
[Hook]
Cold as ice
(You know that you are!)
Cold as ice
(You know that you are!)
Cold as ice
You're cold as ice to me!
Cold as ice
[Verse 2]
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuevo
First I kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby you can lay down on the table
But you may want to find something more stable
I told you, I ain't fooling from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying able
I'll make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
From this phony little fishy and sissy fake G's
Skip over the huggy bear and all the kissy-face please
Initiate phase three
Missy now service me
Take another shot of Jager, shaking so nervously
Take your time baby, oh you're the bomb baby
Oh you doing that even better than your mom baby!
I told you I'm Shady
You didn't listen now, did ya?
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with ya
I've got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but I didn't miss ya
I think you're finally starting to get the picture
I'm the American dream and
I'm the definition of white trash balling
I'm right back on 'em with the (chka chka)
I can't call it, same shit, different toilet
Oh, you've got a nice ass, darling!
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin
What you mean we ain't fucking, you take me for a friend?
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
It all started with my father
I must have got my pimping genes from him
The way he left my mama
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Drama
Keep my entourage with me, baby I'll make a promise
There ain't nobody as bomb as me
I'm as calm as the breeze
I'm the bee's knees, his legs, and his arms
I'm a superstar, girl I'm ready for you mama
Why you think the only thing I've got on is my pajamas?


[Intro]
Hm crazy
They say everybody deserve a shot at love
That's bullshit
You live your entire life as a miserable bitch
Then you deserve to die a miserable bitch
Fack you
Good lookin' Em
Jump fast(?)
Trick Trick
[Verse 1: Trick Trick]
Chick(?) to the waitress being me
I frequent the joint so she sees in me
More than an average customer
I trusted her
To bring to me what I ordered
Even a bottle of water
Met her in a (?) grabbed my (?)
All these legs and thighs
That catched my eyes
I got my mind on this five foot one
1-23
I lead her home to go out to see
Her ride the beat without the poles
She don't serve for free
She out for dope
The hustles(?) is clean and respectable
But (???)
But the way she came, whenever I called
Or waved my hand, you gotta understand
This (?) right here, had me gone
I knew(?) one day I drive her home
The day then came that she sat with me
It was a saturday, the club was empty
V.I.P. room, all alone
32 shots of patron
 (Damn!)
I know she gone, she can't drive
Big old(??) (??)
Takes us home, I can't lie
I wanna bone, but I'm to high
Not that I would take advantage of her
Cause I got patience and planning for her
Sunday morning she left my crib
She had to leave to get home to the kids
She rolled with me, spent the night
So why would I believe otherwise
[Hook: Throatslash]
I won't let them hate me (?)
She wanted a baby (?)
She's calling the police
I won't let them take me
She knew I'd fight back
I know she was like that
She scrambled(?) a signature
I swear she ain't write that
The way she was safety(?)
The way she could play me
Boms(?) are closing in, i'm patiently waiting
She offered to pay me
I thought it would ..ay(?) me
Despite what she may be
That woman is crazy
[Verse 2: Trick Trick]
I like the fact that she laid with me
She said she had something to say to me
So much for the layout, so much for the plans
To my surprise, she got a man
Told me she was on her way to breaking up
So the vision of me and her waking up
After making love
Was far from death
The night was young, we laid in the bed
She had to leave to get home to him
Aggravated when I'm her thinking alone with him
She on the phone with him
Touched (?) dog but she's sucking on my lollipop (Damn!)
Can you believe this shit? (What?)
I am leaving this
Cause I can't see her leaving him (hell no)
It's been six months
And all me and her, whatever we did was fuck
And that's whats up
I got me one, but not the one that I'm speaking of
I'm out for love, but not with her
I've found me one that that get me what I'm dreaming of
I told it all out front of her line(?)
She told me no, she needed more time (What?)
I came to gree(?) this falling(?) yet
She keeps seducing me, calling for sex
Starting to pig(?) with a men at home
When all she did was trip when she had my phone
Like:"Who's that?, Who's this?"
Well, who is she to check(?) about another bitch? (What?)
I couldn't take another step further with (That's right)
This ignorance, she had to go
I told her to leave, she told me no
I forced her out, then slammed to door
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Trick Trick]
So whatever this is, it had to stop
I knew for sure that she called the cops (What?)
They came to the door with a:"Knock! Knock! Knock!"
I thought it was her man, so I cocked my Glock
Y'all know me I asked her boat(?)
Damn police, you wouldn't believe what this men told me
Told me he loved to see me go
When all he had was a P.P.O.(?)
Slammed my door, now I'm pissed of about that ho
But that didn't take the cake or change the flight
Thief in the middle of the night
This last (??) Benz
Stole a sim-card and called my friends
Took a picture of her(?) ultra sound
With a note attached:"What you gon' do now?"
Sought me out with my brand new chick
She rode upon me:"Is that your bitch?"
Told me she wanted to kill herself
Eat a shotgun and and kill herself
I passed(?) for gas
Grabbed the .45 from out the stash
If she chase me then that's her ass
You can't catch me in my car too fast
Hold my cash(?), text my phone
Now i'm hurt(?) bitch told the feds
That I got the word(?)
Called my lawyer, checked it out
The alpha bitches(?) outside your house
Now this gon' get you most of all
She asked the judge and she post a bond(?)
On my behave she spoke up
It's 7 AM and I woke up
(coughing)
Man
Pfeww
Hell no
Gotta get my ass up
[Hook]



...

...

(chorus)

Fuck an intro man, lets go..
I come around like what goes around
What goes up must come down
Anyone who comes up must go down
Might as well go for the gusto now
Better not let up, better not let them breath
Last shot give it all you got
Try to turn me down bitch get fucked with a volume knob, fuck all you snobs
Hoes I hope all you rot
2 bottles of lubriderm and a box of condoms is that all you brought?
And you wanna menage a trois you twats
Fuck that I'd rather turn this club to a bar room brawl
Get as rowdy as Roethlisberger in a bathroom stall
Like a leech stuck in a vacuum, yall ain't nuttin but a whole lot of suckin', goin' on in rap
Yeah but I'm home
Bad to the bone
Back in the zone
Let him alone
You don't wanna go eggin' him on
It'll never be my chair that you're on
Crown so tight that it cuts off circulation to the brain no oxygen
Otherwords there's no heir to the throne
When I die so does hip hop
Hitchcock, better shit bitch ass got, a zip locked in a bag
You fags ain't been able to fade me since Kid Rock had a high top
Keep blogging while I'm mind boggling my zone like I'm in the twilight
Talking of my bone this is my mic dog I like hogging it
Flow so wet I'mma take this beat tobogganing
I'm water logging it, I'm sogging it
Pull your verse out the beat and stomp on it
Suplex it on cement like I'm on some straight outta compton shit
Take this dick and chomp on it
I'm so bad I can bitch slap a back handed compliment
Jack ass eat a donkey dick
The game I just about conquered it, like Donkey Kong
I'm bonkers bitch, I'm the king of this honkey shit!
I reign supreme in this honkey shit!
No sense screaming, and arguing
Makes no difference whether a Benz or Bentley or a Beamers the car you in!
You think you ball well I palm it
I throw up bombs when I vomit
Boy I throw down in the kitchen might hit your mom with my omlette
But you got egg on your face now watch me drop an atomic
I should be strapped to the chest of a kamikaze
Bitch I'm as bat shit as Ozzy it's obvious
You can tell I go right off the bat
No pun intended but come any closer I'll bite off your head
Tryna give me the fingers kinda like giving a spider the web
I'm just gonna spin it and try to use it to my advantage
I catch a fly in that bitch you think you fly you just food
I give as much of a flying fuck as that superman dude
Guess I just do what you can't do or make you look stupid and baboozled
Confused as usual and you can get ripped she can open a can too
But you better hope you can handle the heat
Or stay the fuck outta hell's kitchen
I came to cock block like a square fuckin male chicken
Yeah it's shady slut the rest can suck on a big one
Cos Im despicable, like daffy duck when I'm spitting
(haha recovery)

Yo bitch lets switch.HIS PALMS ARE SWEATY, KNEAKS WEAKS, ARMS ARE HEAVY THERES VOMIT ON HIS SWEATER ALREADY.MOMS SPAGGETI HE'S NERVOUS, BUT ON THE SURFACE HE LOOKS CALM AND READY TO DROP BOMBS, BUT HE KEEPS ON FORGGETING WHAT HE WROTE DOWN, THE WHOLE CROWD GO'S SO LOUD HE OPENS HIS MOUTH, BUT THE WORDS DONT COME OUT HE'S CHOKING HOW, EVEYBODY'S JOKING NOW THE CLOCK RUNS OUT, TIMES UP,OVER,BLOAH!!! SNAP BACK TO REALITY, OH THER GOES GRAVITY there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that
Easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
[Hook:]
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo.The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows. It's all over. These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum da dum da da
[Hook]
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail
I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot

[Intro: Eminem]
Ayo, yo, this is motherfucking Eminem... 
Dirty Dozen

Know what I'm saying, word up, bitch motherfuckers better raise up
Y'all motherfuckers better raise up... ayo buss it
[Eminem]
I'm a pitbull terrier, triple darin' ya, scarin' ya with a derringer
Ready to make you wet like a submariner, tearin' ya frame out with homicidal lines
Bringing the drama and the trauma to ya mama's vital signs
A verbal shot fired, this mics been hot wired, uppercuts to your chin knocking your snot skyward
Rappers wanna be screenplay actors, so Im givin them spine fractures
Like linebackers on the Green Bay Packers, an roll over em backwards
Dirty Dozen, Im someone you just dont wanna see like a nerdy cousin
So keep your distance when I get this tense, you see my fist clench
Its gonna be some bullets dispensed,you besta keep yo premescence fixed
Your mistense,any resistance,get you voided like misprints
Youll end up with no teeth left makin a beef threat
When I look up on your set,dont get it twisted like Keith Sweat
[Hook: Eminem]
When I get the bussin', you best be get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin, fool I'm comin through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin', that oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch Im comin through dumpin
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin', you blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you dont know you best make an assumption, I got you slumpin'
Fool I'm comin' through dumpin'
[Proof]
A proven fact my pact got your whole team movin' back
We never losin slack, I paid dues in rap
I'm runnin 'til my shoes are tapped
My writers use them gats, my thugs fuse them cracks
Relax an catch a contact, to an amusin track, slugs dispatched
Slugs dispatch, on any street riz and mismatch
My teamll get busy like rednecks on some 6 packs
My fist crack the featherweight, my wordsll never break
A clever snakell be forever fake, let me get this cheddar straight
Makin dough is a part, so is the heart, my flow is the art
Me an the mic Gomez like Lois & Clark
Weapons concealed until death, now see em, my chrome shatter bones that lack calcium
Knockin domes out the ballpark, your dawgs is all bark, plus you got a small heart
Now save them corny lines for Hallmark
I wanna the sunny days & money paid in they figures
A microphone fiend an on my own team theres fake niggas
Mums they rocked the cradle, I spot the fable
They made the shop an stable, with grass top the table
The Glock enable when I pop the fatal, phonies that I plot prenatal wax
The player haters never make it back
Im dumpin'
[Hook: Eminem]
When I get the bussin', you best be get to jumpin'
I'm touchin' somethin, fool I'm comin through dumpin'
My beat's bumpin', you hear it thumpin', that oughta tell you somethin'
Bitch Im comin through dumpin
Bullets hit you, your heart stops pumpin', you blood starts clumpin'
I'm comin' through dumpin'
If you dont know you best make an assumption, I got you slumpin'
Fool I'm comin' through dumpin'
[B-Flat]
Aiyo we don't say that, we say it's real business
The third nigga on the mic, representing world'afanompolous
Ain't shit stoppin us, old school like cold crush
Slicing dice, emcee's on the mic like cold cuts
Blaw make the record, coming straight from the get (oh)
Where niggas keep it real, n make these skills pay there dedts
I can't forget the DJ he'll play we say, focus on the shit that make the crowd wanna flip
We don't bust clips cause it's not in us, but when shit get deep it's a must that we bust
Arm n leg, leg, arm n head, for afros and facing bone heads always down to the dreads
40's to drink endos to smoke, n the rims that we ride on is true deez spokes
Tires, know alot of micheals but they don't live on myers
Bitches pussy tight, here come the dick flyers
What's my name? homie sire
Gon ride on the mic like titty dances on the fire
[Hook: B-Flat]
When you hear my beat, see the crowd starts jumpin, yee, ha-ha-ha yee I'm comin threw dumpin' (word)
Other emcees like dougie fresh ain't saying nuthing, bitch nigga I'm comin threw dumpin'
Go to the church n have the dick n cold humpin, word up, I'm comin threw dumpin'
[Eye-Kyu]
When I'm lifted don't quizz this, it ain't worth it to risk it
I quick with the gift, n twice as swift with the biscuit
Headed back to ship off all the niggas ass around christmas
They know it's the time of year, they be expecting my visits
Doin 90 on the henzel, runnin to get it, n twizt u niggas like a pretzel
Blows come in three like the godfather trilogy, I'm micheal koleown with this mic, bitch u ain't killin me
Let me see some hands to make sure y'all feeling me
I'm stickin you up for your rocks and y'all gon give em up wilingly
Rap is my life n that's why every day I live it, punches holes in the floor
Like wack rappers records, man every nigga in here is bringin in drama this big
Then they time to come up shorter then bloods all midgits, shiiiit
[Hook: Eye Kyu]
Can you dig it, kyu coming threw with something
Guarentee to make ya whole fuckin block jumpin' comin threw dumpin'
When we come, we got your knees cumblin, y'all niggas ain't sayin nothing
Cause we comin dumpin'
What you talkin? nigga get to walkin, see your bitch ass crew walkin, we gon get to dumpin'
You don't want it, while headin back up off it, I'm a tell you how it is, nigga cause we dumpin'


[Verse 1]
Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch
[Bridge]
Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long
[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, shake your body
[Verse 2]
Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes just being fresh laced
So I guess it ain't
Dead after shave of cologne that made him just faint
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint
So if love is a chess game, check mate
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how
At least I know that I don't know
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid
Hope so, now ho...
[Bridge]
[Hook]
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody, get your vials
[Scratches]
[Verse 3]
They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note!
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn't everybody know
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur's Cargo's
Girl you're fixin' to get your heart broke, don't be absurd man
You bird brained baby I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman
Unless you're a swallow
Word, w-word man you heard, but don't be discouraged girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

[Introduction]
Yeah...
It's my life...
My own words I guess...
[Verse 1]
Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?
When they know they're your heart
And you know you were their armour
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?
And everything you stand for, turns on you to spite you?
What happens when you become the main source of her pain?
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy
Daddy's writing a song, this song ain't gonna write itself
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself
Then turn right around in that song and tell her you love her
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
[Verse 2]
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying"
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time
But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it
"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket
It's got a picture, "This'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror
These fuckin' walls must be talking, cuz man I can hear 'em
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight
Now go out there and show 'em that you love 'em before it's too late
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door
It turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on
And I'm singing...
[Chorus]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...
[Verse 3]
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing
"Daddy it's me, Help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding"
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?
"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"
"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone"
But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice
"Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"
That's what they want, they want you Marshall
They keep.. screamin' your name
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it
Put it to my brain, scream "Die Shady!" and pop it
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was
Supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'
It's spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk right up to Kim and kiss her
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister
Almost as if to say
[Clannad:]
Nakayoshi dango te o tsunagi ooki na marui wa ni naru yo
Machi o tsukuri dango hoshi no ue minna de waraiau yo
Usagi mo sora de te o futte miteru dekkai o-tsuki-sama
Ureshii koto kanashii koto mo zenbu marumete
Dango dango dango dango dango dango daikazoku
Dango dango dango dango dango daikazoku
Dango dango dango dango dango dango daikazoku
Dango dango dango dango dango daikazoku
[Chorus/Outro]
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back
And when I'm gone, just carry on, don't mourn
Rejoice every time you hear the sound of my voice
Just know that I'm looking down on you smiling
And I didn't feel a thing, So baby don't feel no pain
Just smile back...

[Eminem]
Statlanta!
Welcome, as we introduce to you
The newest member of the Shady/Aftermath family
As we take you on a journey
Down South to the dirty dirty
Put yo' hands in the air
For A-T-L's own, Stat Quo!
Are you ready?!
Ten, nine, eight, seven
Six, five, four, three
Two, one, on your, mark
Ready, get, set, let's, GO!
[Stat Quo]
Check it out, stand up
It's your boy Stat Quo representin that Shady/Aftermath
GMM's the squad, I'm the LeBron James of this thang
And right now, you get ready to bear witness
To the "Street Status" mixtape {*echoes*}

[Intro]
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one
Now some of you might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
[Verse 1]
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
Cause ain't no way I'mma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'mma do something I do it, I don't give a damn
What you think, I'm doing this for me, so fuck the world
Feed it beans, it's gassed up, if it thinks it's stopping me
I'mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me I'm tearing down your balcony
No if ands or buts don't try to ask him why or how can he
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shitting
Whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a "fuck you" for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he's got the urge
To pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
[Hook]
I'm not afraid to take a stand
Everybody come take my hand
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
[Verse 2]
Ok quit playin' with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words
In the rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your feelings
Instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh”
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
Relax, I ain't going back to that now
All I'm tryna say is get back, click-clack BLAOW
Cause I ain't playin' around
There's a game called circle and I don't know how
I'm way too up to back down
But I think I'm still trying to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons
These motherfuckers are doing jumping jacks now
[Hook]
[Bridge]
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'mma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'mma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Time to put my life back together right now
[Verse 3]
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I have been through the wringer, but they can do little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead
No more beef lingers, no more drama from now on, I promise
To focus solely on handling my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof
Like my daughters and raise it
You couldn't lift a single shingle on it
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and...
[Hook]

Everybody, I'm Eminem. I'm right here in New York
Right now on the Shade 45
Sirius Satellite Radio station
We've got DJ Whoo Kid in the house!
And we're 'bout to get into some questions that my fans have asked and.
.
.
And one of me to explain
So uhm... one of the first questions that my fans have asked is... uhm:
"Why does Whoo Kid have so much exclusive shit?"
That was the biggest question!
Crazy lllmatic Macadoshis exclusives


Verse 1
I'm sick, somewhere I must of caught diseases
From Marshall cause for some reason I just can't stop succeedin'
Its partially from being lost at sea
Feeling like I can walk with ease while even being part palegic
I'm the philosophies prodigy of prophecy like Socrates
A lot to see like world renowned soccer teams
You're probably not following, so I soul heartily
Swear weak is not me, when you think great
Well ya thought of me
Its seems I came into a world in atrocity and possibly
I've subconsciously thought I'd stop some policies
That let our politics and politicians start to cop our things
The war on drugs is to put the only dealers in the pharmacies
Apart from the hypotheses, a skill like carpentry or botany
Is probably the most valuable thing like property!
Trust me, I'm honest constantly. Pardon me
I'm just lost for words and paused perturb, my apologies
But I'll still sing
Hook
Be da bop x4
This needs to stop, this need or thought that lets the people to be beat by cops
Its almost like no matter what they couldn't give a shit if we're pleased or not
As useless as tooth less shark, prove that you can have a new fresh start
Be da bop x4
At three my moms would read some awful story about how to beat the odds
I've tried to be the man that she could look up at and see in stars
But now I bet she looks down on me ever since I've seized this art
Verse 2
My childhood was something more like now you should
Stay in the shallow pool of life like the way a coward would
Had to make myself strong like pallet wood
Cause the weight of the world is heavy I'm finna break this stool
Oh well, only one carrying it so I guess I look a fool
Mistook for cool one of the worn out old rusty useless tools
Do you know how it feels being told yous a fool
Cause you're always tryna find a way everybody's beautiful?
I used to get ridiculed for thinking wearing suits was cool
Almost every time I've been told, "That life don't suit ya, Jules!"
And I'm smart as fuck but I've been told by useless fools
That if I follow the money it'll make me completely whole
Whatever, anything anyone else has done good I've done better
But some'll tell ya, at sixteen my wits were intensely swift
Picked a bit til I could hit me licks
Try to stick it in the pretty chicks
But they're harder than Mayweather reading Harry Potter sentences
I'm barely an adult and I've managed well enough
Haven't landed in the cut or been bandaged for more than cuts
Grasped a silver tongue and still as candid as a blunt
The way I compare to the rest is like a commander to his grunts
Why is supposedly the only way to be successful is through college degrees
Man, that bothers me. I sought harmony and fought for me
Pardon me I lost my train of thought, my apologies
But I'll just sing
Hook
Be da bop x4
At three my moms would read some awful story about how to beat the odds
I've tried to be the man that she could look up at and see in stars
But now I bet she looks down on me ever since I've seized this art
Be da bop x4
Money's the real schedule one drug we all can't seem to stop
The only ones to pay to live on this planet like we can leave this rock
This needs to stop. I'll fight until I bleed out or drop
Verse 3
Currently, its common courtesy to repay with  cotton currency
That is tainted and that's our biggest problem certainly
I think the world would be better off if
Everyone started burning green instead of dreams, its hurting me
We murder teens by making them serve over seas turned burgundy
For personal greed and tell them is in the country's needs
How much longer til we open our eyes and fucking see!?
That the human race as a whole is crumbling
All because of the fruit that's grown off of money trees
But if we all don't get our heads up out our ass
We could end up stumbling down a path
Of brash thinking on fast ways we can be cash making
Over the laughs made with bad ass friends 'n I can't stop it
Even though I'm trying to be the man God is!
But still through all this constant nonsense
What's hardest is the garbage that gets our 1 Percenter's pardoned
If pro is the opposite of con, then what's the opposite of progress?
This pompous economic market's causing profit for the gossip columns
And this life is all we know, and that's where we got a problem
I'm not trying to reiterate Nas or Rakim
But we should stop the violence over petty shit like rocks n diamonds
I can already picture my son, even though I'm not a father
Lost in all the product our father's brought down on us
To piece through all their squabbles over profit
No matter how inhumane it got to be. I've sought harmony
And fought for me, pardon me I've lost my train of thought, my apologies
Hook
Be da bop x4
Money's the real schedule one drug we all can't seem to stop
The only ones to pay to live on this planet like we can leave this rock
This needs to stop. I'll fight until I bleed out or drop
Be da bop x4
Its almost like no matter what they couldn't give a shit if we're pleased or not
This needs to stop. I'll fight until I bleed out or drop

"Poor Boy"
One day in my life
When i forgot about old tragedy
Just thought about my hummy & family
No one can make me sad there
Http://apaantuh.com
The stranger comes with light
In beatiful place to ask & cry
You face writen by so much worries
I just wanna swipe your mistake
But i'm traped on the walls
I tried in many times
After myself was broken in many times
I woke up in wrong place
She's hate me
She's just want him
Love him again
Kiss him again
Throw me to trash
With all my sign of happiness
Then she give me a good bye gift
She leaves me cursed in my heart
I dont wanna fallin in love with my ex again
But i always dream about her after that
Http://ihsanmagazine.blg.lt
I know why....yeah
Because i'm poor boy, yeah
I just poor boy,i just ugly,and i just dummy fools
But thank you for all

In the end, my hummi and family catch me
Keep me in their mystique love
But thank you for all
I very happy
Wow i very excited with your post!! i thing this is about something like i never could to happen but i really

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Now I can make it happen
My rappin' is similar to mothafuckers when they scrappin'
Blast and watch em' back up
Notorious biggie killer, affiliation with death row
Niggas get their caps pealed back, fool this the west coast
Fuck ah misdemeanor I'm raisin hell like felonies
Mr. Makaveli straight outta jail to sellin' these
Intoxicated we duplicated but never faded
Now that we made it my adversaries is player hatin'
Got a Mercedes for these tricks, that thought I quit
Then got a drop top Jag for these bitches that's on my dick
Go to a club in a pack, I'm smokin' bud in the back
I wait for niggas to trip, cause bitch I love to scrap
Now mama raised me as a thug nigga, with love niggas
I'm a millionaire started as a drug dealer
I went from rocks to zines, writing raps and movies
I went from trustin' these tricks now they all want to sue me
So fuck em' all
[Hook]
I'm on my knees beggin' please come save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy
Everybody run for cover, aw shit
Thug life motherfucker, duck quick
I'm on my knees beggin' please come save me
The whole world done made a nigga crazy
And when I saw it on the news I see busta girl killin 'Tasha
Now I'm screaming fuck the world
[Verse 2: Eminem]
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it
And spit it back in the faces of you racists
And hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you Nazis
Watch me, cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed as you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise them cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me I'm makin' them go crazy
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me
And you fugazi if you think Ima admit wrong
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sicked on
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Hopsin]
Now may I kick a lil' flow for y’all
That’s slow and raw
For niggas who thinking the west coast fell off
But first, I’d like to give a little toast to all
Who’s souls was lost up in the rap flows in all (gee)
Back to my original topic
Fuck the bullshit you should be getting with Hopsin
On that real rap shit man forget the imposters
Y’all destroyed hip hop (good) Mission accomplished
Now Ima make them regret this shit
Bringing back all the elements
Making these fellas swell up
And tell them that fucking hell is hit
I got to focus though
And come down on all my zoning's yo
Because I’m prone to blow
And destroy all my lyric chromosomes
I told you folks that it’s over
So go and roll up your soldiers
And be up out this bitch like hocus pocus
I’m so ferocious I had the potion but no one noticed
And now I’m about to blow up even bigger than my nose is

Yea, yea, we back again, we doin' our shit, yo
Word up, I wanna hear some fly shit
You know what I'm sayin', some get high shit
Word up, I wanna hear some white boy shit, man
Yo, I wanna hear some Eminem, man
Talkin' about all that shit he be doin'
You ain't into fuckin' drugs, fuck you
You don't do ecstasy, fuck you
You don't pop mushrooms, fuck you
If you don't wanna tab of acid, fuck you
I'm Nauseous in this place, I need some office
The boss is late, I wanna slap the mustache right off his face
I'm ready to go postal, I'm so close
I can feel his throat with no pulse when I choke him
In ten seconds I'm go in to turn into Hulk Hogan
With a cigarette in his mouth
He tell me there's no smokin'
I'm sick of this shit, it's ridiculous
All I picture is kickin' his ass
When he's taken his ashes and flickin' 'em
I'm sick of these stamps
I'm sick of lickin' 'em, sick of stickin' 'em
I'm sick of lookin' at 'em, I'm sick of 'em
Aight Mr. Mathers pick 'em up
No you pick 'em, bitch, stick 'em up
Get against the wall, senior citizens and all
I can't take this shit no more, everybody hit the floor
Get the door, close it and lock it
Put your wallets back in your pocket, I don't want dollars
Ain't none of us walkin' out of this office
Fagget, fuck you, work at the post office, fuck you
Talkin' shit to me, tellin' me to take out
The goddamn garbage, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' dick, fuck you
If you're a white rapper, fuck you
Talk shit about stretch your cool
But if you don't talk shit about stretch, fuck you
If you're a fuckin' punk, fuck you
Talk shit about me, fuck you
You wanna battle me, fuck you
I ain't got to say shit to you but fuck you

I thought I would make a Spotify playlist made of the songs G has created samples from in the past. Not all of the songs are on the playlist due to Availability on Spotify but all I could find are there

I have a cock dangling from my head

Instead of that cock slap feeling i get splinters in my jeb
Pull them out with tweasers and go for a crap

Eminem is black

[Verse 1: Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah
[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
[Verse 2:EGW]
Dear Mom
I know we've had our fair shair of fights
But I don't go to sleep without thinkin of you atleast once a night
Because of all the things we used to do together
And all the homes we had to lose together
The way you were treated, it ain't an excuse
I didn't grow up like others, But you'll have to excuse
My poor behavior I'm lost
I didn't think there would be a cost
Or a toll, and the fact you couldn't control
The outcome of your relationships
All those men, they were fuckin shits
Pretty smelly, if you ask me
They didn't deserve you, they were unworthy
I see you got a man who will treat you right
Thats good, but he fucks up and he'll meet my right
Cause you're beautiful, and deserve someone who will treat you like a queen
The way I've been acting, I know I've been obscene
Thats why i had to go, this direction is where the wind blowed
And I know, That you were dying inside while you signed those papers
And the expression when i said "Bye Ma, See you later"
That said it all, But I still love you
And It hurts when i don't hear a I love you too
But, I know you're in pain
Because your son mentally insane
But forgive me ma this once
Because this silence is too fuckin much
[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
[Verse 2: EGW]
But it'll never change the fact
That if you died I'd have a heart attack
Cause your my # 1 and I was yours too
Even though i acted wrong, just give me a clue
As too how long ago I was just like you
Doing stupid things cause it was cool
And you werent tryin to impress as many people as i was
But you still did it, regardless
Just take a look inside and realize
That underneath these blue eyes
Is a boy that can't find
A place to stay,too many homes
I traveled worldwide, next day we're gone
I don't blame you, I blame me
I could never get along with your hubby
And if life is a timebomb
I still question why mine hasn't gone off
But i'm out
Dont think i dont care
Cause that just ain't fair
[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far
[Verse 3: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

Hear em callin:
I hear them calling me
My ear's aren't deceived tho
Im paranoid from the weed
Fucking extremely stoned
Barely speakin' without the stutter
The Blurry red and blue
Lights from behind
Smash the line
Thrash my ride
Need to get outta sight
I own two strikes
Under-going a third
If I can't provide and answer
For my high!
Lookin' eyes
Need to find a vice
Before stoppin' this ride
Debatin'
Hittin' over overdrive
Thinkin' 'bout
Racin' the piggy
Ch-ch-checkin' 
On the fuel gauge
While the car is revvin'
See it drainin'
Lookin' like its leakin'
It's enragin'
But it's that happen
When ur speedin' 
Like a high!
...speed demon..
Absolutely no gas left
No juice, to boost
No where left, too cruise
Everything to lose
Time to face the music
Pulled over now
I'm stressin'
Meltin' a fuse
One last tast
Before return'
To my quest
Swint as if
I'm starrin'
At zues's lightin' bolt
Just try explain I'd been theift
Of sleep
No abuse
Didn't get accused
Nothin' from my past
He leaves, a sigh of relief
Feelin' blessed
This didn't end
With me been subclassed
He took off first
And I waited n left, last
Can't believe
He didn't question my mask
Or my potent  high!
Musk
Not from the exhaust
I thought, I was toast
This was way too close
I'm glad
I didn't do like most
And dose..

Shit, basically they're just playing sick
They ain't shit, they ain't saying shit, spray em 50
A to the K get in the way I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fucking mayhem, you staying with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not trying to confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I getting through to you?
You know what's coming, you motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put ya life in this, nothing like surviving a shot

Nothin' high class in my glass, only bottles I pop
Are bottles of pop so when I pop up in the spot
Im prob-ably not gonna be wantin' to pop bubbly
Or Ciroc, I'm not Puffy, but I'mma run this city tonight
When I hit it, I might act like a frickin' idiot
Diddy mixed with a medieval knight, big city lights
Little indignity, hot diggity, this Biggie is getting me hype
I don't get some liquor, I'll hurt you
I'll knock a dick in the dirt, bickerin' worse
Than that bitch in that Snickers commercial
A mixture of Stiffler and Urkel, hangin' from the light fixture
I hope you pricks are insured for this buildin'
Cuz we're tearin' it down, security get out

I swear the only thing I hear is the sound
Of sirens goin' AH AH AH AH cause...

[Intro: Karim Kaloga (Brook Gima)]
The Deekestrelz boy. Micheal Jackson died protecting us
We need to keep ourselves alive, or it was for nothing
Okay, we're all in this together, Brook, Come on (I want him back)
I know, I know. Brook,  We're gonna stay alive we're gonna get out of this we're gonna get out of these woods we're gonna find the police and we're gonna make sure those mothafucks are punished for this, Okay

[Godfrey]
Oh no, an overused slang term for sexually inappropriate
Or perverted or for attempting to derive
Sexual gratification through dishonorable means
Unfortunately, the word has become an abused
Deekestrelz, favorite of melodramatic people
Who try hard to use the word
Wherever possible, to the point
Of rendering the word almost
Meaningless I hate that really
Creepy guy who keeps trying to dance
With me, Last night Vic was acting
Creepy, constantly checking his watch and muttering
Something about solar energy about it
Rather than Person a accepting she usually has
Unreasonable insecurities with regards to Person B
She labels person B as "creepy" without home of dark and the scared
[Eminem]
The fact that she is the actual one with the problem
Screaming like "That guy is really creepy!"
A man who is honest about wanting
To get in a girl's panties, oh my god, that creep
Totally just told me that he want to have
Sex with me, he must be such a dick
A word girls use to describe usually well intentioned
Guys who haven't the slightest clue about how to interact
With females without scaring the fuck out of them
Guy: "So I wrote you this poem about how much I love you."
Girl: "Who the hell are you, anyway?"
Guy: "Oh, right. I'm Craig. I've been watching you with binoculars from the bushes for the last 2 months now"
Girl: "Whoah, that's kinda creepy. Get the fuck away from me."
Guy: "But I love you! Why can't you see that?!"
What white people will call you if you breach
Their insular definition of acceptable behavior
Love letters are creepy
A person who's behavior
Eminem, Deekestrelz, home of dark and the scared

He risk of cardiovascular, bang bang bang disease increases
Progressively above 115/75
MM-HG, in the past, hypertension
Was only diagnosed if secondary signs of high
Arterial pressure were present
Along with a prolonged high systolic
Oressure reading over several visits
Regarding hypotension, in practice
A slang term to describe a person who displays
Actions to that of a rapist
Serial killer, or pedophile, by far the blood pressure is considered
Too low only if noticeable
I get outta here to wrong turn
Home of dark and the scared are present

Yo check this out! In life, you got your want to be's
You got your going to be's, and you got your has been's

Oh a line with fakes a time
Fresh time, with sure more times
Jimminy two time respect mine
Big click with breakfast and blacklist
War! War! War! War!
Vision, knocking you out motherfucker listen
Superstition can help you in this battle
G's and sandles who surround you in all the angles
All over your shit in shamble
Looking the little of latter you fucking runt
[Hook 4x]
Hustlers! Hustlers and Hardcore!
Giving you more than what you asking for!

Danger hander
Banging swinging banner all single hander
Hit the left propaganda
Ill manner bad grammar stander
Got the people chasing with cameras by the manner
Hit and slap us, so pajamas
Hiding under clothes in dirty hampers
Happy brands will make them happy campers
Little laughter
Shit nappers
[Eminem]
I'll puke eat and freak you
Battle, I'm too weeded to speak to
The only key that I see to defeat you
Would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you
And force feed you them both and on each feet is a cleat shoe
I lift you off your feet so fast with a round house
You'll think I pulled the fucking ground out from underneath you
I ain't no fucking g, I'm a canibal
I ain't trying to shoot you, I'm trying to chop you into pieces and eat you
Rap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass
And have you with open gashes, strapped to a soakin matress
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers
Fuck the planet until it spins on a broken axis

[Intro: Busta Rhymes] (Eminem)
Yeah! Guess who it is!
Aiyyo Dre! I think they in trouble! (WOO!!!)
Scott Storch! Why you have to do it like this to them?!
Feels like a new day
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes] (Eminem)
Listen, now every time I come and I hit you niggas with shit regardless
You get retarded and then the niggas ain't got a clue
On how the fuck I do what I do and say what I say
And spit what I spit you ain't never even gotta question who
Cause you know that I'm the only nigga that can ever come
And spitefully turn the place in to a motherfuckin zoo
Then I come and I spit all crazy sh-sh-sh-shit
And m-m-m-make n-n-niggas do exactly what I want 'em to
From my point of view instead of trying to step up
You still trying to play catch up and keep up with the way a nigga grew
These niggas panick and freakin get schizophrenic and let they emotions out
And I doubt they can ever test my crew
Take a second check it I wreckon my records are better than
Whatever record you recorded that's why ya shit is through (WOO!!!)
You fuckin idiot I don't think you get it
I'm one of the greatest ever period every syllable is true
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll
[Verse 2: Eminem]
Shit on a mic and do do, my doo-doo
You do not have a fightin chance to move you you were covered in my poo-poo
Smothered in my manure while I spit saliva fluid do-do-do-do-do-do
G-g-g-goobers secluded you
You don't have a clue as to what we're about to do do you
So just sit back and watch somethin you just gon have an a-chew
You just made me sneeze I'm allergic to beats like these
Please excuse me my allergies are actin up thanks a lot Scott
Your probably wonderin why there's thunderin everyone
Is runnin and duckin up under everything up on the block
Cause Bus a Bus and Flipmode just tip toed into the club
With shady quietly tryin not to start up a riot with Doc
But since we always started we might as well have a party
So gather 'round everybody come on lets get our drink on
And you ain't got to do nothin special for this occasion
Just reach in the closet put somethin on and get to the club
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll
[Verse 3: Busta Rhymes]
Catch you niggas and snatch you niggas you bunch of bumblin fools
Who got me rumblin dudes all way down the block
Keep on stumblin and jumblin over their words and vowels
Throw in the towel see you niggas is on the clock
And you runnin out of time see I'm tired of all y'all
M-m-m-mumblin-m-m-mumblin n-n-nigga I got it locked
Every single time you put my shit in your cd player and turn up the volume
You bang your head because your shit is not
I - continue with crumblin niggas and tumblin niggas
You struggle while I humble a nigga with the Glock
Then I watch you while I'll keep on fumblin while I got you tr-tr-tremblin
For one of my niggas bust ya head with a rock
Before I start to do another thing then to make you crown me the king
With such a butter swing nigga follow the flock
Now watch my brotha bring all my diamonds to summer bling
While I'm climbin and fuck her then tell you bitch to get off my yacht
[Chorus: Busta Rhymes]
Now if you ain't runnin you ain't handicappin your vision
I think it's simple enough think that it's really plain to see
No matter how much you try, no matter how much you make an effort
You niggas can never ever really fuck with me
Cause I'll hurt you, and I will learn you a thing or two
And I'll hurt you, and I'll finish your career for you, I'll

[Chorus: Eminem]
Didn't use to have to
Primetime, yeah this is my time to shine
This is the time that's mine
But you pricks took it away & now it's gone, but not for long
Cause I'm coming back strong
Gun in hand, shield on my arm
I'm a hurricane, yeah I'm a hurricane
Don't fuck with me cause I'm a hurricane
And I'm coming back, yeah, I'm coming back, yeah, I'm coming back
[Verse 1: Eminem]

Ayo, my pen and paper cause a chain reaction
To get your brain relaxing, a zany acting maniac in action
A brainiac in fact son, you mainly lack attraction
You look insanely whack when just a fraction of my tracks run
My rhyming skills got you climbing hills
I travel through your mind into your spine like siren drills
I'm sliming grills of roaches, with sprayed on disinfectants
Twist the necks of rappers 'til their spinal column disconnects
We disinfect then check the monologue, turn your system up
Twist them up, and indulge in the marijuana smog
This is the season for noise pollution contamination
Examination of more cartoons than animation
My lamination of narration
Hit's a snare and bass of track fucked up rapper interrogation
When I declare invasion, there ain't no time to be stare and gazing
I turn the stage into a barren wasteland...
I'm Infinite
[Chorus:]
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
[Verse 2:]
Bust it, I let the beat commence so I can beat the sense of your elite defense
I got some meat to mince, a crew to stomp and two feet to rinse
I greet the gents and ladies, I spoil loyal fans
I foil plans and leave fluids leaking like oil pans
My coil hands around this microphone are lethal
One thought in my cerebral is deeper then a Jeep full of people
MC's are feeble, I came to cause some pandemonium
Battle a band of phony MC's and stand the lonely one
Imitator, Intimidator, Stimulator, Simulator of data, Eliminator
There's never been a greater since the burial of Jesus
Fuck around and catch all of the venereal diseases
My thesis will smash a stereo to pieces
My accapella releases classic masterpieces through telekinesis
And eases you mentally, gently, sentimentally, instrumentally
With entity, dementedly meant to be Infinite
[Chorus:]
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
[Verse 3:]
Man I got evidence I'm never dense and I been clever ever since
My residence was hesitant to do some shit that represents the M-O
So I'm assuming all responsibility
Cause there's a monster will in me that always wants to kill MC's
Mic messaler, slamming like a wrestler
Here to make a mess of a lyric smuggling embezzler
No one is specialer, My skill is intergalactical
I get cynical act a fool then I send a crew back to school
I never packed a tool or acted cool, it wasn't practical
I'd rather let a tactical, tact full track tickle your fancy
In fact I can't see, or can't imagine
A man who ain't a lover of beats or a fan of scratching
This is for my family, the kid who had a cameo on my last jam
Plus the man who never had a plan B
Be all you can be, cause once you make an instant hit
I'm tensed a bit and tempted when I see the sins my friends commit...
I'm Infinite
[Chorus:]
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite
You heard of hell well I was sent from it
I went to it serving a sentence for murderin' instruments
Now I'm trying to repent from it
But when I hear the beat I'm tempted to make another attempt at it...
I'm Infinite

In everyone's own opinion is rap god a good song or do you think Eminem could have done better???

My name is Johnathan Rhee
I'm 6 foot three
I live in a tree
Just like a chimpanzee
I'll shoot a three
And make it nicely
I just hit my knee
On a piece of debris
I'm so fast you can't see
You just wish you were me
Cause I'm Johnathan Rhee
Nigga


[verse 1: Eminem]
You've been patiently waiting
To make it through all the hate
Debating whether or not
You can even weather the storm
As you lay on the table
They operating to save you
It's like an 
Angel
 came to you
They think they're crazy but they ain't crazy lets face it, shit basically
They just playin sick, they ain't shit They ain't sayin shit.. spray'em Fifty
A to the K, get in the way I'll bring Dre and them wit me
And turn this day into fuckin mayhem you stayin wit me?
Dont let me lose you, Im not tryin to confuse you
When I let loose with this uzi and just shoot through your Izuzu
You get the message am I gettin through to you?
You know whatz comin you motherfuckerz dont even know do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix them up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killaz tied up in a knot
The Jugganautz of this rap shit like it or not
Its like a fight to the top just to see who died for the spot
You put your life in this - nothin like survivin the shot
Y'all know what time it iz az soon az Fifty signz on this dot
Shit what you know about death threats, cuz I get alot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (50 Cent: woo)- nuclear shower
Theres nothin spookier, you're now about to witness the power of
[verse 2: Eminem]
It's like a throne that he dont even own
He won't sit down, given the crown he just throws it around
It's like a joke he's like a king, but he dont rule a thing
He dont want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry
He dont want the fame dont want the lute he's in this for a sport
Runnin circles with the competition on the court
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it
And you can't love it you can hate it but you can't ignore it
You can't be that ignorant but you can try to sell him short
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it
And he was gonna raise hell like them country boys
And if I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it
[Chorus - Nate Dogg]
This Is The Story Of A Warrior I Kno U Kno It
Tru Warrior Go Ahead Make Some Noise
It ain't healthy To Be Makin Niggas Paranoid
Hit Your Corner With my weapon I Dont Need My Boyz
Im Doin 120 On The Fast Lane
Kick Back Just Relax Let Me Do My Thang
Dont Give a Fuck About You Suckas Gotta Maintain
Money Power And Respect In This Rap Game
[verse 3: Eminem]
Entertainment is changin', intertwinin' with gangsta's
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum
Holy or unholy, only have one homie
Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate, I guess words are a
Mothafucka they can be great
Or they can degrade, or even worse they can teach hate
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make
Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you
To get they hands on every dime you have, they want you to lose your mind
Every time you mad
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me, strictly just to get me off
Of these streets quickly
But all they kids be listenin' to me religiously, so i'm signin' cd's while
Police fingerprint me
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesn't make sense Pete
It's all political, if my music is literal, and i'm a criminal how the fuck
Can I raise a little girl
I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to, you're full of shit too, Guerrera, that
Was a fist that hit you...

[Judicious]
I hate my life, can’t wait to make it right
I’m aching to get back to me so I can take it straight to Christ
I’m on top of the world, I’m baked the lakes look nice
Hit a great bong, vacate it’ll take you flights
And it hits nice, just wait til you break the ice
Depression sucks, suicidal it’ll stay for life
I can’t rest unless I aim the blade and scrape the knife
Pressure on the vein, blood sprays and fate was right
He’d take his life, wake up and rape his wife
Realize he wasn’t sleeping, take a shot and make it twice
Sipping liquor while gazing at his naked wife
Dead lays the lady who had his children gave them life
I’m too depressed, grab my throat said screw the breath
Choked passed out, fell to hell and ooh there’s death
He said you will never lose this stress
So move it, guess what we got you doing next
You gotta prove the rest of us
That your loose screws are the best of us
My loose screws are too loose for you to re noose ooh, re juice
My brain is racing it’s like I’m better aching for medication
While I’m pacing around patiently waiting for my sedation
Cuz I tasted the perks, grabbed the pill bottle and scraped it
I’m wasted off 3 pills, an eighth of laced weed and a case I faced for me
I’ll rape this beat, take the condom and staple it to your feet
And mark my place that I came for my defeat
Ain’t no way you crazy like me
Insane as he, looks plain but maybe there’s a way he
Can hang with Shady, we crazy, and can say fuck all you who hate me

[Hook - Minime]
Yeah, I want to know that I can be sure
I don't want to live this life no more
I want everything to be okay
From now on, hey yeah, hey yeah
[Verse 1 - Big Beat]
Yeah, if only Mondays were great
If only if I had someone else to date
I just gotta know if it's okay to stay
That is what I wonder every day
I sing this song for you to see
We could have been friends, yeah, you and me
So if you look in your fate
What do you see?
[Pre-Hook - Minime]
I see everything going bad
I wish I was still living with Mum and Dad
Living young for long, now living old
That is because
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Big Beat]
I see that can still be hard to learn
You don't get a lot of breaks or earn
I suffer from it, now it is your turn
So what do you see?
[Pre-Hook]
[Hook]
[Bridge - Minime]
Ooh ooh, I got lost in stress
Ooh ooh, I got in a mess
[Verse 3 - Eminem]
So when you were having trouble sleeping in bed
I was spending ages giving little b**ches head
I just want to turn my life around
But I think everything is out of bound
I just want more s**t and more paper
I spend ages looking for my waiter
It doesn't matter if I'm up all night
No, I don't Get Lucky, I'm not alright
[Hook]
[Outro - Minime]
All I ever do for you
Is still not enough
Living this life forever
Is going to be tough

Just G-OD'd

[Intro - Diddy]
People tell me that I should go life a better f**king life
People tell me that I should go life a better f**king life
People tell me that I should go life a better f**king life
And your f**king ears get blown when I shout this out f**king twice!
[Hook 1 - Eminem (Twista)]
I don't understand why
You would wanna leave me (Oh no)
I just wanna know why
I lost everything I had (The fate is the limit)
This s**t continues whilst I lose my breath (And faith is the truth)
If you want me, take a step
Take a step closer to me or Lay Down now
[Verse 1 - Miss Cypra]
First class first blast first time I start to rap
Back in '85 they were alive and gave a clap
I layed down, gave a frown last time I saw you
If I never rapped in class this I wouldn't have to go through
I get high when I spy and when I know I'll die
And I know I will die when I cannot try
The people 'round me don't give a s**t or even care
That this life of fame's still lame and it's just not fair
Oooooohhhh La laaa
I check it right 'til you fight for your race
And when you make yourself die and rely forever on your fate
[Hook]
[Interlude - Diddy]
Little f**ker, I ain't f**king with you
Yes, you heard that f**king rant, didn't you?
[Verse 2 - Kanye West (Twista)]
I got drunk and then all these girls touch my junk (Owwww)
I got money, got laid and had nothing to pay (Woooo)
Spoiled love, spoiled hate and I lose my fate
And all them people like "Why the f**k he in that state?"
Models murder me, you and me, we are a 'We'
And we together smoked forever on the streets
Woooaaaahhh
I pay up the bets and I fold
That f**ked me up so now I'm cold
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Ol' Dirty Bastard]
They calling me f**king Dirty
I f**king give a f**k
If you wo' f**k with me
You f**king out of luck
You old guys with the drunkies
Better stay away from monkies
They the junkies they the cells
If you no watched you would've fell
Down in Hell, were they run of you
And kick you
And punch you
And shove you
And smunch you
And take you
And fake you
And bill you
And kill you
I need another life, gimme one, will you?
[Hook]
[Outro - Diddy]
Lay Down, Lay Down
Lay Down, Lay Down
Lay Down, Lay Down
Lay Down


Lose Yourself
[Intro]
We are all born, con una causa
Rap and be known, demostrar tu gracia
Show I am not, mentira, una farsa
Real Rap, Hip-Hop, conciencia no matanza
Manten tu estilo, work hard, wise lyricism
Pierde tu miedo, Lose Yourself, Share Wisdom
Cambia el mundo, scratch that, make revolution
Un solo chance, unveil minds, destroy illusions
[Verse 1]
His palms are sweaty, shaking looking at his enemy
Like if he did a crime he was not forgetting, breath heavily
Time passes by through his eyes, he knows why
It is do or die, he doesnt rap for money, he raps to survive
Now he checks the time, make a wish then say bye
Society has a gun pointed at him because he doesnt want to say  lies
Looks pale, he is paralyzed
But then he remembers he loses himself in each rhyme
His enemy is not finally, getting close to catch him
He spread his wings and flies over beats, lyrically
His mind has no boundaries, his songs speak loudly
What every media and goverment hides from the public
He doesnt want money, or popularity
His goal is to change the world, glory is just a part of it
He was in the bottom, grew up without a family
But he lost himself in his music, that was his diary
[Hook]
You better, lose yourself, in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go!
You onlu get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
(you better)
[Verso 2]
Al escribir sobre un tema, plasmo ideas en forma de letras
No busco complacer a nadie, busco expresar mis problemas
Antes intentaba, ahora me concentro en mis metas
Antes no era nadie, al menos ahora soy Zeroxdan, en esta
Vida, la gente se fatiga, dia a dia
Vivimos un circulo vicioso sin salida
No llegamos sin partida, pero el final es una mentira
Nos morimos sin cumplir con conseguir nuestra alegria
Y al siguiente dia, nos calamos mas mentiras
Vivimos convencidos, de que el poder, cambiara esta porqueria
Queremos un cambio, pero jamas actuamos con rebeldia
Somos ovejas, y aunque veamos el matadero, seguimos en esa via
Por eso yo, me desprendo de cualquier ideologia
O celebre gentio que pretenden cambiar nuestras vidas
Porque el cambio no lo hace ni el amigo ni una compañia
Lo hacemos nosotros, buscando la pasion que nos causa alegria
[Hook]
You better, lose yourself, in the music, the moment, you own it
You better never let it go!
You onlu get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
(you better)
[Verse 3]
I am venezuelan, where we have laws, to mock of them
Do you see things hard? well always blame the government
We do not try to change, in exchange, we look for someone else to  blame
Die! we make him be the devil, we do not spare them
Then he dies, whats left? Nothing
Same problem but we look for another man to damn, damn!
Are we ever growing up? Cuz I feel like we are little kids in a  yard
Never tryna make it up, lets just tear it apart
Y lo que mas me molesta, aparte de no hacer nada
Es que tenemos los recursos para hacer una Utopia, pero en vez de  eso no hacemos nada
Gastamos el rial en bromas innecesarias, se nos va la luz y el  aguapero en otros paises regalamos hogares y casas
Con techo, direcTV, como los ranchos en las montañas
Pero deja que llueva y veras como toda la mision vivienda se  acaba
A gente excava, esta preparada
Para sufrir, porque su partido les diga que dentro de poco vendran  los cambios que esperaban
I do not blame the people, ellos no saben nada
I do not blame the goverment, pero tienen la culpa de lo que pasa
Who I blame is the world itself, por no aprender a amar
We expect changes, pero odiamos a todo el que lo haga
How can we, esperar un mejor mañana
If we only, trabajamos sin una vida sana
All we need, es unirnos y dejar atras las malas mañas
We are humans, o al menos eso es lo que te enseñan
[Outro]
Nos dicen que hacer, que ver, que poner
¿que libertad te dan? ni siquiera puedes escoger
Y si te dejan, ya te lavaron el cerebro
Con campañas promoviendo, algo que solo los beneficia a ellos
We live within a big lie
We are bigger than what we look like
Free Yourself, Lose Yourself, from all the lies
Think for yourself, do not believe what is in plain sight

[Intro]
Hey, wenn du nur einen Versuch oder eine Gelegenheit hättest
Alles zu erreichen, was du je erreichen wolltest
Würdest du den Moment festhalten oder zulassen, dass er dir durch die Finger rutscht?
[Verse 1]
Seine Handflächen sind schweißnaß, die Knie weich, die Arme schwer
Auf seinem Pulli ist schon Erbrochenes - Mamas Spaghetti
Er ist nervös, doch nach außen wirkt er ruhig und bereit
Es krachen zu lassen, doch immer wieder vergisst er
Was er sich aufgeschrieben hat, das Publikum wird so laut
Er öffnet den Mund, doch die Worte wollen nicht heraus
Er schnappt nach Luft, alle machen sich über ihn lustig
Die Zeit ist um, zack!
Zurück in der realen Welt, ups, da ist die Schwerkraft wieder
Da fällt Rabbit, er hat keine Worte herausgebracht
Er ist stocksauer, aber so einfach gibt er nicht auf, nein
Das lässt er nicht auf sich sitzen, er weiß, er steht mit dem Rücken zur Wand
Das ist egal, er hat's drauf
Das weiß er, doch er ist pleite
Er hat so viel Talent, er weiß
Wenn er zurück in seinen Wohnwagen geht, dann
Muss er wieder in die Textschmiede
Diese ganze Stadt voller Rap [Wortspiel "rhapsody"/"rap city"]
Er sollte besser diesen Augenblick nutzen und hoffen, dass er nicht an ihm vorübergeht
[Hook x2]
Geh ganz in der Musik auf, im Augenblick
Du hast die Kontrolle und lässt sie besser nie mehr los
Du hast nur einen Versuch, verpass nicht deine Chance, es allen zu zeigen
So eine Gelegenheit kommt nur einmal im Leben
[Verse 2]
Seine Seele entflieht durch das klaffende Loch
Die Welt wartet nur darauf, dass ich sie mir nehme
Macht mich zum König, während wir uns auf eine neue Weltordnung zu bewegen
Ein gewöhnliches Leben ist langweilig, aber das Leben eines Superstars immer an der Schwelle zum Tod
Alles wird nur schwerer, wird nur heißer
Er zeigt es all diesen Speichelleckern, die an ihm hängen
Hat Auftritte von Küste zu Küste, man nennt ihn den Weltenbummler
Auf einsamen Straßen, und nur Gott weiß
Wie er sich von seiner Heimat entfremdet ist, ist kein Vater mehr
Kommt nach Hause und erkennt seine Tochter kaum noch
Doch rümpft die Nase nicht zu früh, denn hier kommt die Ernüchterung:
Seine Plattenfuzzis wollen ihn jetzt nicht mehr, er ist nur noch ein Ladenhüter
Mittlerweile ist der nächste Tuppes ein Star mit seinem Flow
Er hingegen ist abgestürzt und hat nichts mehr verkauft
So läuft diese Seifenoper und entwickelt sich weiter
Ist vielleicht 'n alter Spruch, aber das Leben geht weiter
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Keine Spielchen mehr, ich zeig dir eine ganz neue Qualität von Zorn
Hau richtig auf die Kacke wie zwei eingesperrte Hunde
Am Anfang hab ich nur gespielt, doch jetzt ist alles anders
Man hat mich durchgekaut und wieder ausgespuckt und von der Bühne gebuht
Doch ich hab weiter gemacht mit meinen Rhymes und die nächste Zeile geschrieben
Das alles war kein Zufall, da steckt jemand dahinter
Der ganze Schmerz in mir wird verstärkt dadurch, dass ich
Mit einem normalen Job nicht über die Runden komme
Kann meiner Familie nicht das Leben geben, das sie verdient
Von Lebensmittelmarken kann ich keine Windeln kaufen
Und dies ist kein Film, hier gibt es keinen Mekhi Phifer [Schauspieler aus "8 Mile"], das hier ist mein Leben
Und die Zeiten sind so hart und werden noch härter
Während ich versuche, mein Kind zu ernähren und zu hegen
Gefangen zwischen der Rolle eines Vaters und der einer Diva
Der ganze Familienstreß zuhause ist zu viel für mich
Kann nicht an diesem einen Ort bleiben
Zu viele Tage der Monotonie haben mich so weit gebracht
Dass ich mich fühle wie eine Schnecke
Ich muß die Zukunft vernünftig planen, oder ich ende im Gefängnis oder tot
Erfolg ist meine einzige Wahl, Versagen nicht
Mom, ich liebe dich, aber wir können nicht in diesem Wohnwagen bleiben
Ich kann nicht in Salem's Lot alt werden [der Wohnwagenpark aus "8 Mile"]
Jetzt kommt es drauf an, jetzt bin ich an der Reihe
Hoffentlich versagen meine Füße nicht, dies könnte die einzige Chance sein, die mir noch bleibt
[Hook]
[Outro]
Du kannst alles schaffen, das du dir vornimmst, Mann

Verse: I'm sick n my souls crushed
Right to the hospital blood rush
No nerves to feel i can't touch
And there's no way out i'm just Ambushed

[Intro]
Still love me? Take this
Ready? One, two three...
[Hook- Eminem]
The more you, put me through
The more it makes me wanna come back to you
You say you hate me, I just love you more
You don't want me, I just want you more
I buy you flowers, you throw 'em at me
I know it's sad but it's makin' me happy
The more that you slap me, the more that it turns me on
Cause you love me, and I love you more
[Verse 1 -57 Pixels]
I'm sick, but not from a syphilis filled trick, but of this chick
Who's a defused bomb but can still be ticked
Off any minute, and she'll scoff at my written
Thoughts but I'll forgive it always. It'll never end. It's
A love-hate relationship
Cause I love the way you're hating it
And the way you look face down taking dick
I thought I was done dating crazy bitch
It sucks but it's just such dumb luck
Being stuck strung snug by young love
But it's done noth-ing but pump blood
To my brain, make anger filled my viens, and a danger to the sane
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - 57 Pixels]
But you're sick of us
Publicly kickin' dust; A ruckus sticking up
The finger at strangers, you're being ridiculous
You crave attention but don't you get enough
From me? No? Well guess what? You're slippin'up
And I may break some tendons since we fisticuffs
Almost every day until it's dusk, cause we simply must
Not giving fucks and stuck being idiots
And not seeing that all that it is doing is killing us
But you walk away; leaving and I'm caught in between the
Thought of you being locked above the ceiling
Or not with me; cheating and prolly out drinking
So I decide to stop you from leaving
And you sock all my teeth in, leave me
Coughing 'n bleeding. See? She
Blocks out all reason. Creeping
On all my tweets 'n, ceasing
Talking to me 'n. "Jesus
Drop and quit breathing."
That's what she said before I was tossed like bad semen
You're the type of person that in fights is striking nuts
Maybe if I threw a lamp at you, you'd lighten up
But it's only blunts that you're lightin'up, I've had enough
I'm done fighting for you like the last plastic cup. But
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - 57 Pixels]
You're nothing to me now, simply no tucks
I stopped wondering when you'd eventually show up
You used to bark my ear off but it wasn't really so rough
[Eminem]
That we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs
We're lyin' to ourselves, that's the beauty of it geah
Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fighting
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin' night
[57 Pixels]
And we try to make it up to each other by doing something nice
But since we barely know each other, it doesn't come out right
So we end up fucking twice, and smoke a couple thick spliffs
But's it just a game to you, I'm a player stuck in the mix
I didn't feel like sharing but the public insist-ed
I be crumbled instants-ly
[Eminem]
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit
[57 Pixels]
I'm a fumble to a kid who has trouble making friends
You're a stupor to a wiz with ambivalent careers
[Eminem]
Hoop-la, all the whoopty-woo
What you put me through, fuckin' whoopty-do
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love
You wouldn't do what, you did last time, you wouldn't screw up
This time, cause this time girl I'm tellin' you what
You do it again I'm fuckin' you up
[Bridge - Eminem]
No matter what you say, or what you do
I'mma hunt you down 'til I find you
No matter where you run, I'll be right there
Right behind you, in your nightmares
So I brought you the flowers, and the candy
All the times that you threw it back at me
So when you hate me, you gon' hate me more
When you find out, you can't escape me whore
[Hook]

Belek viens on bouge

Les mêmes qui t'ouvrent les porte de Bois D'arcy
Surveille ta sœur
Soir je sors
J'me fond au décord
J'te l'ai d'ja dit j'viens mettre tout l'monde d'accord
Le rap n'est pas mort
Loin d'la
Ou alors il revient de l'au-d'la
Eminen fait l'son
J'entends les kho
Qui font le hala
Reste colé au mur
Quand j'ai trop faim
Admire un peut les batxiwhale
Quand les reuf chantent le refrain
Ya trop de pains dans la salle
On s'croirait dans une boulangerie
A coté j'vosi tout c'est kho qu'ont les crocs
Tu m'fait pitié quand tu tourne autour de cette crasseuse
Ta faim la rend gracieuse
Elle rend les maçones en masseuses
Quand j'arive même les sourd bouge la tète
Car ça pète j'veux du lourd ouvre la bouge que j't'alaite
Car j'ai l'son qui faut le fouiny flow
J'te l'ai d'ja dit te balade pas dans mon enclos

[Refrain]
[Couplet 2]
Tu vas rester ici encore longtemps
Allume un joint
Prend du bon temps
T'prend pas la tète choisis ton camp
J'ai l'son à la place des dolipranes
Man écoute La Fouine quand t'as un p'tit peu trop mal au crâne
Money, money, voila c'que j'cherche toute la journée
Avec les kho pas vrai que j'sui devenu mauvais mauvais
Mais quand j'sors j'ai pas ton 500 M.L
Juste une barette dans la poche
Reve de têter tes mamelles
Tu vois ces meufs dans mes bras
Sans quéébra
Par regard des billet de 500
Nous au square on savait pas
Et dans ta boite
J'suis au fond avec un verre
Et quand c'est pas les gars
C'est les meuf qui te regarde de travers
T'as de beau yeux si t'as de beaux billets
Une meuf maligne ça veut des rebeus et puis mes gros billets
Les billets font briller
Pétasse regarde moi droit dans les yeux
Et dis moi qu't'es sincère
Dis moi qu'tu rest'ra dans le luxe et la misère
C'est ça!

[Intro]
Step into my mind
My thoughts

Ouais, je sais que parfois
Les choses peuvent sembler, ne pas avoir de sens pour toi maintenant
Mais! Qu'est ce que papa t'as toujours dit? Tiens toi droit petit soldat
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler...Pourquoi tu pleures? Tu m'as moi
Hailie je sais que ta maman te manque, et je sais que ton papa te manque quand je pars
Mais j'essaie de t'offrir la vie que je n'ai jamais eu
Je sais que t'es triste, même quand tu souris,même lorsque tu ris 
Je peux le voir dans tes yeux, au fond tu as envie de pleurer
Car tu as peur n'est ce pas? Papa est avec toi dans tes prières
Plus de pleurs, sèche tes larmes, papa est là, plus de cauchemars
Nous les surpasserons tout les deux,nous le ferons ensemble!
Laney, tonton est fou,oui, mais il t'aime et fera tout pour que tu le saches
Tout ce qu'on a c'est nous,quand ça vrille, quand ça tourbillonne
Quand ça tournois ou que tout devient flou
Deux magnifiques petites filles,elles ont l'air confuses et étourdies
Je sais que tout ça t'embrouille
Papa n'est jamais là, maman est toujours dans les journaux
J'essaie de te mettre à l'abris de tout ces soucis pour te protéger
Mais j'ai l'impression que quelle que soit la manière
J'ai beau essayé, ça se retourne contre moi
Toutes les choses prenant sans cesse de l'ampleur que papa a été forcé de voir
Papa voulait pas que tu les voies mais tu les as vu autant que moi
Nous n'avions pas prévus tout ça,ta mère et moi
Mais les choses se sont si mal passées entre nous,je ne nous vois plus ensemble
Comme nous l'étions lors de notre adolescence, mais aussi bien sur
Tout se passe toujours pour une certaine raison
J'imagine que ça n'aurait jamais du avoir lieu
Mais c'est seulement quelque chose sur quoi nous n'avons aucun contrôle
C'est le destin, Mais n'ai plus peur, repose ta tête et va dormir
Peut etre qu'un jour nous nous réveillerons et cela n'aura été qu'un simple rêve
Maintenant calme toi petit bébé, ne pleure pas, Tout se passera bien
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler, petite dame
Papa est là pour te porter à travers la nuit
Je sais que maman n'est pas là en ce moment et nous se savons pas pourquoi
Nous avons peur de nos sentiments, ça peut paraître un peu fou, jolie bébé
Mais je te promet, maman se remettra
C'est bizarre...Je me souvient d'une année ou papa n'avait pas d'argent
Maman avait emballé les cadeaux de noël et les avait mis sous le sapin
Et avait dit que certains d'entre eux étaient de ma part
Papa ne pouvait pas les acheter
J'oublierai jamais ce noël,je suis resté assis toute la soirée a pleurer
Papa se sentait comme un clochard
Vois tu , le travail de papa était de faire en sorte que la nourriture
Ne disparaissent pas de la table pour toi et maman
Parce qu’a l'époque
Toutes les maisons dans lesquelles nous avons vécues étaient soit
Cambriolées et brûlées, soit endommagées par les balles sifflantes du ghetto
Et ta maman économisait de l'argent dans un vase afin d'établir une tirelire
Rien que pour toi, pour que tu puisses aller a l'université
Elle avait presque récolté 1000$, jusqu’à quand quelqu'un nous cambriole
Et ça blesse profondément à quel point ça a brisé le coeur de ta maman
Tout commença a s’effondrer à partir de ce moment là
Maman et papa se disputaient beaucoup alors maman déménagea dans le Chalmers
Pour un triste appartement avec une seul chambre
Et papa alla s'installé de l'autre coté de 8mile a Novarra
Et tout ça s'est passé quand papa est allé en Californie avec son CD pour rencontrer Dr Dre
Et vous fis venir maman et toi pour me voir, Mais papa devait travailler
Toi et maman deviez me laisser, puis t'as commencé a voir Papa a la télé
Et Maman n'a pas aimé,Laney et toi étaient trop jeunes pour comprendre
Papa été sans cesse sur la route,Maman pris la même habitude
Et tout s'est passé trop vite pour que nous puissions nous ressaisir
Et tu était là a ce moment et je regrette simplement que tu ais connu tout ça
Car tout ce que j'ai toujours voulu c'était te rendre fière
Maintenant je me promène dans cette maison vide,me remémorant des souvenirs
En regardant des photos de maman et toi, votre ressemblance m'a juste ébahi
On dirait que c'est ta soeur désormais,wouah, je suppose que vous devez être belles
Et papa est toujours là,Laney j'te parle à toi aussi,Papa est toujours là
J'aime le son de cette phrase, il y a de la délicatesse dedans..
Chut, maman est partie pour un moment
Maintenant calme toi petit bébé, ne pleure pas, Tout se passera bien
Ne laisse pas ta lèvre supérieur trembler, petite dame
Papa est là pour te porter à travers la nuit
Je sais que maman n'est pas là en ce moment et nous se savons pas pourquoi
Nous avons peur de nos sentiments, ça peut paraître un peu fou, jolie bébé
Mais je te promet, maman se remettra
Et si tu me le demandes, papa t'achèteras un moqueur
Je te donnerai le monde, J’achèterai une bague en diamant rien que pour toi
Je chanterai pour toi, je ferais n'importe quoi pour te voir sourie
Et si je moqueur ne chante pas et que la bague ne brille pas
Je briserai la nuque de cet oiseau, je retournerai chez le bijoutier qui te l'avais vendu
Et lui ferait manger chaque carat jusqu'au dernier...
Ne plaisantez pas avec papa

IN PROGRESS

Eminem - My Jingle Balls
Chorus:
Jingle balls Jingle balls
Jingle broke my balls (both of them)
Santa Clause is a big fat fraud
You know this if your broke
HEY! (x2)
Verse 1:
Dashing through the snow
With a one horse huge as dick
Put it in his ass
And tell his ass he didn't buy me shit
I'm broke as hell I'm pissed
He knows that but but still
He didn't bring any presents for me!
Fuck Christmas eat dick!(eat dick)
Chorus:
Jingle balls Jingle balls
Jingle broke my balls (both of them)
Santa Clause is a big fat fraud
You know this if your broke
HEY! (x2)
Verse 2:
A day or 2 ago
I thought I'd take a ride
And go to the mail and punch his face
And tell him fucking die
He looks like a used up tampton
I hate him, fuck him Damn FRAUD!
And all I want for Christmas is a knife
To cut his head off!
Chorus:
Jingle balls Jingle balls
Jingle broke my balls (both of them)
Santa Clause is a big fat fraud
You know this if your broke
HEY! (x2)
Outro:
Yeah, well I really feel bad for the poor kids
Because they find out last sooner there's no Santa Clause
The rich kids? They can go like 20 years old
And not know there's no Santa Clause
Because the family is so rich
They buy em what they want
When they want it, how they want it
Where they want it
I would tell Santa, buy me this Santa
At the mall, I would tell him like
"Yo I want this Santa Clause"
And he'd be like "Ho, ho, ho
For Sho I'll give this for you Sonny"
And I wake up in Christmas day and
What do I have at my tree?
Nothing!
Nothing!

[Hook x2]
Hi my name is, what?
My name is, who?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
Hi my name is, huh?
My name is, what?
My name is, chka-chka Slim Shady
[Intro]
Excuse me!
Can I have the attention of the class for one second?
[Verse 1]
Hi kids, do you like violence?
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each
One of my eyelids?
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is?
My brain's dead weight
I'm trying to get my head straight
But I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to
Impregnate
And Dr. Dre said
"Slim Shady, you a basehead!"
Uh-uhhh!
"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted!"
Well, since age twelve I felt like I'm someone else
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with
A belt
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes
Backwards like Kris Kross
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass
Faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast
Come here, slut
"Shady wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg!"
I don't give a fuck
God sent me to piss the world off
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior
High
The only problem was my english teacher was a guyChased him with a stapler
Stapled his nuts to a stack of papers
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip
Cup
Extraterrestrial killing pedestrians
Raping lesbians while they screaming "let's just be friends"
99 percent of my life I was lied to
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper
Make a record about doing drugs and name it after
Her
You know you blew up when the women rush your
Stands
And try to touch your hands like some screaming
Usher fans
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph
So I signed it:
"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole"
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Stop the tape!
This kid needs to be locked away!
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate!
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried
Alive
Am I coming or going? I can barely decide
I just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?(Go ahead)
All my life I was very deprived
I ain't had a woman in years
And my palms too hairy to hide
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would
Throw fits
How you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got
No tits!
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed
Put a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the
Head(bang)
I'm steaming mad
And by the way, when you see my dad
Tell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had
[Hook]

[Intro - K.K.Yo]
The guns pull the guns to my face
They all say that they hate my race
They say "N*gger, get out of here!"
And "You have been drinking far too much beer!"
And I agree I better not die
Better quit drinking, better give it a try
[Hook - French Montanna]
Mama's trynna save me
But she don't know I'm trynna save her
Man them n*ggers trynna play me
Man until I got this paper
You're Nobody, til somebody kills you
[Verse 1 - Rick Ross]
Tell them again on the remix
That those stupid idiots can suck our d**cks
I have no regrets or worries
But I have to remember these stories
I cry tears drops off eyes
Know I'm lucky to survive
I find my country hates me
And women masturbate me
We on fire and lost
Think of all the money it is gonna cost
I stay still and I stay awake
Keep with me for goodness sake
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Miss Cypra]
On the floor making earthquakes
That's the weird noise that I make
I make the Earth shatter, make cars shake
Make windows off buildings and houses break
I see the whole world once again
I count the countries I have seen up to ten
I smoked last night, I'll smoke once more
Even if it makes my lungs sore
Don't get addicted kids
And tell that to your mum and dad
That this cigar that I have got
Is the best one I have ever had
[Hook - French Montanna and Rick Ross]
[Verse 3 - Eminem]
2006 was the year
I lost a friend after drinking beer
And now I think my end is near
Now I have got to sit in the rear
I gotta find another lived one
To tell them all the battles I have won
And how I wanna live forever
And how I wanna learn how to fly
I should atleast give it a try
Even if the wings are very deer to buy
I want to tell all my fans
I do whatever I can
[Hook - French Montanna]
[Verse 4 - The Big Beast]
Haaaaaaaaa, do a backflip
Haaaaaaaaa, do a breakdance
Haaaaaaaaa, murder someone today
Haaaaaaaaa, murder soneone tomorrow
Haaaaaaaaa, tell my n*gger I am strange
Haaaaaaaaa, tell him I just wanna ball
Haaaaaaaaa, I better cut off my ball
Haaaaaaaaa, hang myself in a tree
Haaaaaaaaa ha ha ha
Big Beast is a beast to the killing beast who kills beasts
Haaaaaaaaa ha ha ha
Big Beast is a beast to the killing beast who kills beasts
[Hook - French Montanna and Rick Ross]
[Outro - K.K.Yo (French Montanna)]
Rest in peace, you still here (Ha)
Rest in peace, you still near (Ha)
Rest in peace, don't drink beer
(Til somebody kills you, haaaaaaa)



Eminem
1. No Regrets (Prod. Eminem).mp3

[Intro (during Hook):] - Eminem
Yeah, it's been a ride
I guess I had to, go to that place, to get to this one
Now some of you, might still be in that place
If you're trying to get out, just follow me
I'll get you there
RAP VERSE 1 - GERARD
You can never get me down ,don't wasting your time dissin'
But trying to break me down behind my back will get u missin'
Messing and pissing me off will end up in my ass kissin'
I ain't hissin' ,dismissin' y'all as once I was wishing
Interesting how fucking haters are feeding me right now
Even when it is rotten, but I swallow it like 'OH WOW'
Chewing and sending down ,ruminating it like a cow
Spitting now like the snake ,can't slow down the flow now
Bow down fucking haters , let me be the fucking king
I'm soaring up so high with one-hundred thousand wings
Cutting all the flanks not gonna stop me from rap and sing
I'll swing ,ping,then come down and become the Ostrich thing
Stings like a bee, it's the revenge but I don't give a fuck
Haters gonna hate, they're nothing but freakin' schmoes and schmucks
I'm Bruce mess up with me, watch me transforming to a hulk
No wack ,this track destroyin' you all hating punks
[Hook:]-Eminem
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla! if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
BRIDGE 1 - GERARD
I don't give a damn if u worshiped filthy demons and fell into his fucking trap
You yap,slap,zap and wrap these fiends with holy cross
Sparkling souls trapped,renowned,monsters noticing and you've gotten mapped
RAP VERSE 2 - GERARD
And to the motherfucking Lucifer,you'll never ever gonna rule this world
Even if it happens,that ain't lasting ,wrath of Christ 'bout to unfurl
I'm becoming bold,there will be no order to New World
You'll get swirled ,twirled and whirled,watching demonic faces make me hurled
What u gonna do ,if I reveal all of yours' ugly fangs
I ain't scared of getting shot 'BOOM BOOM BANG'
Your members of the gang,deserve all these vulgar slang
Understand the prophecies before you got pang,whanged,exorcised and got hanged
Fuck off and stop abashing God's holy trinity
There is no divinity,stop wasting your time reaching infinity
Fuck you Illuminati for ruining the peeps' sanity
Y'all will get ripped by mighty sword,if you guys fall into Michael's vicinity
[Hook:]-Eminem
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla! if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)
BRIDGE 2 - GERARD
This is the war between good and evil
Wake up and start retrieval
Stand up,and cause upheaval
Cut yourself free,not gonna buckle down
I see this fucking haters payin' and getting back down
Don't let anyone frown,you're a King with crown,make your haters' ship break and wreck and get drown
BRIDGE 3 - GERARD
I see glory in my vision,no more kidding
It's time to get recognition
Division amid haters brings you out great transition
Rap emission is not lame ,suits for precise,perfect ignition
Makin' and dropping atom bombs, this is hip-hop ammunition
RAP VERSE 3 - GERARD
Losing mind in the flow,now fuck it,this is the diss to all the racist souls
Discriminating based on the color,nation,embarrassing the music world
Letting the white guy to rap gives us the best rapper,I ain't a troll
Extol ,don't be jelly.Encourage and bring up, wherever these great talents roll
Rockets soar,but don't launch it in bad weather to reach your goal
Wait for the right time and conditions for your rap ball to bowl ,this is your spot to stole
I'm a black hole, pulling everyone including my haters ,they need to change ,that's the mission I know,but this is my destiny yo
You're on your own,no spoon-feeding anymore, but never forget the words,keep reminiscing what you've heard
I'll put up my middle finger for the judgement of my critics herd, cause I purged my mind, having no fear,that's why I'm saying
[Hook:]-Eminem
I'm not afraid (I'm not afraid)
To take a stand (to take a stand)
Everybody (everybody)
Come take my hand (come take my hand)
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just letting you know that, you're not alone
Holla! if you feel like you've been down the same road (same road)



Detroit
There is a resilience that rises from somewhere deep within your streets
You can't define it, but you can feel it
You can feel it overflowing from the people who call you home
From people who are always proud to declare, 'I'm from Detroit'
You took our country from it's infancy, into industry
And your name still carries with it the idea of a nation built on steel, muscle and sweat
You became the city that carried the country
The city, like the sport, is built on dreams
People who arrived here, driven to excel
Who know nothing is accomplished without hardwork, without sacrifice
When you hurt, we hurt
Your streets witness our struggle
Your bricks are our rage through the emptiness of each house shuttered, of each factory closed
We've lived through the ups and the downs
But we remain, Detroit
We can never turn our backs on you Detroit, because we are you
My home
The home of Motown, Cadillac and Joe Louis
Through all this, we cannot be defeated, because we have never been defeated
You've built us, you've moved us, you've shaped us
Sometimes down, but never out
Take strength in us, your people
Stay up Detroit

Sometimes it's hard to wake up in the mornin'
Mind f
ull of demons, I don't wanna hear 'em anymore
Got me heartbroken, fine, so many babies screamin'
Cause they seein' destruction before they a see human bein'
So they start smokin' weed, w
e'll never get our day
Until we learn to pray, keep our families in shape
Cause they all broke an' why do ghetto birds die?
Before we learn to fly, somebody else's child caught in guns
Smokin' weed can all make a change
So I'm told but I haven't seen the change unfold
I keep hopin' please, if you prefer to breathe
Communities in need of people that will lead
Keep your eyes open now, can only say I'll try
Until the day I die, I promise to be wise
With my heart open, greed brings only misery
A way to tragedy, so I stay sucker free
Only a few chosen rise, my ghetto queens, rise
Don't be afraid to try, too many of us die
For the door to open wide, my brothers be wise
Stay focused on the prize, though everybody dies
We can only learn to take our anger an' our hate
Control our mental state, settle down an' just set it straight
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump our brakes
'For we said it, regret it later an' let it escalate
Cause by then it's too just late, there's so much we can take
And there's only so much someone can swallow an' tolerate
Up to the point that he just breaks, snaps an' that's all it takes
You'd think that we was learnin' from other rappers mistakes
But we ain't
It's plain to go against, with every artists comes the image
He portrays an' a picture that he paints
But in the midst of all this anger an' this angst
Never once did you hear me say I'm a gangster
An' I ain't hear no complaints
But I know that I will always continue to grow
As long as I lead an' never follow no one else's shadow
There will never be another me an' that I can guarantee
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free
To this day the game will never be the same
No matter how much fame or success they attain
There will never be another me an' no matter what they do
There will never be another you
You can search but you'll never find
You can try to rewind time
But in your hearts an' your minds, we will never die
We are forever alive an' we continue growin' one day at a time
Don't be caught in the publicity an' caught in the hype
Rappers are regular people minus money an' light
Searchin' for fortune an' fame an' super stardom
All the jewelry, all the cars, whose crew is the hardest
Now the hip hop police, the villains is watchin'
An' kids think beef is they only option
Outlaws born filthy, guilty as charged
My memories could die but Makaveli lives on
You think the industry is fun an' no pity with guns
An' when your money is up, that's when your enemies come
So if he died an' came back, would he try to save rap?
We needin' a change, the drama remains
I spent my whole life fightin' myself
That I can't win, so I'm invitin' some help
An' every now an' then I take rights from the left
I'm still just like a kid lookin' for stripes on my belt
An' that there is a fight in itself
So I just pray an' hope God take a like to myself
No matter how much, I try stay alive
I'm gonna die mad, still standin' there in love with my pride
My heart frivolous beats, we past that
I'm tryin' to keep some income comin' in an' collect on my ass cap
The rappers in the game ain't changed
An' I finally realized that we not in the same game
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal wit it
Them 4 5 with cop killers, just some steel wit it
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier
Gotta stay leery an' keep your eyes on the rollers
They do what they gotta do to shackle an' hold us
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin'
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind
An' we continue growin' one day at a time, damn

Now everyone from Otsego County, put your hands in the air and follow me
Everyone from Otsego County, put your hands up. Now look
Now while people became so tough
Notice on how my old friends didn't have their hands up
The town of Gaylord has got you gassed up
Now who's afraid of the Polar Bear?
1, 2, 3 and the 4
1dog, 2dog, 3dog, 4
4dog, 3dog, 2dog, 1
You're dog, he's dog, her dog's, none
That guy ain't no MIC
He knows everything I got to say about me
I am white, I look like a damn bum, I live in a Family House with my Dad and Mom
I got a friend named Chris, he's like a uncle Tom
I do got a sister named Jessica who babysits with kids to have fun
I also work overtime to earn my pride
Plus I also help everyone, if I ever tried
And never try to judge me too
You don't know what the hell I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to CMU, that's a College School
What's the matter, dude? You're poparassa?
I have a oldest Cousin, her name's Marrisa
She now lives with her daughter Addy
And gave birth to another she called her Chloe
Now her ex-boyfriend dosen't wanna help, he's shooked
Cause there ain't no such thing as Halfway Crooks
He's scared to death
He's also scared to look at his Photos, forget going Solo
Forget the beat, I go Rockapella
Forget Marrisa's Ex-boyfriend, Forget a clock, Forget Taxes, Forget everybody
Y'all if you doubt me
I'm a chunk of white trash I say it proudly
And forget this match I don't wanna win, I'm outtie
Just tell those people something they don't know about me

Relapse: Refill (Deluxe Edition) Cover:


[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!
[Verse 1]
And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise! Hi, it's Ike
'bout to get my Ike on I come with a life supply of wife beaters
And my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic
Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite
Come back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke
Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right
Had to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream
With the pliers, like "Ahh!" only a ruthless bastard would do this
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home, pick up two Big Bufords
Scrupulous, girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid!
So when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested
To impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman
And get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement
If you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
I can tell at first glance you're a ho cause your pants are so tight
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco
Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity
Look where these random thoughts get me in senseless mind babble
"What me? Apologize?" That's just the way the rhyme unravels
And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled!
[Hook]
So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick!
Just call me Richard

[Intro: Black Thought]
L.L. Cool J. is hard as hell
Battle anybody I don't care who you tell
I excel, they all fail
I'm gonna crack shells, Double-L must rock the bells
[Verse 1: Black Thought]
You've been waitin' and debatin' for oh so 
long
Just starvin' like Marvin for a Cool J. song
If you cried and thought I died, you definitely was wrong
It took a thought, plus I brought Cut Creator along
Evened up with E-Love down with the Cool J. force
Symbolizin' in the rhymin' for the record of course
I'm a tower full of power with rain and hail
Cut Creator scratch the record with his fingernail
Rock the bells
[Verse 2: Black Thought]
The king of crowd rockers finally is back
My voice is your choice as the hottest wax
True as a wizard, just a blizzard, I ain't taken no crap
I'm rhymin' and designin' with your girl in my lap
The bass is kickin' always stickin' cause you like it that way
You take a step because it's def and plus it's by Cool J
Cut Creator on the fader, my right-hand man
We rock the bells so very well cause that's the name of this jam
Rock the bells
[Verse 3: Eminem]
Some girl's will like this jam and some girls won't
Cause I make a lot of money and your boyfriend don't
L.L. went to hell, gonna rock the bells
All you washed up rappers wanna do this well
Rock the bells
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now I'm world-wide known, whether you like it or not
My one man band is Cut Creator a.k.a. Philpot
He'll never skip it, only rip it when he's on the fader
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know the episode who's on the wheels
He'll drive the cross fader like a cut mobile
So precise with a slice that you know he's greater
What's my DJ's name, Cut Creator
Now you know, what do you know, Earl roles the weed
I go to the store and get Old Gold
So all you crabby lookin' nappy headed girls get back
Cause there's a ten to one chance that you might get smacked
Rock the bells
[Verse 5: Eminem]
The bells are circulatin' the blood in your veins
Why are girlies on the tip, L.L.'s your name
Cut Creator's good, Cool J. is good-good
You bring the wood pecker, I'll bring the wood
The bells are wippin' and rippin' at your body and soul
Why do you like Cool J., we like rock and roll
Cause it ain't the glory days with Bruce Springsteen
I'm not a virgin so I know I'll make Madonna scream
You hated Michael and Prince all the way, ever sense
If their beats were made of meat, then they would have to be mince
Rock the bells
[Verse 6: Black Thought and Eminem]
[Black Thought] So listen to the lines of rhyme, I rhyme on time
He'll cut the record in a second, make your DJ look blind
So all you jerry-curl suckers wearin' high-heel boots
Like ballerinas, what I mean is you're a fruit-loop troop
[Eminem] All you're gonna be, wanna be, when will you learn
Wanna be like Cool J., you gotta wait your turn
Some suckers don't like me, but I'm not concerned
Six Gs for twenty minutes is the pay I earn
[Black Thought] I'm growin' and glowin' like a forest blaze
Do you like Michael Jackson, [Eminem] we like Cool J
That's right, I'm on the mic with the help of the bells
There's no delayin' what I'm sayin' as I'm rockin' you well
Rock the bells

[Eminem]Yo, Slim Shady!
[Royce] Yo, Royce 5-9
[Eminem]Y'all want to make a movie?
[Royce] What..
[Eminem]We got the film right here
[Royce]
What?
Yeah I'm one of them pretty rappers
Buck if I really hafta, I really slap ya
King of Detroit who they naming the city after (what?)
Scandalous partners, whose grammar hammers the hard shit
Into your heart with, content, yo who want to start with
Experts, Bad and Evil is coming soon
MC's get stuck, head first back in they mother's womb
This shit is written, in my eyes I'm the illest MC spitting (what?)
Leaving all of you cats shitting kittens
I gotta diss you, my niggas be cockin pistols
Shot and split you, fuck splittin the profits with you (what?)
Six percent, of y'all niggas is just pretend
Clicks with clits, pussy niggas stink with dicks (what?)
Niggas act bully, and blast for the fast penny
My auto is fully, plenty of niggas packing semi
Speak darts; yo you get paid? Rhyming about it is the sweet part
You can't be street smart with a cheap heart
Five Nine, a street nigga with deep feeling (what?)
I keep illing, my steez willing to keep killing (what?)
Fuck rap, a lot of y'all all is just acts
Trust that - you rhyme all wack on rough tracks
Bust and then we all black when you get bust back at
Fuck that, you get blast at, you get laughed at
And I'ma spit thunder (what?) stick to my guns
Niggas is finished before they gimmicks, one-hit wonders
What? Big balls, that's why when I spit, your clique stalls
I'ma pit bull, I'm just dog, I'm just raw (what?)
Split y'all, holla, "It's on!" Then I diss y'all
All of y'all niggas get pissed on claimin you pissed off
[Chorus: Eminem and Royce: x 2]
Y'all want drama? want to make a scary movie?
Rappers comin in with they team and carry toolies
You can jump right out of the screen and barely move me
We hard-hitting, directing and starring in it
[Eminem]
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstanding
Any man planning to battle will get snatched out of his clothes
So fast it'll look like an invisible man standing
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail
Bill Clinton, hit this, and you better inhale
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me
Is getting taking advantage of like Monica Lewinksy (Leave me alone!)
Came home in a frenzy, pushing a ten speed
Screaming to Aunt Peg (AUNT PEG!!!!)
With three spokes sticking out of my pant leg
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine
Damn it I like pain (AHH!)
And you should be anywhere that I might gain
You rap knowing you wack
You act up and I'm throwing you down a flight of steps
Then I'm throwing you back up em
If they don't like the track, fuck em
The rap struck em harder then getting hit by a Mack truck
And then backed up on
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass
Better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch (Ding! Ding!)
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly (Hurry up man!)
I'm sicker than a 2Pac dedication to Biggie
I'm free-falling feet first out of a damn tree
To stampede your chest till you can't breathe
And when I'm down to my last breath
I'm a climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step
And still laugh half bent
[Chorus]
[Eminem]
Bad... the bad...
[Royce] Uhh, when the bad meets the bad.. yo..
[Eminem]The evil
[Royce] Take the evil with the evil
[Eminem]Put em together
[Royce] What? Nine-nine
[Eminem]Two times.. Slim Shady.. Royce the Five Nine

[Verse 1: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't calling
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got em
There probably was a problem at the post office or something
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up man, how's your daughter
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her, I'mma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Ruckus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan
[Hook: Vanessa Carlton]
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you
Tonight
[Verse 2: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside the concert
You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blistering cold for you for four hours and you just said no
That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fucking idol
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like being lied to
Remember when we met in Denver
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way
I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my Mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put em on
Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See everything you say is real and I respect you cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan
P.S. we should be together too
[Hook: Vanessa Carlton]
[Verse 3: Eminem (as Stan)]
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive
You know the song by Phil Collins "In the Air of the Night"
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See Slim, shut up bitch, I'm tryna talk
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see, I ain't like you
Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh shit, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this shit out
[Hook: Vanessa Carlton]
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass us by
Cause you know I'd walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you...
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too
I say that shit just clowning dog, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling
To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doing just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad
Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was, it was you, damn

Wow, it's been a few months since we've profiled a creme-de-la-creme MC in need of some nurturing from a record company. During our ninety day hiatus, however, our ever-reliable "Flavortracker 2000" came across a target that, in many ways, redefines the term ill. He goes by the name of Eminem (as in the popular candy). After making a buzz in the Detroit area for quite some time, he just recently gained the hip-hop nation's attention with his impressive showing in events like the Rap Olympics. One glimpse of the contents within his Slim Shady demo, one can't help but recognize that this rapper of the Caucasian persuasion's got skills.
     As far as flow, he keeps it simple, yet extremely effective. In "Murder, Murder," he kicks a humorous tale about a bank heist gone wrong: "Left the keys in the van/ With a gat in each hand/ Went up in Eastland/ Shot a policeman/ Fuck a peace plan/ If citizen bystands/ The shit is my hands/ Here's your life span/ For what your life's worth, this money is twice than/ Grab a couple grand and live in Iceland/ See, I'm a nice man, but money turned me to Satan." Another guaranteed rewinder is the semi-demented "Just The Two Of Us," a crazy tale about the actions Eminem takes upon his baby's mother. With wifey placed comfortably in the back of his trunk, Em drives far and wide explaining to his seed the reasons why "daddy had to bury mommy."
     Point blank, this ain't your average cat. This Motor City kid is a one-of-a-kind talent and he's about to blow past the competition, leaving many melted microphones in the dust.
