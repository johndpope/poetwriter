[Verse 1: Nas]
What up?
Escobar season begins
Repent your sins
Nine-Six Check it
Spark the lye with the eight-forty I fly
Pretty thug
 
show no love its like when doves cry
Maybe I'm just too demanding
, 
parked the Land
Mark Buchanan
, 
fuck a job I'mma die scramblin
Digger gold, dig a bigger hole in ya soul
Que Pasa
, 
Pablo's throne cabron
At the airport the Mobb picked me up in a truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck
 
never scared to get stuck
So whats the deal Papi?
Heard the feds could of knocked me
Had the cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating, my name holds weight, we motivatin'
Hustling, as if God was dancing with Satan
The Firm waitin'
, 
to get ajourned cause we facing
Double life
, 
thuggin for life
, 
you taste it
The white numbin ya toungue
I bought it from Dominicans
A suitcase of benjamins swung tight in his fingers
Had the Firm gun slingers,
 
hit the lights,
 
grab the white
Murder everything in site, and
 
jet in the beamers
Now im home with the
 
phone screaner
Resting the stones in a jewelry cleaner
Checkin my mail reading my supoena
To the witness standing
, 
I got remanded
Livin on the 4th building and can't stand it
Gotta fight my case from the inside
Niggas telling
, 
I felt it coming when my pockets started swelling
But thats the game for ya
Hid a stash to ya lawyers
Supreme court,
 
Queens New York will bore ya'
Suited up, booted up, with the jail cut
Million dollar bail what?
Z put up the house and I was out
Word the Fuck Up
Time to get the shit on son
Tryna trap a nigga
Incarcerate me yo'
Check it tho, yo, yo
Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die
(cross my heart hope to die)
Im gonna make it if I try, cross my heart hope to die
Praise the Lord, ive been scarred with hot water
Days are shorter
, 
next court dates around the corner
Money ain't the same, shit is outta order
Since the days of Rich Porter
Something gotta give
, 
I ain't trying to bid
Now I run up in cribs,
 
body shit, but no women no kids
In the Bridge where the murderers live
I used to make a quarter million monthly
I was ill until they sunk me
Killed the snitch
 
with the pump 3 shots
Bought a passport off a junkie
The Firm helped me flee out the country
Word and I'm out, Pakastinian land
Chilling with my man Jungle
The 
commissioner Stout
Killa B, what it is nigga firm biz

[Nas] Yeah, hahaha
"When I flow for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"Nas.."
[Nas]- 1st Verse
Yo
Explode, 
my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin out Chryslers
, 
e-z wider paper
Pops puffin his cess
, 
punchin his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon and Jungle, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul,
 
the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin
Learned early, to fear none
 
little Nas was huntin
Livin carefree laughin, got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo I'm in my second childhood
[Hook: repeat 2X]
"Cause when I flow the for the street.." - "
.. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" -
 
"Nas.."
"
Resurrect
, through the birth of my seed.." - 
"Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." -
 
"Get yours, nigga"
[Nas]- 2nd Verse
Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair,
 
still slingin
, 
got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's
In the same spot he stood since eighty-five
, well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Saved by his mom's, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
With young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right? He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth up, he's in his second childhood
[Hook]
[Nas]- 3rd Verse
Baby girl she's always talkin
 
name droppin
 
hangin late
Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy,
 
craves shoppin
E poppin Ecstasy takin,
 
won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin
, 
stuck with limitations
Lustin men, many hotels
, 
Fendi Chanel
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin,
 
mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doin well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right for life
, 
guess she's in her second childhood
[Hook]

[Intro: Nas]
Crack fucked up the world, and I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era who made a lot of money of that shit
I wonder if it fucked with their conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking themselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from
[Hook: Tyler The Creator & Frank Ocean]
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
48, 48, 48 states I get it in
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow
I can get it for the low
[Verse 1: Tyler, The Creator]
Shit is getting warmer on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother is a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you’re accustomed what you’re used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind and it’s all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up, it’s my fault
You can blame me motherfucker, for killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger, all I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tuck, didn’t realize this game fucked up some lives
“Oh, how’s mine?” -- my conscience eats it up all the time
But other than that I’m fine, I got a little money in my pocket
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Tyler, The Creator]
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop I stole that truck
And I sold that dope
Motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I’m sorry
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry
Could have been a actor and won that Oscar, said, I'm sorry
I sold that soap and I killed black folk, I’m sorry
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my momma all cool, I'm sorry
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry
[Outro: Nas]
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip, the transaction, the hustling
Even more than the money, it's just your job
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person, and to do this and do that
You become the go to guy forever and next thing you know you’re in too deep
Way too deep, scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
Dudes is buying choppers to shoot down people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other, nobody wins
Ya know what I mean?

Introducing...
Nas Escobar
No
reaga
Natur
e
And Femme Fatale
[Nas]
Black pirellis rolling over this makaveli
Two platy LPs
Still the feds tap my celli
Made a mil and another mil
Just signed another deal
From the bridge ever summer deal
Niggas run to steal
Cracks and bundles
Wanna be down ask Jungle
React humble but we blast guns too
Now to son you is a deeper plan
So when I jam
Reach the pan
Check the sale let the sound scan
Keep a brown tan
From vacationing
Chicks in Vegas
Tryna guess us how much we made to spin
Two Tiphannys from the Colosseum
Green olive BMs
Tracks from TM lack when we see em
Grip the heat
When the sixth season
Jump out the S4s
And test yours
Tudor watches
Allah watches
Stubborn, you won't admit that Escobar got this
On top let me explain what the cock is
Firm Biz came livin'
Naturally fly, diamond rings glistenin'
Make it seem sickenin'
What's really ill is how the team's clickin'
Femme Fatale on some dope shit
Flow sick we stay incorporate
Firm giving you a dosage
Of high explosives
You kidnap we kidnap
You blast shit, I did that
Cuttin' through the chase we bring it to where you live at
I wouldn't play you
I'd rather try you by your label
[Mary J.Blige]
Miss maximillion
Exotic diamonds let it charm
Legal life of bear arms
Protecting my squad from harm
Murder, Danger
Backstabbers and snakes
Murderers and Jakes
Spend thugs but the drugs a case
Fuck y'all feel
And them accusations you make me
Wow femme fatale we increasing the stakes
Platinum plates choosin' isles
Like my cheese willie style
850 on the dig and if you see me
[Femme Fatale]
Major league mamis
With the bodies
Got your clique quick to buy these
Who wanna try these?
Firm colleagues
Somali's, think they're badass
16 bars on that ass
Y'all niggas shat ass
Ali aye quatro
Play the passenger of chaco
6 to got though
Think you hot but you not though
Play the corner
Be the type of bitch to run up on ya
Much longer
While y'all get short bread like launa
You're a goner
Rhyme shoota, top shootas
With the lugas true das
Stats rulas
Firm biz grab the cougas
[Noreaga]
It be the firm biz getting it off
Slow regez the elegant black prince
We take the top gator
Black and shrotopass like im a raider
Sophistacater
Hang tight like dre right
Flow like hawian in the broad day light
I give all that I have
All in my power to see the day
That the crowd weighted
You expired and outdated
Re segregated
None of my people graduated
Ain't no progress in the projects
It's the same process
Rise to the top of New York
Keep the digest
Through all my cornets
Global solar
It's young omar
The shuffuler
We analyze who they really are
Familiar, blow holes into your interior
You minute, little man
You think you general?
[Nature]
I put the hinds betters
Fake thugs styles glued together
Saying old rhymes show signs
You're through whatever
Eat your heart out
I play my part now
Fiend to be part of the squad
But I'm not gonna be shot down
Who's how now? I'm disgusted at you
Rap doo doo
It's funny if you let these cats fool you
The whole no wait
Your values dying at a slow rate
Opposition track live niggas pop gats
Been doin' this since the days of hot tracks
Claimin' you in the firm how's that?
When you got your spot jacked
Read between the lines
The foulest dreams was lead to blind
Tonight is excellence redefined
In the form of Nature, Noreaga
Nas, Mary J. Blige
Femme Fetale on the rise
Manager extraordinaire
My man, Jungle
Pussy rebundled like desert plans
Spitting vivid raps
My whole clique rocking fitted hats
Millionaire status play the block give it back
Thanks to who?
My pen names tight like langston hughes
Generating chips, picking which banks to choose
Clever robberies, on deposits
I got this, why niggas on the blocks
Stare at bitches gossip
I pop shit so understand me
From day one I rap whole new guns
That run in the family
[Noreaga]
Wa dada dang wa da da dang Hey Listen to my mac milli just go bang
Wa dada dang wa da da dang this is the firm biz

Son you gonna set it? set it son

[Nas]
I peep you frontin, I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name, what the ugh
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown cat's through, blazin at his crew
I can't believe it achieve
Yo Cormega whatever whatever whatever
[Cormega]
Pushin' a
 
red lex
With many screams inside the headsets
So much beef, police surprised I ain't dead yet
I keep red tech in the passenger seat
To match their heat
It's so real if I don't see you I'm splashing your beep
It's on the kid
Whoever gets his first
It's going to kids dirt
My soldiers be cold blooded vultures
And cold blooded
Yo on the street we control hundreds
I drink polatas so all my people roll blunted
Your man froze when I rolled up
I symbolize death like a cobra
Attacks your life here it's over
Black you effed up
Never should've messed up
My black cocksucker scared to die tough luck
You know my steelo im like
 
Al Pacino
Yo 
Nas Escobar
 grab the mic and flex a bar
[Nas]
I'm in the black limo
Jack Daniel through the crack window
I spot the fake red dot his face like a Hindu
Grab the symbol
Show examples to make examples
Essential amounts you owe to the fam crew
Firm affiliation paper chasing
Chip glossy rich pablo es cubano
Sophisticano
Yo blazing halos like shadow
Yo nigga im the castro
Im coming through on your wack crew
What you gonna do
Cormega pick the mic come through
[Cormega]
Ay yo I get mines
Well enough to be considered big time
My crew a chosen few legit minds
Who live prime
Shorty's on some fly stuff
Admitted that can't resist mines
Mahogany complexion
Body probably dressed in
My ill tommy hill collection
When I be flexin', sketch it
My selection of words are type effective
When I rhyme words are verbalized remain present
In mines, I'm like an with air macs nikes on
Recite nice on mics 
strike like a python
My gold chain with ice on lookin' trife on
My Jacuzzi filled with tight warm relaxed lookin steaming
Lounging like a falcon on a mountain top at Egypt
Cats schemin when they see my rocks gleaming
Mega shine forever rhyme wicked like a demon
Where my charcoal, new balance a lot yo
The narcs go knocked my man Marco
His money was marked yo
I regulate a sharp flow
But in my life bucaso
My mom died when I was five and never left my heart yo
I symbolize rive alive niggas
Ghetto's where I live
Considered my rhyme the oasis
Because rap was a desert
And I helped minds escaped it
Yo Nas link it up it's like an ill typed bracelet
[Nas]
Fake thug, no love
You get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low
I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak cats get played out
Get robbed and laid out
Prostitute turned snitch
I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range
Empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, thirty-two shots
Ya'll niggas don't want none of this
[Cormega]
Ayo check it my man Joe Shan is downstairs
My man Georgie is lounging downstairs
My man Big Ice he lounging in Queensbridge
And all you real cats know what time it is
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
On the real all you crabs cats know the deal
Now check the new verse
Check the new verse it's ill
Yo my millennium got people mind prisoner
Pain digital wood brain material
Rims spin sinister
Grin like John Dillinger
Iced out medallions my style will keep killin' ya
Misery and jealousy when you envision me
I'm getting mines and still livin' on the strength of me
You never bust nothin' or got ill touched nothin'
My baby face ice grill I heard something for real
In any cipher i'll serve em like a viper
I go for mines like I go for time on Rikers
Steelo like pacino benzino benz bilo we know
People we dope like mafiaso like gambino
Where Sergio Tacchinio took a jab in a casino

Life is real a lot of trife things be happening
I love yall kids I love my whole mobb deep fam
It's real like that you know life has tied me man
Yo I lived the life of 62 pick ups
Pumping on corners beat downs and stick ups
Seeing events in which you have to stay silent
Murder extortion and all types of violence
Yo kids living a life ghetto heaven
Selling cracks getting ready to attack with nines and mac elevens
You know my style
You can't stop what knocks me down
Peace to AZ, Nas, and figure Foxy Brown
My whole firm team is ill no doubt
I can't forget the commissioner he's called Steve Stoute
With the ill benz
He rocks the ill dimes and ill rims
You know my steelo
I'm like Al Pacino
God bless the life of my man nino
[Nas]
It's sort of like the conclusion to "Color Purple"
Brothas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where Brothas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger plus the trees
But whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, but yo that's another subject
I love teks let's get it off
Yo what up what up
[Cormega]
Yo funkmaster flex you know I got the ill lex
I wear my guests in apendix
And cash my cheque in flesh shit
My man escobar be lighting a weed
And I proceed with all the ill types of rhymes you need
I'm not the new jack, or crew rack I'm like the next man
Cormega, I just got signed to Def Jam
My man Nas is down with me
A lot of sucker rappers they can't diss me
It's like that, you know it's like that
We'll strike back Queensbridge style
My mobb deep people is mad foul
A juvenile delinquent wet your prequit
I get my money numerous occasions
It's frequent my man Ike
Tried to avalanche ice watch
You know my steelo Al Pacino
Yo Escobar
[Nas/Cormega]
Escobar season
Cormega 4 reason
We with it what
I'll stay high triple beamin
Queensbridge

[Verse 1: Nas]
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you comin', he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through, but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aiight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a
[Hook: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just a accident murderer
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We grew up doin' graffiti
Now hollows is gettin' heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin' weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck 'em all, we ballin' 'til they come lock us up
Twenty to life, I'm clubbin' blowin' twenty tonight
We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a tec off the shelf, live forever that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodgin' my clique
Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin' chips
In a hole, sell your home nigga don't sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't
[Hook]
[Bridge: Nas]
Accident murderer, accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessin'
Tell me who you impressin'?
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make 'em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playin' wrestlin'
Watch 'em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin'
But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin' where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they killin', they reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Fake 'til my nigga draws, what you want a name? Tell me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Ryan Leslie]
Born on June 4th - the mind of a Gemini
Plight of a societal OutKast - Aquemeni
You bought a hammer just to silence the clamour
For another real G on the block, after your man got popped
When shots rang out, you ran for cover
Bought your first gun, spent a couple grand for another four
Told your mom you was preparing for war
She signed the shape of the cross each time you ran out the door
But you ain't never had the mind of a killer
You was more of an actor - with the movement of a small time dealer
When the feds came they got you for light work
Facing a few years, defence attorney told you it might work
To cop a plea and turn informant - you could save a few tenants
And at the same time reduce your sentence
You wore a wire to the home of your old supplier
And when they raided, you ain't make it - you was caught in the fire
Of an accident murderer
[Hook]

[Intro:R&B Sample] (Nas)
I'm from the 
other side of town (For real) out of bounds
To anybody, who don't live around
I never learned to share or, how to care (Light somethin up)
I never had no teachings, a
bout being fair
[Verse 1: Nas ]
Yo! Thank God for the Rolls symbol on my hood
Silver lady with the wind she pop up pretty wood interior
I stay a good nigga, don't speak on facts unless you correct you losin respect
Ferrari floors are clean, draws are clean, what!
Verses, all my bars are mean
Lil' money, lil' risk, lil' faith, lil' guidance
It ain't rocket science your prophet try to be honest
Paul Wall deemed,
 
IWC watches
But I ain't walk around with no poodle under my armpit
Actin all she she,
 
cause I ain't got it easy
I been through it, slim through R never PG
[Hook]:
You across the track, completly relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back
You across the track, completly relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back
[Verse 2: Papoose]
Don't you ever try to stop the uprisin of a Kingdom
I got enough bars to take away your fuckin freedom
My arms long enough to box the devil I could beat him
If his arms long enough to box God I'm a weave him
He wanna learn he's starvin for knowledge I'm a feed 'em
But if he wise I'm hungry for for knowledge I'm a heat 'em
If you was manifestin all them lessons that you readin
You would even believe in the teachings that you preachin
Heathens sneak even left leakin in the beacon
The gangs peeped him they In Living Color like Keenen
And hell I ain't talkin about breathin
Stupid why you reachin my hand stay on the pound like Lincoln
I'm powerful you weaklin, 
the firin pen went to the spring
Summer, fall like the seasons in your region
Papoose and Nas is a legion
Everything happens for a reason, have a good evenin
[Hook]:
You across the track, completly relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back
You across the track, completly relaxed
You take a warning back, don't you never come back

[Dave Atkinson & Trackmasters]
[Intro: AZ]
This is what, this what they want huh
This is what it's all about
Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, you kna'mean
Niggas coming sideways thinking stuff is sweet man
Niggas don't understand the four devils; lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man
[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo sit back, relax, catch ya contact,
 
sip your cog-ni-ac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack a new cat sit back, worth top dollar
In fact touch mine's and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who could relate, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em, tie em with tape no escape
The Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black
[Verse 2: Cormega]
Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche
My destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die, he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin
They found his head on the couch with his dick in his mouth
I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina they will see you
When you re-up bring your heater all your cream go between us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream
 
and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turning niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus,
 
Mega the pretty boy
With mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, my mind is seeing through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sipping on crushed grapes,
 
we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickening, he just finished bidding upstate
And now the projects is talking that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hell fire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars
 
meeting Foxy at the Mosque
Moving cars, 
your top papi Señor Escobar
[Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro
Firm deep, all my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions
 
in the biggest bundle
In the Lex
 
pushed
 by my nigga 
Jungle
E Money bags
 
got Moet Chandon
Bundle of sixty-two
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shitting hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a fat marquess piece
Laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters,
 
Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm baby,
 
from BK to the Bridge
My nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz
So what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, 
sipping Crist-ies
Sitting on top of fifty grand 
in the Nautica Van
We stay incogni' like all them
 
thug niggas in Marcy
The Gods they praise Allah with
 
visions of Gandhi
Bet it on my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal 
and Baba Shallah spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke, raw though
An ounce mixed with leak that's pure though
Flipping the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper
He had a fucking villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama but wait it's half-and-half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half
Get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen now add the other two that Mega bringing through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three
We got three quarters of another ki
The Firm baby, volume one

[Foxy Brown]
Check it, uhh
Protect this, nigga for the necklace
I throw the death wish; the pretty slim sex shit
The rep this, remember Fox said this
We on some next shit, we are blessed this
The scares on our backs mean we met this
To lie for 'em
The 25 sentence to keep my eyes on 'em
I'm straight, knowing when Allah's shine on 'em
Shitty drugs and drama, opposite three pretty thugs and a 
don momma
Filling the rest, the steel in their chest
When Boogs threw the kiss of death, it was over
And we laid out, chill I was open off the way he ate out
It was real, fo'real I was fucking with mills and he was frag-ile
We wyling, the brown stallion
Stay styling, on the low fouling
The whole Firm wyling, we lucked it
I know the trick bitch he fuck with, on some duct shit
Heard through the grade that she sucked it
Firm, 
Sos
 and 
Esco
, mad loco
Fox and Mega for whatever,
 and through this cheddar
We gon' stay family, 'til we fry though
The fam will never split even if one of us die though
Along with our get go's, we gon' blaze 'til it brick-o's
Peep the Ill-Na-Na, sweet taboo
The Firm tattoo on the Dada
Now tell me what crew hold it down like we do da da?
[AZ]
'
Til the death of this, murderous moves pursue effortless
Ice necklace, high priced dressed executives
Peep the grammar, slim built, strong stamina
Forty-four nickel plate long with the silencer
Play for keeps in shut eye you stay sleep
Shit remain deep in get shells thrown at ya Range jeep
Giuliani suite got all the kings going up for creek
Devil life beers now who's left controlling the streets?
No intelligence, strictly slow niggas minds negligence
It's evident, Feds mess up, raid ya residents
We're all for living, 
heavyweight Firm division
Mind, I check mine, eat swans, cause it's religion
You know the steez, take aim, cock and squeeze
It's the prophecies, not the philosophies of Socrates
Next up? (Yo I believe that's me)
Ayo Mega, represent for the family
[Cormega]
Ayo, the Feds got me in the top ten
Cause when my door got knocked in
My four-four main cocked in
My sinister mind, shines like a Dillinger
Mega exhausted, Babyface crime Emperor
Yo, life is based on cultures and creeds
And peep the way drug fiends, the thug nigga sees
I've seen niggas lined up, handcuffed and tied-up
Coke prices rise up when drugs supply dry-up
The Millennium drives up
Rims semi blinds ya eyes temporarily
Mind of Mega be heavily armed for felonies
Shine you could never see
The next fat cat out of NYC
It Was Written like ghetto life hieroglyphics
Living since my real niggas bailed me out of prison
A lot of schemes, cause the narcotics team in Queens
Had marked dollars then the knowledge of fiends
My dream is the legacy of Montana treasury
Fake thugs couldn't even take slugs or bury me
[Nas]
To all thoroughbreds taking the corners, y'all need to join us
Firm's most powerful nation of rap performers
High class, Generals, Confidence, paying lawyers
Swift as Oscar De La Hoya, green beret warriors
Fakes I peep them like the J. Kennedy tape
In the new with Jew busting all in the face
Another word yo, you see through
My man built the Sugar Hill from a sweet tooth
We all eat, cause I speak truth and educated
Black youth, street diploma
Teach Greeks and Romans, but the legacy was stolen
It's a Firm thing, generally gleam
I wrote the theme on how to sell a million
While you crabs is mad at your promotion team
I roll with the nicest Fox
Black ice, pushing Benz without a license
Gear tight as vice grips, 
Nas got 19 wifies
Seven shiesty, nine of them piceses
Three white meats
 under tight cheese
Wilding
, 
big links is heavy like bricks
That you throw on a pit-bull neck's while 
feeding 'em raw steak
It's core take, more cake
I take the crown of the so called king of the town and lock it down

[Hook]
Africa must wake up, the sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring, may a better day come
Yesterday we were kings, can you tell me young ones --
Who are we today?
Yeah, now
[Verse 1 - Nas (+ Damian Marley)]
The black oasis, Ancient Africa the sacred
The sleeping giant,
 
science, art is your creation
I dreamed that we could visit old Kemet
Your history is too complex and rigid for some Western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praise bridges that carried us over
The battle fronts of 
Sudanic
 soldiers, the task put before us
(Do you hear me now?)
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Nas]
Who are we today? The slums, diseases, AIDS
We need that all to fade, we cannot be afraid
So who are we today?
We are the morning after, the makeshift youth
The slaveship captured, our diaspora is the final chapter
The ancestral lineage built pyramids
America's first immigrants, the kings and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers
Astronomers, the first prophets and the doctors were us, us
[Bridge - Damian Marley]
Now can we all pray?
Each in his own way
Teaching and learning
We can work it out
We'll have a warm bed
We'll have some warm bread
Shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother nature feeds all
In fameine and drought
And though selfish in ways, not to share is out
What's a tree without root?
Lion without tooth?
A lie without truth?
You hear me out!
[Chorus - x2, but the second one is:
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
What tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were kings
I tell ya young bloods
The world is yours today
...]
[Bridge: K'naan x2]
Dadyahow daali waayey, nabada diideen
Oo ninkii doortay dinta, waadinka dillee
Oo dal markii ladhiso, waadinka dunshee
Oo daacad ninkii damcay, waadinka dooxee
[Translation]
Oh ye people restless in the refusal of peace
And when a man chooses religion, aren't you the ones to kill him?
And when a country is built, aren't you the one's to tear it down?
And when one attempts to tell the truth, aren't you the one's to cut him down?
[Guitar/Instrumental break]
[Nas - talking]
We want to thank y'all, everybody out there
This is Nas, Damian Marley
Distant Relatives
We're all distant relatives, no matter where you from, where you live
How near or far
Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel
We're all fam, we're all distant relatives
So that's why we came together -- one of the reasons
Why myself and Damian came together
Cause we all come from one place, and that's Africa
That's right, you too. And you
The whole world!
We're all family, we're just spread out all over the place
So to all my distant relatives, let's take it back home!
[Hook]

[Intro]
Yeah it's like wakin' up from a bad dream
(America)
Just to figure out you wasn't dreamin' in the first place
[Verse 1]
If all I saw was gangsters comin up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta I mold myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap I'm a monster
Streets deceiving they can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for prada beaver
For cold winters tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix caked up
Tryna take what I'm eatin came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this savvy mouth
Wild hardly a man's man who woulda knew
The beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and stella mccartney's
For years all that how could I not be dead?
This old german said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my benz and called that a nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme my stories is
I'm from the home of the thieves
America pay attention
(america)
Wake up this is not what you think it is
(america)
America pay attention
(america)
This is not what you think it is
[Verse 2]
Blessed the lord is a g he gotta be
Who's the god of suckers and snitches the economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me stop and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers athletes and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances trends and fashion?
But when it comes to residuals they look past us
Woven into the fabric they can't stand us
Even in white tee's blue jeans and red bandannas
America pay attention
(america)
Wake up this is not what you think it is
(america)
America pay attention
(america)
This is not what you think it is
America
(america this is not what you think it is)
[Verse 3]
Assassinations diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people built a new nation
Involuntary labor took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite through your covenant
Love to sit in on the senate and tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair she read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her with an apron like bring me my dinner dear
She's the 'nigger' here ain't we in the free world?
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery
When the empire fall imagine how crazy that'll be
America
(america america)
America
(america this is not what you think it is)
America
(america this is not what you think it is)
America

*Sample* Nas: "Political"
Newscaster: "Recently there has been an emergence of socially
Conscious and political rappers. It seems to be
A new trend in the Hip-Hop world."
*DJ scratches sample* Nas: "Nas is a rebel to America" 3X*
[Vers 1: Nas]
Yeah, check it, uh
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard lil' longer, feel strong and I'll stop ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough, wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to stop our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
Ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MC's on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody from the hood as my councilman, uh
[Hook: Kelis]
Yeah I think about this every day, that's the American Way, shit
(Repeat x4)
[Verse 2: Nas]
Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
Israeli men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Says, "Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black ho"
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'mma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most woman who love Giovanni or Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve the Hermes purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh
[Hook]
I don't care about the runaways
I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS
But I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think they're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane
As long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way (Nas: Uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't stop, uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way
*Sample* Nas: Nas is a rebel to America!

[Verse 1: Nas]
I walk the blocks like whatever god
, 
my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abercrombie & Fitch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead
, Glocks spit
Pour some juice out
 
for those in Manchester, Beaumount
Otisville, Lewisberg, Fort Dix, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain
 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne
 then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery,
 growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away
, zonin' grey, GT, 
Diesel
 jeans
Airs
 and 
Chucks
, 
solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some 
Pretty Tone
 shit, 
haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we 
don't give a flyin' 747 fuck
 though
Stayin' on my hus-tle
*beat change*
[Verse 2: Nas]
A message to those who trapped us up, from federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough, lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast
, 
look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens
, even the 
Congo
 
needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry, and I'm not gon' just stand and watch you die
I'mma pass you a .9, I'mma grab your hand -- come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king, who murdered the Christ
The same regime
, what God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate, man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres, plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours
, 
Street's Disciple
, 
revelations

[Produced by No I.D.]
[Verse 1: Nas]
You cocked back
You thought you had it planned, you thought you had your man
He saw you coming, he ran when you tried to blast that man
You missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of em pull through but one didn't, son's finished,
 
you took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standing next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a
[Hook: Nas]
Accident murderer, act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of em, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer
[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We grew up doing graffiti,
 
now hollow heads getting heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly getting weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But fuck em all, we balling 'til they come lock us up
20 to life; I'm clubbing, blowing 20 tonight
We the mob, Bob Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a TEC off the shelf,
 
live forever; that's Insh'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims are for show, killer
You niggas accidental, shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your tithes, stay alive, can't be dodging my clique
Cut a check; I use your bitch for some bargaining chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control,
 
God forgives and I don't
[Hook]
[Bridge: Nas]
Accident murderer
Accident murderer, you just an accident murderer
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha, we miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessing
Tell me who you impressing
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playing wrestling
Watch em grow to a man, I see them now they repping
But they cold-blooded, homie, wondering where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they're killing, they're reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Think of my nigga Drawz,
 
but you aren't a name to me
You ain't mean to kill him,
 it wasn't necessary
[Hook]

[Nas]
First I see a flashin' light, then on my own
I hear nothin', the smell of fire in brimstone
I feel hundreds arms grabbin' me, fallin' down the hole
Is it because there is no Gravity my body leaves my Soul
Is the Devil mad at me? will I go to Hell?
Or is it Heaven that awaits me?, is too early to tell
Is it now that I'm to be judged?
Will I face thee bright tunnel warm lights?
Will embrace me before force takes me
Like I'm movin' through high winds
See my self in baby carriages, relatives and friends
Things manifest, kings from every planets rest here
Beams of light hear the voice of the Nazareth near
[Hook: Nas]
You 'Amongst Kings' from both far near land
Made in my image son of God son of man
You came in the spirit for I am that I am
Father of all worlds Fallen Angel and the Lamb
[Nas]
Seen my body layin' down in the ground
It was painless, didn't feel a thing
Shots ring felt the anxious to get up and run
I was atheist, committed Suicide
I wish I could erase this shit
I seen a new life before the Christ
He created night & day, the sun & moon
From the virgin woman's womb
We lookin' down at my body, emergency room
Doctors frownin' at me surgical performs, I'm doomed
It's my day of judgment, eternal peace & fire
Far past the stars far past the Orion
I asked that you forgive father, I was tryin'
Many thrones in the light but only one's truly shinin'
[Hook]
[Nas]
Faster then the blinkin' eye, is the master and I
Face to face (uh) fightin' my case so we debate (where?)
Countin' all my sins (ok), where do we begin
When I stabbed the man in the train station or drunk gin
When I grabbed the man let the shells hit him from the Mac 10
It was all retaliation, (from what?) from way back then
Now I got the black Benz (and) trips from Aspen (and)
Disney World for my little girl and I'm askin'
You would recognize all the good deeds I'm worth (Dear God)
Send me on a trip God please the Earth
So I can deliver thou want it, stop playin'
He gave me life, I screamed out loud that 
"I Am..."
(Nas... 
Nastradamus
)
[Outro: Nas]
And I saw another mighty angel come down from Heaven (I Am)
Clothe wit the cloud (Nastradamus)
And the rainbow was upon his head as a Crown (I Am)
And his face was lit as were the Sun (I Am)
And his feet as pillars of fire (Nastradamus)
And his name was Nastradamus (I Am)
(I Am Nastradamus)

What the hell...what the hell...

People know me on these streets player, I ain't new
Lookin at me all funny, while I'm countin my money
Suprise, what I do is already legalized
Analyze what I toss across, ain't no love lost
[Jay-Z]
Fo' sure, everythings for dough now
Flow, you gotta pay a little more now
It's platinum, now a days we put the gold down
We stepped it up, y'all don't ever want a showdown
Get wetted up by the sleeve that leave the Bezzle out
Y'all don't like it? Sue me, fuck I'll settle out
Ghetto'd out in the vehicle Bent
These days I mellowed out, see success make a fella content
Uh-huh, you know, this rap star, Papi Chulo
Jay-Z, Hugo, of course player you lost player
I know you rappers wanna see me fail
But quick to see a 600SEL V-Twelve
Live wit it, y'all got dough to get get it
I got mine, your little bit of money couldn't stop mine
Your block time, too hot, too many hands in your pie
Seventy thirty, the nigga you work for work for me
Bottom line
[Hook 2 - Jay-Z]
People know me on these streets and the towns I been through
Lookin at me, stay focused, I'm givin em straight poker suprise
What I do is already legalized
Analyze how I floss of course, ain't no love lost
[Lord Tariq]
We be the Bronx to BK'lyn
, togethor we about a ton or better
On the way in, we rhyme related, very underestimated
That's why I'm winnin in this world of sins
Steady grinnin, money boss spendin
Distant from dirty women, Lord, I'm quite influencial
Spiritualy and mental, what you into I done been through
Preachin my words and don't know what you owe
It shows you wanna be me, but won't show it
Ain't nothin changed, but players, the game remains the same
I had a ten year run, hey I can't complain
Took the next step see, from Coke to Pepsi
From the bx weed
, 
ridin the south beach on jet-ski
Play to survive, 
you ain't live you just livin
You breathin a good one, but where I'm from, y'all forbidden
Come around, bad decision, you rather be in prison
Ain't' no duckin what I'm deliverin won't be forgivin in
Layin there shiverin, half the night
You gotta walk toward the light, everything is aiight
I make sure everything you endure stays tight
Big (*boom*) Lord Tariq, Jay-Z, outta sight
[Hook 1]
[Nas]
I spend nights on corners, see the crack
, cop my first Mac
No longer scared to pump what y'all pump, now I burst back
It hurts that, don't seem 
C.R.E.A.M
 
can make my purse fat
Without the benefits of a doubt, I hit the hearst black
But curse that, tryin to see Nas was your worst match
Blowin like Tahitii, throw off NYPD
Am I greedy? Like Amin Idi see me
In a fly 
Salinii
 gimme frames 
in
 the beanie
I flip my loot twice a week on 
my most trifest streets
You got no right to eat by the laws of life you keep
Ain't no love lost, none taken, none givin'
Stressin how I'm livin it, thinkin when my loot first came
Look what I did with it,
 
bought my click glaciers
And pagers
, rollin ten deep to Las Vegas
Copped a live croc, chopped it up, hit my block off
Wit gators, feedin peoples, from the bridge to Dequatas
But now, two years five months and 30 days later
I still put out the street flavor
But watch that kid right there, a bulge in his night wear
Awoke me up the ways I used to be in my heist years
Bubble eye small fry loaded four five
Just thirstin for some person with shine to just walk by
Now that I can see the 360,
 now that its me thats jiggy
Them cooly heads they wanna stick me, whoa

[Intro: Damian Marley]
Now greetings to the world
And to the intelligence of mankind
Is what makes us special among all other species
Everything is beautiful if found congregation before it
[Hook: Damian Marley]
These ancient thoughts
This ancient love
These ancient hearts
These ancient souls
These ancient songs
These ancient people
These ancient thoughts
This ancient love
These ancient hearts
These ancient souls
These ancient hopes
These ancient people
[Bridge: Damian Marley]
Like the earth, and the sky
And the sea, and the birds
And the trees, and the sun
Melody
Like a mountain, like a valley
Like the river, like the lake
Like the earth, when it quakes
Space and sea
[Verse 1: Nas]
This is rock and roll meets aristotle
I fly those G5's through the skies to Cabbo
Martial arts more ancient than Tae Bo
Swordsman, more ancient than Zorro
Ancient like the pharohs or priests of Yoruba
Or Obeah euphobia you peril
Your paths narrow like climbing mount Kilimanjaro
Ancient men traded cattle
Before columbus was lost in travel
, 
ancient canoes got paddeled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camo-flage
Chief before sarge, or lieutenant
Village elders before the senate
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st amendment
In the beginning, the drum was the text sending
There was moons before months, and time before minutes
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
From love, onto language, onto hieroglyphics
The Invention of the wheel, onto mathematics
The almanac, the calender, onto geographics
Herbal medicine, to anti-biotic Ginseng to acetonic
Water pump, water pump, to onto hydrolics
Moonlight, candle light, onto electronics
Instinct to knowledge, classroom to college
Oh, all of These ancient thoughts
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Junior Reid]
Man a Bust the earth, man a Bust the sky
Junior Gong, and Junior Reid we meditation it so high
Man a trod the gravel, it dirty and it dry
Oh, dem no see no wings, but man a fly
Babylon fi splurt, dem no know what life is worth
Oh, tell dem stop polluting mother earth
Man a make a trot, me robe, me sandles and me rod
Dem shouldve known, hear say man this man a God
[Hook]

[Verse 1 - Nas]
If Macy's don't have it
A hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around
Or I'm wasting fabric
I don't feel great until my plushest pieces
Cause you to suck your teeth
Some mean-mugging on my clean thugging mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry writing Russian
Ice disgusting. I started bling
How could you question my direction?
I'm king, I'm cultured, not just cause of
The foreign movie posters, the frames
Starring French names, look closer
? to the worm food
I despise and watch fake wise guys who turn stool
And speak highly of late made guys who once ruled
Hard-bottomed shoes
, 
chauffeurs flaunt ambrosia
My baby moms wrote a book that couldn't harm a soldier
Muhammad Ali hobbies, no pilates, jogging, jumping rope
Til my body cut up like a bag of dope
And hope I die ?
[Hook - Nas]
Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are
[Verse 2 - Nas]
Diggi-
diggi-dignitaries, Carhart congress
Fitted hat high rank officials
World Bank like Rothschilds
Take the wool from over your eyes
Who conspired to deceive you and I
It's easier for a man to believe a big lie
Than a small truth.
 
Money's not evil
It's the love of money that's the root
Not a luxury car worshipper, but I purchase
Particular vehicles, so me and my dudes, we can cruise
Upsetting policia They study my natural sleepy eye
To see if I'm high.
 I got my piece of the pie
My 40 acres is my 40 karats on my piece, that's fly
Carti bracelet, you talk that talk and walk that walk
You wouldn't understand our thoughts
How many black leaders are bought
Why the fuck you care if I rap about
How much my sneakers cost? I'mma floss
[Hook - Nas]
Worked too hard, stayed up too many nights
If I'm wrong for being me, I don't wanna be right
Nah! No not never, no not ever
I don't wanna be right, hood star, we are

[Hook]
I'm pregnant, don't know who the dad is
I'm happy, but this shit's the saddest
I'm maintaining, still keeping my status
Fuck what you haters say, my ass is still the fattest
Roll with the baddest, my girls in Gucci glasses
How could you pass this? Your loss
But I ain't tripping - I'm still the boss
I won't be another black girl lost
Lost, lost, lost, lost, Lost, lost
I won’t be another black girl lost
[Verse 1]
Brown and beautiful, black and stunning, light and delicious
Chocolate colored strawberry kisses and cherry lipstick
Very mystic, bald stitches her wig
Kinky curly and dread, goddess gon' grant my wishes
Tantalizing touches, succulent skin, we should wed
Start off broke then stay together 'til we make it big
My queen is english, Sojourner Truth, I could learn from you
Never Ike Turner you, but look what you turn and do like
Get out of order, you're not a supporter of my dream
Rich girl fantasy schemes, a good man she needs
But she young and she speeding, honey now, what's the reason?
You just met this nigga, think you owe him a fucking threesome
So you lustin' to have a baby by a Denver Nugget
You don't love him, you want security, baby, your bugging
Financial liberty you're after
, 
it's how you live
But the blood test shows it's not even his kid
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Chanel bags
, everything
She shopping every time she gets a wedding ring
This her 3rd marriage,
 
4 carats
Brand new Jag, deserves to have it
Temptation, she can't let go her dirty habits
Mid 30's, spendin' dough at Magic
She's dancin', romancin', she's up at Manson
She fucks all my mans, and they pop the 
magnums
So now what you gonna do, the morning-after pill is way overdue
'Posed to get married, now you embarassed
Who does this kid belong to?
Promiscuous, cuz' 
she got touched by step-dad
, 
sex at
Such a young age,
 if you was a virgin, I'd get mad
Sick society, blaming yourself so wrong
I highly respect you, bet that, strong, intelligent
This song ain't to poke fun of you, to get laughs
I just love you, really love you
Here for you, wanna trust you
Wanna cuff you, be my lady
But first, I gotta see the baby
[Hook]
[Outro]
Ladies, I believe in you
We gotta stop this craziness out here, though
We gotta get right
Because when we both get right, we both take flight
Us real men need you, for real

[Produced by Salaam Remi]
[Verse 1]
Rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica Queens in his black truck
Timbs was forty below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don’t die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don’t only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you, it’s foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money too
The fucking truth
Fucking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could’ve died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November thirtieth, another Queens king killed
It fucked me up, y’all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it
Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them Beems out, them M3’s out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors,
 eight street, twin buildings
Vernon
, can’t even count the Livingston children
Justice in 
Ravenswood,
 nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey’s ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo
Welcome home, Castro
Queensbridge unified all I ask for
Let’s do it for DU
Say what up to Snacks, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through
[Verse 2]
Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas’ rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team
On 118, my nigga Ben fly by like it’s a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock and Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks
, 
dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough
You all know how the story go
[Verse 3]
Any other real niggas in the world besides us, I ask
Probably is, but odds are we’ll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, 
I see you DU
Queens to the heavens,
 
salute the hood legends
Crack the Patrón, Hennessy and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories’ll get us through tomorrow
I’m a real OG cause back in nine-three
Niggas couldn’t fuck with me
Sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie’s gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now but you know I’m still mental but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling
[Verse 4]
Watch the calm realist channel his mom’s spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother’s here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me
, 
our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers
They act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain’t mean to murk him
Your gun’s a virgin
Better stay on point, if not it’s curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me probably
If music money didn’t stop me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I’m to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It’s the game that we was stuck with
Now I’m the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the top, but where the hustlers went
No familiar faces around, ain’t gotta grab the musket
It’s all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit
Bo cooking blow
, 
fuck is Slate at? Where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told you
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling

* Poems written by Shakur as ~ interpreted by other artists
{*singing in other language*}
[Danny Glover - over singing]
When your hero falls from grace, all fairy tales are uncovered
Myth exposed and pain magnified, the grace pays uncovered
He told me to be strong, but I confused to see it so weak
You say never to give up, and it hurts to see what comes to be
When your hero falls soley the stars, and so does the preception of tomorrow
Without my hero, theres only me alone, to deal with my sorrow
Your heart ceases to work, and your soul is not happy at all
What are you expected to do, when your only hero falls
[Afeni Shakur - over singing]
As long as some suffer, the river flows forever
As long as there is pain, the river flows forever
As strong as a smile can be, the river will flow forever
And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
..
..And as long as you are with me, we'll ride the river together
[Singing - over chanting]
We'll ride.. the river together, as long as.. you are with me
The river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me
The river.. will flow forever, as long as.. you are with me

[Intro]
You are who you associate with
Look around at your five closest friends
And that's who you are
If you don't want to be that person
You know what you got to do
[Hook]
Association breeds similiarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggers
'til six niggers carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man
But no man
Wants to die a poor man
With no plan
[Nas]
You try to kill me, but I come back
Hate me, that's a small thing
Demons let the sword swing and sever off my offspring
Bitches try to see me down, hugging the floor
Bullets pulling me, playing tug of war
With my body, gravity got me
Police want me arrested, just to see me naked
Snakes want my necklace, fake niggas make me set-trip
Thugs shooting wreckless
, everynight, niggas
Wonder, how will I exit from this life, niggas?
Think you a killer, get cement shoes in the river
You should watch them people with you
Let them street rules hit you
If you hang around snitches, you get judged for that
Cause you condone it, you know there ain't no love for that
There's slugs for that
Oh, you didn't know your man was talking?
That's why you stand with him, till you both land in the coffin
When you first heard he was snitching, then you should have thought
Everytime this nigga got caught selling, they let him walk
Early on a nigga was taught, stay away from them niggas
So a nigga like Nas got nothing to say to them niggas
I fuck with, only the trusted thug clique
Who really done shit, run up in your bitch, busting guns quick
[Hook]
Association breeds similiarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggers
'til six niggers carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man
But no man
Wants to die a poor man
With no plan
[Nas]
Some bitches lie a lot
They could be fly or not
Actresses cry a lot
Their girlfriends spy a lot
They can shake your hand, girl
Then they take your man, girl
The whole hood knowing
We got something good going
None of these hoes is after me
'Til they saw us happy
And that you bagged me
Now they wishing that they had me
So watch who you hang with
And who you cling with
You know these bitches ain't shit
They hoping to bank chips
With the baller after she done gave him some head
He never called her
He gang it and he left her for dead
Birds of a feather fly together
But chickens don't, they eat their own shit and die
And you affiliated, now you look weak
Cause your peeps is freaks
Credit card stealing hoes, well known in the streets
And they brought your down in the dirt
You was a pretty, young, smart thing
Going to work, I bet it hurt
Cause you had a clean rep
But the girls you seen with make these niggas say
"I bet that bitch suck a mean dick"
Word
[Hook]
Association breeds similiarity
That's why I'ma stay with real rich niggers
'til six niggers carry me
Poverty's a mind state
Time waits for no man
But no man
Wants to die a poor man
With no plan
[Stic Man]
A warrior walk alone, there's one spot on this throne
Fake friends be off and on, but a man stand up on his own
I'm raised by a different code, cut from a different cloth
Never been a follower, my momma told me be a boss
Watch who you hang around, don't let nobody bring you down
Friends come and go like seasons, leaves turn to brown
And some only come around when everything is green
Be careful not to let a snake infiltrate your team
For every Jesus there's a Judas, every Caesar there's a Brutus
If somebody tell you jump off a bridge -- are you gon' do it?
There's two types of influence: either healthy or deadly
Keep your circle small, away from all the hate and the envy
Don't come nowhere near me with it, I'm bullshit intolerant
My politics bosses up, for you black empowerment
I stay in my element, braveheart intelligent
Only associate with those for my betterment
I'm out for dead presidents to represent mines
Only click with my kind, my best friend is my grind
Everybody got big dreams, but few follow through
And it's deep: the company you keep become apart of you
Don't just be sitting around smoking weed letting time fly
If your homies don't inspire you to rise, tell them bye
You're better off dolo than rolling with a weak ass crew
I'm like Scarface: Who I trust? -- Me, that's who

Back to the grill again, the grill again
(Repeat x6)
[MC Serch]
You need a posse the size of the Nazis to attack this
And you're more optimistic than the Sounds of Blackness
Flip rhymes that rip through the chest cavity
And I keep going and going just like an Energizer battery
Flattery will get you nowhere, unless it's the 
derriere
And then it gets you everywhere
Went to the flea market, was in the car, parked it
Big fat blunts
, if you got it then spark it
And with the fisticuffs came the fists
And you've joined 
Steven Segal on the Marked for Death
 hitlist
Went back to the 70's and brothers got on grins
Cause they can step to some sisters and say "Slap me some skins
"Honeydip," and take 
the squad
 to the teepee
Hit it off, smoke a cig, watch a little TV
And if there ain't no papes there's no show
I'll just chill and return to kick 'em in the grill
[Hook]
[Red Hot Lover Tone]
Bust a style while I do it, if you know it oh you knew it
If you knew it then you knew it, if I catch a punk chewing
I'mma drop the flavor fluid on his head, yep I flew it
And like Aretha Franklin, your moms is jumping to it
So, so, so, where did you go, what did you know
SO many people want to be fly like Joe
G.I., E.I., oh lots and lots
And any rapper can top the Red Hot (Not!)
R&B rips hip-hop (Not!)
MC Serch is gonna flip-flop
 (Not!)
All my hoes look like sasquatch
 (Not!)
And George Bush gets enough props
Well, anyway, I'mma slay slay lay
Pull a ho around my way and make hooker souffle
Red Hot Lover Tone would like to thank MC Serch
Yo, you're chill for making me a part of history
Kicking em in the grill
[Nas]
Finesser, keep a Tec-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor,
 
keep you under pressure
Mind like a computer, the inserter
Paragraphs of murder, 
the nightclub flirter
This is Nas, kid, you know how it runs
I'm waving automatic guns at nuns
Sticking up the preachers in the church, I'm a stone crook
Serial killer, who works by the phone book
For you I got a lot to shoot my songs in here
My rhymes are hotter than a prostitute with gonorrhoea
On the mic I let vocabulary spill
(It's like that y'all) That y'all
, 
kick em in the grill
[Hook]
[Chubb Rock]
The Chubbsta breaks ?ya naughty? fakes, steady rate h
The panty mix the verse, looks to Serch, kick him in the grill again
Part 2, sequel of "The Dialect, The Derelict"
The murder licks, 
Vanilla kicks alive on the crucifix
Coming around the mountain, when he comes to sell more record bums
Digest the lyrics then you suck on some Tums
Crumbs with the energy from the lump sums
And lips to to the mixture to the friction and then you're humming
The door rings, yo I'm coming
To a theater near you, get your popcorn and your brew
And a Guiness Stout, check the clout when I'm about
Cause YOU are a BLABBERMOUTH
A blabber, it gets no badder
Lyrics on a diet cause it gets no fatter
Like a Gewn to the Guthrien, jumping up on the scene
With the Serches with the verses
Word up, the illustrious
Rapper dapper snapper fish, you want us to sell out your wish
My lips have never touched the circumference of a spliff
And if you see some coke or some spill
With some ill pill, yo kick me in the grill grill
[Hook]
[MC Serch]
So here's a true and false, tell me if it's factable
You wanna kill the Klan, shoot the fans a tractor pull
Got crazy game, so no one can stop me
But ayo, I'm white, I guess my game is hockey
Or basketball, football, taking papes in poker
If honeydip got a moneyclip I'm gonna stroke her
Wait a minute, chill chill, can't swing
Cause my girl ain't my girl no more, now she got a ring
Respect my wisdom like I respect myself
Try the G I'll put you in a tree like the Keebler elves
You couldn't be The Mack if you had the car, the hat, the ho
And your shit would still be out the back like a patio
Cause I saw you eating pig knuckles, with 
Frankie Knuckles
In a bar called Chuckles wearing name plate belt buckles
Goddamn your life is flimsy
Gave you enough respect, but gave it back cause I was stingy
So from the cons and pros to the pros and the cons
Call me a motherfucker I'll say "Yeah I fucked your moms"
Until she calls back I'm gonna chill
Peace to Red Hot Lover Tone, Chubb Rock, kick 'em in the grill

Ancient men traded cattle
Before Columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddeled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camoflage
Chief before sarge, our lieutenant

[Refrain]
You love to hear the story
How it all, how it all, got started, got started
Start it off, start it off, start it off
Back when, back when, back when, back when
Back when, back when, back when, back when
[Verse 1: Nas]
The ill reminisce and think about the fly days
Nothing like them 80's summer NY days
Hop on the MB5 days
Mopeds, 
Pro Keds
, 
city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now I chill in resorts, enjoying massages
Check out the oracle bred from city housing
Nas, I arise the dead by thousands
I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi
Hollis had Run and them but I proudly
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid
You love to hear the story how it started
The bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet
Before there was an audience to watch us
I assure you there was a process
[Refrain]
[Verse 2: Nas]
To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers,
 
undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared
It would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king
I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon
For niggas who would burn in Hell
For Vernon; 10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic
I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw
My man Dion said Nas over-think the songs he writing
I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man
I got the Donism in me
I'm here to enlighten

Now we on our way
D boy drug dealer look
Billionaire
[Verse 1: Nas]
Bally shoes, Gucci sneakers
Pharrell's a pharaoh,
 
peep the features
Unlaced Adidas
Top of the world like pyramids in Giza
Fila sweats, 88 I rocked a mock neck
Carried a nine in my projects
Bucket hat EPMD cassettes
Now I'm smoking loud in Ibiza
Mix the D'USSE with the reefer
My whole life is leisure
Gangsta lean like the Pisa
Eiffel Tower, Hermes towel
The Feds is perched like an owl
Real niggas all feel the hook
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Jay Z]
What you know about going out, head west
Maybach, 3 TV's all up in the headrest
Mace niggas at Madison Square Garden
20 million sold and we still catching charges
Rope chains, Rakim and Eric B
Bought my sidekicks Suzuki Jeeps and Cherokees
Hoop earrings,
 
coupes with the rear cameras
Put that bitch in a cherry M3
I'm not your average dope dealer
Silver Toyotas four runners and four wheelers
Me and Teflon Q45 infinite
Windows tinted, white girl all in it
Britney, bitch
MCM seats buck 50 stitch
Versace plates got the Basquiat
Collab from Versace's place
Cuban link 5 kilo
Your life is illegal when your chain can get the rico
Real niggas all feel the hook

Turn your radios up
You are now allowed to listen to the radio
The real niggas are back on the radio
[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, no slackin', no beggin', no askin', no fastin'
No disrespect to Islam nor Imam or Pastor
No answers to questions the media's askin'
Why we fight each other in public in front of these arrogant fascists?
They love it; puttin old niggas verse the youngest
Most of our elders failed us, how could they judge us? Niggas
There's verbal books published by niggas, produced by niggas
Genuine niggas, so I salute my niggas
Not mad cause Eminem said nigga, cause he my nigga
Wigga,
 
cracker
, friend -
 
we all black within, okay?
We all African, okay
Some Africans don't like us no way!
A killng happened in Johannesburg, yesterday
Slain artist named Lucky Dube, hijacked
Some say 
N-double A-C-P
, keep us sidetracked
But I don't buy that
, I buy 
Aston Martins
Faster cars than, NASCAR cars
 and, sparkin while ridin
Critics, eat a dick! Journalists see I'm rich
With this N-word jargon I'm just starting, bitch!
[Hook]
I'm a nigger, he's a nigger, she's a nigger, we some niggers
Wouldn't you like to be a nigger, too?
To all my kike niggers, spic niggers, guinea niggers, chink niggers
That's right, y'all my niggas, too
I'm a nigger, he's a nigger, she's a nigger, we some niggers
Wouldn't you like to be a nigger, too
They like to strangle niggers, blamin' niggers, shootin' niggers, hangin' niggers
Still you wanna be a nigger, too? True
[Verse 2: Nas]
Wake up in the morning, shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on the nightstand
, I'm the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against, patience, I'll get you
If that means I can't sleep a whole year, I'mma get you
I'm official not "A-Tisket" or "A-Tasket"
I'll put you in the casket, with the biscuit or the ratchet
They smoke hibiscus, they plants or trees, advanc-ed weed
Don't forsake us, you all are fake bloods like move make-up
I flow tighter as Tootie's braces
, who be hatin us?
I be on a state bus in shackles if my .8 bust
Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I'm the shit for ages, my clique still real QB gangsters
Clique still movin' like Freemasons
So if I'm on the flow for the law, there's lodges all across the nation
Nas is bred for the plan, to hold the Grand
Dragon's head in my hand
, come and get me, here I am

[Intro:]
Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...
[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind
[Hook: Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
[Verse 2:]
They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga ain't ugly!"
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...

[Hook]
(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba
[Verse 1]
I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it by your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga
 while we listen to 
Faith
I'm feeling richer today
I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'mma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the lord
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'mma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on top of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to fuck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
Cause you're a big girl now
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You fuck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say "Oh God"
Every ho that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, Ironically
You pop up
, 
throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl see the world is yours
[Hook fade out]

[Verse 1]
Get yours nigga
Cuz I'mma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to y'all
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killas crawl
And snitches call police
All these niggas and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces
 
& startin' drama
 
and
Shootin' niggas in cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the 
fo' pound
 
go nuts
Betta slow up
Before you get your ass blown up
Nigga never gonna grow up
Drinkin' the Henney
But he know he gonna throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? The future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted & ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace chasin' the papas
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things
[Hook]
I ain't fuck with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
Cuz now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna rhyme wit you
Cuz now I'm into big things
You know I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things
Nah, I can't fuck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna stand on the corner
I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
[Verse 2]
When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists
 but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style I'mma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of y'all can't come close to?
Some of y'all
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when y'all niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I'm glad y'all stopped and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga now
Rocks are glistenin'
Can't stop my mission
Make anotha LP drop
I'm hittin'
With the new shit exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the 
dough
Is y'all bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I go past y'all
Y'all got the glass jaw
And when I hit it, admit it
Y'all on ya ass y'all
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gunnin' for dough
You want to score
But you really don't know how to to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me
Is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out
Where ya clique now
Where you sit now
In the back seat
Mad cuz I flip styles
And I pack heat
Make you run laps
Like a pro athlete
An' I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
I'mma tell you what's real
An' what could stop you from makin' a mil
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high wit you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
Cuz they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me
I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown off Berry Gordy
Good God
[Outro]
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
Cuz now I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
Cuz now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things
Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

I can't believe it's been a year since i wrote that/Was lost in thought figuring out the roadmap/
How can i live another year to get where Hov's at/It's not my fault my heart done chose rap/
My brothers know that, i'm the type to hold back...but now i'm on a track open up 'bout all of that/All of that coke rap that could've fucked my conscience/I grew up on that era where the big word was "Abortion"/And AIDS, back then it was the "Gay cancer"/Backstage with the DJ or the breakdancer...it's just staged, your image like the fake gangster/You dont move weight, you just Sway...you don't get Yé answer/You don't get that (x2)...your story's like money to me, i dont get that!/The industry is funny to me; my smile been cracked/All you rappers on the same box, waitin' for a big check...from the exec', to be exact/You really wanna ball then be prepared to get sacked
At school i was lame, bitches said i'm too nerdy/I really got no game but the dame was so flirty/Snow flurry...I only pray one day that the draw rain/Pussy draw attention, get the picture that i'm drawing/
When it rain, it pours... When it rain in my city, people die, you can't ignore the cause
/Y'all wearing Michael Kors, y'all can come to my city if you ain't scared to die; them kids'll fuck you...pause/Rob your ass, i ain't talking no massage/Get you gas'd, i ain't talking no garage/
Get you guessed if i ain't into no menage/I'm a Christian boy, i hope you get the message/
Excuse my french though, i'm really trilingual...single, heterosexual; meek like an angel

[Intro]
[Girl 1] HELLO?!
[Girl 2] Whassup girl
[G1] Ain't nothin - this nigga in here stressin
Talkin that old off the wall 
back to Africa
 shit again
[G2] What, that 
God Body
 shit?
[G1] Yeah, that dumb shit
I'm tryin to get up OUTTA here
[G2] I hear that.. but yo, you know the spot is pumpin tonight
[G1] Word f'real where?
[G2] 
You know, where the real niggas is poppin the Cristal
Not that White Star!
[G1] Ha hah! Word where the real niggas at?
[Jo-Jo Hailey]
Listen.. to reason
Pretty baby baby listen
[Verse 1]
A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style
 
link rockin
, then 
mink
 coppin
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin
The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel lookin real
, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales,
 heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, 
your ebony tone is lockin me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man
; 
but you juggle
Way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on
Niggas pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggas thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave
What up mah, frontin like you naive
Push your man's whip, calling police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!
[Hook: Jo-Jo Hailey]
Diamonds all shinin, lookin all fine
Pretty little face, get a little high
Young girl stugglin, tryin to survive
Mother of the Earth, she made you and I
Just tired of playin the same ol' games
Messin with my mind, emotional thangs
And there goes.. a black girl.. lost
[Verse 2]
Like 
Isis
, 
she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
To who'sever gettin down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceles
s
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours
Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you
Igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen
To this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Comin home wantin more from a college degree
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Where are you focused, on legit niggas and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggas, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
Could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to
More than the world, but not knowin nothin about you
You leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to
Drop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancin topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a
 
black girl lost
[Outro: Jo-Jo Hailey]
You should be ashamed of yourself
The way you carry yourself
The way you hang out all night long
Doin silly things that is wrong
Black girl

[Intro - Barack Obama - taken from victory speech in Iowa]
They said this day would never come
They said our sights were set too high
This country is too divided, too disillusioned
To ever come together around a common purpose. They said
[Hook]
"Although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready, to have a black president"
Yes we can
 
change the world, the world, the world
[Verse 1 - Nas]
They forgot us on the block, got us in the box
Solitary confinement:
 
how violent are these cops?
They need a early retirement
How many rallies will I watch? I ain't got it in me to march
I got a Semi to spark, the game's in a drought
Public housing, projects, cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my clique, either getting money
Or running from homicide trail, that's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich, still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius, to whoever may need it
I bleed this from 
Queensbridge
, 
now living with my feet up
Never defeated, so a president's needed
You know these colored folks and Negros hate to see
One of their own succeeding
America: surprise us and let a black man guide us
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Nas]
What's the black pres' thinking on election night?
Is it: "How can I protect my life? Protect my wife? Protect my rights?"
Every other president was nothing less than white
Except Thomas Jefferson had mixed Indian blood.. and Calvin Coolidge
KKK is like: "What the fuck?!", loading their guns up
Loading up mine too, ready to ride
Cause I'm riding with my crew - he dies, we die too
Yeah, but on the positive side
I think Obama provides hope and challenges minds
Of all races and colors to erase the hate
And try to love one another.
 
So many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinking I can trust this brotha
...but will he keep it way real?
Every innocent nigga in jail gets out on appeal
When he wins, will he really care still?
I feel
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Nas]
Say a prayer for "Do we have to?"
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
Sincerely yours, USA's most brave rapper
Jesse carjacker, Uncle Tom kidnapper
Ask around: 
Bentley coupe
 
off the Richter
Bitch called "Life": I pimped her, what
Politics, politricks, Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense, progress-producer
Nothing on the stove, a survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through to help
Anything we need done, gotta do for self
New, improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60s again, niggas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies; ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty
[Hook]
[Outro - 
Governor Bill Richardson

It is my distinct honor, and privilege to introduce
The next President of the United States - 
Barack Obama

[Intro: Jay-Z] & (Nas)
I know you can feel the magic baby
Turn the motherfuckin lights down
Esco whuttup? (Whuttup homey)
I mean.. it's what you expected ain't it?
Let's go... uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Turn the music up in the headphones
Uh, Yea, that's perfect (Yea, right)
Uh, we got to take our time and make a nigga wait on this motherfucker
(hahaha!) Make niggas mad and shit like
Niggas usually just start rappin' after 4-bars, nigga go in
Start dancin' in this motherfucker
Yea, (Yea) we just come outta nowhere
[Hook: Jay-Z]
I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like "Fuck it then"
[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then
 (What?)
Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
We had covenant, who would of thought the love would end
Like Ice Cold's album
, 
all good things
Neva thought we sing the same song that all hood sang
Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
You wouldn't bicker like the other fools talk good game
Neva imagine all the disasters that one good reign
Could bring!, should blame, the game, and I could
It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
And foreva be in debt, that's neva a good thing
To the pressure for success can put a good strain
On a friend you call best, and yes it could bring
Out the worst in every person, even the good and sane
Though we rehearsed, it's just ain't the same
When you put in the game at age sixteen
Then you mix things: like cars, jewelry, and miss things
Jealousy, ego, and pride, and this brings
It all to a head
 
like coin, cha-ching
The root of evil strikes again, this could sting
Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
This puts the ring in jeopardy - indefinitely
[Hook: Jay-Z]
[Hook: Nas]
I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, "fuck it then"
[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm back in the hood, they like, "Hey Nas" (Uh)
Blowin' on purp', reflectin' on they lives
Couple of fat cats,
 
couple of A.I.'s
Dreamin' of fly shit instead of them gray skies
Gray 5's, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
Pitch, sling pies,
 
and niggas they sing, "why"?
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
Weak minds, keep tryin', follow the street signs
I'm standin' on the roof of my building
I'm feelin' - the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin' 80 proof
, 
bulletproof under my attire
Could it be the forces of darkness, against hood angels of good
That forms street politics
 - 
makes a sweet honest kid
Turn illegal for commerce - to get his feet out of them Converse
That's my word
[Hook: Jay-Z]
[Hook: Nas]

[Verse 1: Saul Williams]
I used to hump my pillow at night
The type of silent prayer to make myself prepare for the light
Me and my cousin Duce would rank the girls between one and ten
And the highest number got to be my pillows pretend
Now I apologize to every high ranker
But you taught me how to dream and so I also "Thank Ya"
I never had the courage to approach you at school
We joked around a lot and I know you thought I dressed cool
But I was just coverin' up
All the insecurities that came bubblin' up
My complexion had me stuck in an emotional rut
Like the time you Flavor flaved me and you called me "Yo Chuck"
They say "I'm too black man", I think I'm too black
Mom, do you think I'm too black?, I think I'm too black
I think I'm too black, I think I'm too black
You're black, you're black, you're black, you're black
[Hook: Saul Williams]
Black Stacey, they called me Black Stacey
I never got to be myself, cause to myself I always was..
Black Stacey, in polka dots and paisley
A double goose and bally shoes, you thought it wouldn't faze me
I was Black Stacey, the Preachers' son from Haiti
Who rhymed a lot and always got the dances at the party
I was Black Stacey, you thought it would was a phase
But it did, cause I was just a kid
[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, Black Jesus help us - Muhammad (pbuh) guide me
Like Otis Blackwell, wrote hits for Elvis
Made my pen write, my insight as wisely
In flight, she five feet massage, plus got Kelis beside me
Yves St-Laurent shades, Dom P's, entrees
Land where there's palm trees
Louis luggage, truly love it
Truly covered in fragrance, from blazin' that stinky
Rubies like Diallo, red blood on my pinky
I peep this treatment I'm gettin', they actin' real funny
Like I don't belong here, but I'm spendin' real money
And they turnin' up their noses at us, like they can't stand us
Like I ain't a King, so I'm callin' up the Manager
Here comes this black dude, guess they've sent him to handle us
Have the nerve to say - "they don't tolerate no animals"
WHAT?, a sellout coon, he black like me
So we got the hell out the room, I roll with Black Stacey
[Verse 3: Saul Williams]
Now here's a little message for you
All you baller playa's got some insecurities too
That you could cover up, bling it up, cash in and cha-ching it up
Hope no one will bring it up, lock it down and string it up
Or you can share your essence with us
Cause everythin' about you couldn't be rugged and ruff
And even though you tote a Glock and you're hot on the street
If you dare to share your heart, we'll nod our heart to its beat
And you should do that, if nothin' else, to prove that
A player like you could keep it honest and true
Don't mean to call your bluff, but motherfucka that's what I do
You got platinum chain then, son, I'm probably talkin' to you
And you can call your gang, your posse and the rest of your crew
And while you're at it, get them addicts and the indigent too
I plan to have a whole army by the time that I'm through
To load their guns with songs they haven't sung, like..
[Hook: Saul Williams]
Black Stacey, they called me Black Stacey
I never got to be myself, cause to myself I always was..
Black Stacey, in polka dots and paisley
A double goose and bally shoes, you thought it wouldn't faze me
I was Black Stacey, the Preachers' son from Haiti
Who rhymed a lot and always got the dances at the party
I was Black Stacey, you thought it would was a phase
But it did, cause I was just a kid

[Nas]
Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be telling you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
Know you a young single parent out struggling, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killing shorty future, I wonder how do we last it?
Underground in they casket, ancestors turning
I'm learning something every day,
 
there is no Lazarus
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggas is chilling, getting high, relaxing
Envisioning, owning shit, yo it can happen
What do we own? Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give my brother a loan
What do we own?
 
The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
For reparations
, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So stop being controlled, we black zombies
[Hook: *sung*]
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
Walking talking dead, though we think we're living (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, following the system (black zombies)
[Nas]
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, fuck behind bars
We've already gone insane
We've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
Without fulfilling reality;
 
too greedy and
Can't have one or two chains, we need three of them
Can't have one or two guns without squeezing 'em
On our own people and,
 
fuck black leaders
Cause whites ain't got none leading them,
the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophet
Let's all get down and get up
Victims walking 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Fainting, shouting, catching Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doing it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demonstrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies
[Hook]
[Nas]
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggas with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
Or from Israel,
 
Bismillah al rahman al rahim
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
Peace against the darkness, which is unGodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tomorrow
{*roaring*} ..
 
that's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie
[Hook]
[Nas]
Wake up! Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggas won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
When you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggas..

[Verse 1: K'La]
Promise to give, Promise to love
But you broke up promises
Just like you broke my trust
Never again,I won’t hurt again
I promised myself never to love another man
[Hook: K'La]
You promised you'd love me, love me, love me
You promised you’d stay, you’d stay
But I don’t feel the same
You’re the one to blame
Why I act this way
You’re the one to blame
Why I think this way
You’re the one to blame
Blame,blame,blame
You’re the one to blame
Blame,blame,blame
[Verse 2: K'La]
Who would’ve tought, I’d end up this way
Stepping on hearts and throwing love away
But you can’t hate the player you gotta hate the game
And I know it hurts to see the monster that you made
[Hook: K'La]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Our face cold, with great shoulders by the waist I hold her
Her only mistake is I caught her rocking takeover
She cooks steak I’m not a carnivore it’d be kind of raw
But the wine is fine,I’m mature and be times that’s all woman
Have better talks my teenage daughter
Then we have and you a grown woman
So I be vague when I answer questions
About my life or hustlin’, I know you used to first dates
But dudes be all the fun and had this,they want that
Did time and fucked that, beat this they know people
Connections and all that
You tied up but let’s try intellectual higher subject
Like metaphysics or the science of it
That is corny also, let’s talk about you being my lawful
But nah, not just yet, maybe later we just met
But for now, I need to keep you around
‘Cause this the most perfect all I found in a while
[Hook: K'La]

[Verse 1]
Blaze a 50, sit back
 in the 
drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, 
this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy,
 
from Miami
Masseuse,
 
wedding ring on,
 
loving Celine Dion
Hate rap,
 
told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party
Had the 
Henny,
 
sipped it up
 with 
Terrell Davis
MVP,
 
we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out,
 
flossing
 with 
Stoute,
 he had the 
gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell
 said 
her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite
 washing her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hitting it raw,
 
tasting it,
 
wilding out of my character
Taping it,
 
Tyra Banks face with Faiths lips
Giving head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the la to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course,
 
wears Le Coq Sport
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adapting
P-11's,
 
ACP shells for blasting
Caught him with his spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burning her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance
His maid cried "No", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million,
 
he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London,
 
goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought "What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision"
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet again
[Verse 2]
Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fastlane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screaming "Yo, we almost crashed!"
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death

[Hook]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 2x]
[Kelis]
Told him what I like
When he heat it up at night
Made him stand behind my door and watch me (uh uh uh)
And I couldn't believe the type
He was saying all the right
Whispers gettin' mami right, I was (uh uh uh)
So I had to get the ice
Homie wanna fly the kite
Had to show him what a pro I was (uh uh uh)
I was headed for the light
He refused to take a bite
Till I put my blindfolders on
I'm saying something like
[Bridge]
You just taking it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me
[Hook]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 4x]
[Kelis]
Hold up
Let me take this off
Just to see where I can catch my breath at all
Hold up
You got a pretty strong team
Got somethin on the bench that Kelis ain't seen
Hold up
Why you treat me like that
Bout the 3rd or 4th time you ain't had to do that
Hold up
Won't you let me cheat once
And I promise you won't never make me keep this on
[Bridge]
You just taking it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me
[Hook]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 4x]
[Nas]
The last thing you get
Is a blindfold and a cigarette
You willing to bet
Like an ocean cruise
Mami, I'm so addictive
How long I('ve) been stroking you gives you motion sickness
Grant your wishes
I leave you four senses
Smelling, feeling, tasting, and hearing
One minute I'm gone
Next I'm reappearing
The bed is the bentley
I'm doing the steering
I got your eyes in the veil
With your hands all over my tattoos
Like your reading the braile
Like my wine
With a spicy aftertaste
Though you fine
I like to cover up half your face
If you blind and can't see
What I'm bout to do
The suspense so intense won't allow you to move
Gonna surprise you
Like Hugh Grant in 8 and a half weeks
Kelis and Nasty
[Bridge]
You just taking it all, what's gon' be left for me
I told you get it, but you're taking it all from me
[Hook]
When he want it he blindfolds me
Then I get sexy on him, get sexy on him, like
[Repeat 8x]

Italiano motto
Train like Cus D'Amato
Guard your plant
Recline low black milano
Blessed God feelin kosher
One in the top of the toaster
???
My nine is stuck in a holster
Dump quick
Chasing my dick
Made a bum bitch rich
Stalefish
Heard she naked in jail flicks
Mamacita
Black widow turned to be a back seater
Satin pillows a pimpstress in willow
Cookin my blow and heads low
Eye swellin
The son of the grain
I gotta split my wife's melon
So I can see the seven seeds of my circumference
Beaver lunged it
Polishin pistols at the gunsmith
Clever
My mama told me take cheddar
Buy slugs or drugs whatever calculate better
When cakes measured
Lock the front door secure
See the gleaming white crystal when its pure
Fuck the snake hoes and jealous ass niggas
That smash your Benz windows
Detecting fake niggas signals
Yo live niggas get it too
Scarin rappers like the fed time Gotti was acquitted to
Bloodshot red eyes, high
Yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Kicks matchin my shit my gun on
Thinkin of names for my mans unborn
Spill the Puerto Rican rum on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints scream religious praise
Heat grazed the baby yo
Foul shit made a welfare mom crazy
More bodies drop by the ratio
Paces flow
Grisly thoughts for makin dough
Haitian bitch cast a spell on my life for cash flow
So now its on never wasted a slug
Time is money
When it comes to mine
Take it in blood

(Nas talking)
I heard that nigga Capone's home yo
...word to Motha..that nigga Nore'
Doin' his mothafuckin' thing...thugged out
Entertainment...knowwhatI'msayin'?, niggas still in the streets...Ill
Will, Braveheart nigga, there's a thin line between streets and
Business..so we gotta have balance and be easy...
Verse 1: (Nas)
I heard you fags wanna catch me off guard
Put Techs to my heart, the death of Escobar
Under your breath, whispers in the dark
I hear it cause the street ain't loyal to choose sides
Prepare for the beef, whoever lose dies
Rich and I'm thuggin'
I can't trust nothin', this bitch that I'm fuckin'
This clip that I'm bustin' could jam in my fist
Look at my hand, finger pussy with expensive rings
Cut coke cookies, wrote poetry
And broke noses B
The voice from Heaven
I'm God sent, of course a legend
This is part 1, speak my sermon, the hood reverand
Blunted eyes red
C-Class, a Hundred times Five Red
CD's blast, speed fast, haters drop dead
I'm gorgeous
Black Goddess flip the arm rest, flip the cordless
Her body stacks the best, ass is flawless
Finally the long awaited shit, ghetto people
The sequel
Nas, CNN, nobody's equal
Chorus
Yo, Be easy
Keep the club off the heezy
Straight thugs in the back, drink creezy
Be easy, but we still smoke treezy
See us rippin' the shows with thugged eezy
Verse 2: (Capone)
Niggas picked me the boss
Ricky Ross
Lex Two-Fifty Horse power, click and devour the source
If it's flour then swallow your loss
I cock Fours, kick in Poppi's doors
All for the cash and the cause
Niggas break big fractions of laws
So what, we got it sewn up, smack every cat on the board
I speak the truth, guns spit at you, shakin' my palm
It's pitiful, wavin' my wand
The Don, 
a Hundred follow me like Farrakhan
Chasin' my Henny, embrace Benny's
It's quite Frank, my niggas 'll kill, never waste a Penny
Money stay well invested
Feel the weight on my necklace
When death is too close flip the next shit
Thug the game out
Bust biscuits, pull the Range out
Public enemy, QueensBridge where I hang out
Sweet scent of weed I wear like a fragrance
My energy's kinetic, mind power type ancient
Chorus
Verse 3: (Noreaga)
I see death through the corner, die, kingdom come
Six 500's, pull up right in front of the slum
Sticky green fingers soldiers of the great God
Clarence spoke to the poor but he lived in Oz
An ill hook like Roy Jones, I'm a street corner bastard
And crush weed with the hashish
Bandana head dome wrapped
Caddy trucks with the grills and the chrome snaps
I'm on point like Al Sharpton, come peep the M.U. marksman
The S-Class is shittin' on your weak Datsun
Graffiti written on the Bible, my life is wicked
I see dead corpses, and Rolls Royces
Put your heart on your lap, listen you hear voices
My whole persona is the drama and to smoke skama
I can lift it up, Willy what in front of your slut
Money bustin out my pocket, your bank is stopped
Chorus

[Intro: Nas]
Yo, I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Haley got blazed
Before they told stories,
 I'mma get blazed before I tell y'all stories
I saw on TV today, this man lost his son, his son died
So he had him cremated, took his ashes and then made it
To a Diamond ring,
 
now he watches his son shine everyday
I just thought about that, while I sit here ashing in this ash tray, yeah
[Verse 1]
The making of a mad band, intricate stories of DeVante Swing
Ava Gardner,
 
the crashin' of James Dean
Bobby Brown influenced by Rick James
 and it goes
Prince wanted Alexander O'Neal to be Morris Day or Jerome
But Alex was putting coke in his nose, nigga whyling
Could be a myth but I swear that the source was close
Phyllis Hyman..killed herself
, it was crazy, mommy was bad they say
Donny Hathaway free fall from a balcony, he swings
[Hook: Nas]
As the blunt ash falls into the ash tray
I could see my whole life fly past me
Did I? Did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
And will the money and fame out last me?
The blunts ash falls down in the ash tray
Well I see my whole life fly past me
I'm asking did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy?
Did I? Anything else you wanna know, just ask me
[Verse 2]
Sam trusted Womack with his main lady
He tossing in the grave, like "This is how you repay me?"
A change gon' come, wish you didn't trust me so much
Marvin said "No mountain's high enough," fly stuff
David Ruffin was punching Tammi Terrell, gave her concussions
While the Funk Brothers was laying down the percussion
When Flo from the Surpremes died, Diana Ross cried
Many people said that she was laughin' inside
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
John F. Kennedy's
 enemies dealt with treachery, 
it interests me
Judy Campbell in Gucci sandals,
 she's what a temptress be
The death of Ennis Cosby, what a mystery
Or 
the Chicagoan Harold Washington,
 someone is sabotaging 'em
Watch out for the traps, 
Larry Troutman killed his brother
Roger Troutman then he killed himself, that's the end of Zapp
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats
This is what came from their pain from their hurt we gain, an unfair exchange
[Hook]
[Outro]
I could smell old bogey cigars
Long record perfumes
, smelling just as sweet
Me and my wife K, flying in a drop-top like Ruby and Ossie Davis baby
Know what I mean? Yo man, I get smoked out, and start thinking 'bout
Hattie McDaniel got a Oscar, for playing Mammy in Gone with the Wind
And she didn't get allowed, wasn't even allowed to go to the premier
Believe that? Couldn't go to premier to her joint
Man, you know they were strong back then man
Blunt from my ash tray, nothing gon' to live past me, yeah

Verse 1
(Noreaga)
Got out the mall yo

In my face askin can he see the grenade

Yo it's a small world ya know that we'll see him again
He said fuck you

(Nas)

(Noreaga)
Hey yo fuck it yo, I bucked him son
Cause he was on some stupid shit
Thinking he the real thing
When he was just a duplicate
Saying that he hate our clique
Hate our shit
Hate the Firm album and the CNN clique
He said he hate you and wish you ain't have a six
He had coliseum jewelry no tito tricks
(Nas)
That's what he supposed to get
Nigga play you close he gets hit
Laying in dirt for something you say you get hurt
Fuck around though, probably with some old school shit
How bad you hit him up god?
You he's ghost and shit?
Chorus
(Noreaga)
Yo it's a body in the trunk son
So what's it gonna be
A nigga layin dead cause he came for me
Yo it's a body in the trunk son
So what's it gonna be
A nigga layin dead cause he came for me
Verse 2
(Noreaga)
I had the Queens hoodie on wit the blood on my sleeve
Gave that nigga one offer he could take or he leave
But it's a body in the trunk son it's getting scary
What if police pull us over and smell that corpse?
Yo send it, go in the trunk light an incense
Spray the lysol all over the car
I know you wasn't dead then but you're hear now paul
Yo it happened like an hour or two
I showered wit boo
Wasted a little time
Didn't want to disturb you
(Nas)
For some reason yo I couldn't sleep
Yo slept with my heat
Yo you think you in some movie shit son?
I think you're losing it
Pop the trunk who's the kid?
You really had to buck him?
You couldn't just snuff him?
Yo he had to lose his wig?
Fuck you bring him here for?
What you think I could do?
Somebody could've followed you
Fuck it nigga I'll ride wit you
Some real niggas gonna do what we gotta do
Slide in this whip and we out
Empty the clip in his mouth fuck it
That's how we move in this game
Rulin this game
Niggas stayin true to this game
Chorus
(Noreaga)
Yo it's a body in the trunk son
So what's it gonna be
A nigga layin dead cause he came for me
Yo it's a body in the trunk son
So what's it gonna be
A nigga layin dead cause he came for me
Verse 3
(Noreaga)
Yo son I shot him in the parking lot
Right in the mall
If I would have left the body
The police would have crawled
Yo I did that
Chopped the body up
Fuck the chit chat
(Nas)
Kick back
(Noreaga)
I just lit up so here hit that
(Nas)
Pull over somewhere god
Where I could piss at
Pop the trunk let a nigga see who it is

Not now son maintain and stick to the biz

Yo son the way you're talking make it sound like y'all cool
Like you and this nigga used to go to school
Back in 204 son tell me its not
(Nas)
Yo pop chill the way he had his soul on the rock
He was on top
(Noreaga)
Locked from the bottom to top
Now this nigga just layin our trunk straight popped
We need a spot where we can dump him
Without no noise
My niggas ain't tryin to alert no boys

This ain't no game god
Dump his body in the train yard

Alchemist
 
you know me man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes right on the spot in the studio
Soon as I hear the track; you know what I'm sayin?
Word but I wanted to bring a couple of books to the studio today
Man I found these shits up in the crib man in boxes man
I don't even remember when I was writing these shits
Or what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man
Fuck it check it
How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man a O.G
Some niggas will conversate with liars all day
Time pass...(Nah lemme start somethin' else)
Soul on ice, death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is I'mma prince I'm against lames
Who do minor shit swear they on the top of they game
Ya rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue"
It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed
 
he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes
Oh shit Tina - I been lookin' for this bitch number damn
No this rhyme is weak..
This is weak I remember this bullshit right here
(My Book of Rhymes)
Gandhi was a... what the fu..?
Gandhi was a fool, nigga fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach ya plights of conquest
(I wonder when I wrote this. Nah it's weak)
The money's ya religion sky the limit live life
Numbers is big business makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy, knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for notoriety
Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbing my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liars and squares...
(Nah that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my 2way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci god poverty's real
I can't fight you cause you would sue me niggas be groupies
I see imitators trying to make albums spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit
I pump some
 
Rick James
 
with that
 
Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Scoob and Scrap
, this can't be
My book of rhymes
This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit!
(My Book of Rhymes)
Nah neva that fuck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?
Huh you a funny nigga... naw yeah
(My Book of Rhymes)
I'm tellin' you I'mma come up with some new shit now
Fuck that I'mma write again now fuck that
I musta been high on some shit mmm what the fuck is this?
Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood
Our values so low our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded
Cause now we need it
We older almost able t...
I'm jealous of you. How come you so beautiful?
Smelling fresh, youthful, intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit
Ayo, I envy you cause all you do is smile and things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention
I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant
(Kinda crazy)

[Intro] (Nas)
Yeah... ay yo Jungle... ay yo Wiz...
Come on man... Let's do this
It's a Braveheart party y'all
C'mon
[Hook] (Mary)
Throw your hands up cuz we wanna dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
Cuz this beat will rock your body
Get up on the floor and party
Now y'all tell me what y'all wanna do
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody
Get up on the floor and party
[Verse 1] (Nas)
I move at night, respect my gangsta
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right
The club is righteous
, 
tight with family
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky & nasty
Middle fingers up and say "Fuck the world"
Throw your hands up, they can't fuck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open
, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud
, 
and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out
Put yo hands up
Repeat Chorus
[Verse 2] (Jungle)
I pull in a 
V12
 drop all red
Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg
Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you
Show you what your body made for, you're official
You could be my baby mama lookin like that
What you drink, champagne or Cognac
What you like dancin diamonds, 
Dolce Gabbana
Fendi,
 
Louis Vuitton
, 
Gucci and Prada
A nigga like Jungle to always come thru
Shine in yo hood whenever the fuck you want to
Cause I'mma 
B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T
. from 
QB
Put'em up...
Repeat Chorus
Party all night (Party all night)
Let's drink, no fights (Let's drink, no fights)
Party all night (Whachu wan' do?)
Let's drink, no fights (Drink up...c'mon, yeah, yeah...)
[Verse 3] (Wiz)
I'm blaze, haze for days
Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid
Mac out corner I got it's all laid
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face
Now do she want me to touch her?
Or do she want me to see?
Fuck is she comin wit me
A true BHG Wiz, not complex
Chin checks if it get hectic
Nigga Braveheart respected
Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case
I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face
Throw yo hands up
Repeat Chorus 2X

[Hook]
In America you'll never be free
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe?
Braveheart
, still 
QB's Finest
Grinding, 
enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shining
, 
you can see a nigga breathe
Jewels enchanted like they was new from Atlantis
Cruise with the hammer
, 
jealous heart, they can't stand him
Haters are scandalous, damn, can't a nigga just breathe?
To all my niggas getting money in the streets
Middle fingers up, fuck the police
Light up my trees, and I just breathe
[Verse 1]
I twist 'em,
 
baby mama beef victim
Chronic leaf hittin',
 
all kinds of heat with him
, 
wisdom
From pot to piss in to high position
Intense hustle, it's pain like a pinched muscle
'Til it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
'Til I dodge enough shots,
 
and the presiding judge slams a mallet
And says life I'mma guap,
 then 
I cop
Then I yacht, Then I dock
Island hopping away from nightmare holders
Or cowboy slingers who shoot up any club
That see they names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on Ex or he coked up, suggesting I post a
Bail, I'm like yes, cause we soldiers
We just getting older, in time, we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest on my folder
Nigga breathe
(Chorus)
[Verse 2]
I'm fresh out of city housing, and have too many options
Pennies on a pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty henny in me
, 
envy was simply they trend, see
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me
The high life, the fly life
Pierre Hardy
, 
imitation of Christ
Ice-wear gaudy
, 
since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice, now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothin' less than a 740
With fresh linens, sip Pellegrinos with Airs on
They sick, mixing they water with airborne
[Outro]
Oh, they so sick!
Look how I got 'em going crazy, look at that!
You gotta let it out, stress...ain't good man
You gotta breathe
Breathe...
America, we gotta be free
Breathe... (x4)

*Nas talking*
"The light is there."
[Intro: Olu Dara singing]
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City,
 
where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir,
 
all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive
[Verse 1: Nas]
Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey --
Chuck Berry
 of these rap skits, 
styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost
, 
and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like 
Miles and Dizzy
, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap
 
from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' 
bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
[Verse 2: Nas]
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blue
s
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom,
 I drew pix to mess them up
Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, 
"Mr. Jones please come get your child
Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild"
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man - The great-greatest man alive
[Verse 3: Nas]
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to
[Olu Dara singing]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as 
Queenbridge
[Nas]
Nas, Nas you don't stop
Olu Dara in the house, you don't stop
Muddy Waters'
 
Howling Wolf you don't stop
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't stop
Tell 'em Pop
[Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing]
See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)
Where I had my first child (That's me)
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)
All the boys call him Nas
 (Luh ya, boy)
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive
 (You the greatest, Pop)
Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
Rest In Peace Ray Charles

Woke up in New York City lying on the floor
Just outside of Marcy's - West 54 "wow"
You gonna know my name by the end of the night "well"
You gonna know my name by the end of the night "well"
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
You don't care, no
Start up with the bottle
End it up with the bottle
Taking shots, waiting on tomorrow
Trying to fill up, what's hollow
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
Cause you don't care, no
Get lost in this city, try to find myself
I went up a different person
Came down somebody else
I know it ain´t right
But its all in my head
Wow I'm surprised
I'm still alive I should be dead
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
Bright lights, big city going to my head
I don't care no, no
You don't care, no
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name
You gonna know my name by the end of the night, well…

[Hook]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby
[Verse 1]
Bye baby, I guess you knew why I walked away
When we walked to the altar that was an awesome day
Did counseling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why did we mess it up? We was friends, we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave let it go he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with Mom, fucking other women
Fuck that gotta do with us
Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burning cash, now baby do it up
No matter who you fuck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shorty since before I saw you screaming
Hate you so much right now
Should've saw the meaning, angry black woman
Actions of a demon, I'm leaving
[Hook]
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby
You know I'm saying bye-bye
Cause I'm saying bye-bye
[Verse 2]
Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time different year, I was digging y'all flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could stop us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet, the cuter version
Yet I knew you personally, better than you knew yourself and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like "Ha, yo, look at my wife!"
Gangsta, me and twenty cops 'bout to fight
Crazy night,
 
bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby guess what
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition
Divorce lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending
With you paying out the ass and I’m talking half
Not some but half, no, serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart, you leaving behind
It’s either that or die,
 I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards, under their breath
Saying why did Nas trust her
But look at yourself, speak louder bro
You live with your babymoms and scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake pimps you ain’t even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your colour, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type and watch me do it all again
It’s a beautiful life, aight
Goodbye

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo Yo 
Peep the black Moses
Literature in pure dosage
From the landscape of 
Kuwait
 jakes and vultures
Too many of us lose focus
Due to the fact that, we all just a bunch of soldiers
Foul cultures
Funny how the streets mold us
Allah told us
 
in the cages where they hold us
Its much colder
Then babies follow our footsteps the way we rep
They model us leave a richer nigga dead and wet though
We learn the same jewels but it seems we forget though
Yeah
Shoulda knew what love is before we learn what a thug is
Know we left 
our seeds
 to be raised by they mothers
I seen the hood raise brothers
Kill too many of us
A thin line between the haters and the ones who love us
A thinner line from the freedom and the foul judges
In the streets where the snake niggas hold grudges
Chorus #1
(Nas)
Music make this thug calm down
Music make this thug.....calm down
Music make this thug calm down
Music make this thuuuug.....calm down
Yeah
[Nas]
Yo Yo
I know you hate to hear the drama but drama's all we know
We laugh with the rich cats when they leave we switch back
Somebody asked yo how he get that with his bitch ass
Comin' through on the humble just to chit chat
He used to be down on the corner with us
He was born with niggas but know he's on to mad figgas
With mad bitches a sharp dresser
Cool nigga but about to be called out
By the heart testers
 
never known for bustin his chrome
Wasn't soft but wasn't respected till he was grown
School he graduated somebody you could say had made it
While we stayed in the projects walking the pavement
Everybody has their ups and downs
But this one kid had stayed rich while we slang the grave shifts
"I'm tired of it!"
 
said a cat whose name I'mma leave anonymous
Cuz he might take it as some kind of dis
Anyway he saw him driving up inside the projects
Tried to stick him but he got bodied in the process
The victor had become the victim
Thought he had a smooth nigga caught but a smooth nigga licked him
Chorus #2
(Nas)
All the way doooooown
Music make these thuuuugs...calm down
Music make these thugs calm down
Music make these thuuuugs...calm down
[Noreaga]
Yo 
Jose Luis
 gotcha golden guns 
Frank Sinatra
Amigo sancha 
all on the scene with binocular
Fajardo Bayamon me and Ramon
Chrome K-Tone back to 
San Juan my pops home
Sit on the throne like a king of my 
ca'
Take mine genuine laced up laid up
Yo ?Que Pasa? ven aqui yo you and your hijo
Perico Puerto Rico Manny's hijo Chico
He kept his heat low by his feet though
Came with mami chula grande cula
Little menuda smoke buddah fatty bangin' plus the bitch cuta
Que linda you should seened her
Iraq
 rush ya premises the nemesis
Drinkin 
Guinesses
 What! for 
Revelation on the Genesis
The Nazis and worn papi call up Khadafi
I'm on today 
we stayin' bent all day
And put the lye out in your mug like ashtray
Cabron
! Castellano too many people in my cypher bloody up my visiano
Too much weakness 
the German
 secret laid my pregame down
You just a hijo slap you with the black heat though
I'm all about my clique blowin' up people showin' up
CNN

Buddah bless me caress me

Undress me suck me off
 
Crunch much like a Nestle
Suck it off suck it off suck it off suck me off
Chorus #1 and #2

[Intro:]
Yea, hehe. Don Quan
A vision of God's Son Nas. That nigga Cass rules. Whattup baby
[Hook: Quan]
Y'all niggas is crazy. *To think* Y'all niggas can't fade me
*Trick these* From the bottom to the top, from the booth to the block
Anyway I got to get it, I'm givin it all I got
Y'all haters can't hold me. *No Way* And y'all don't want to zone me
*Want it your way* So when I get, I'm gon' get it, in my life how I live it
And whips I be whippin, 
smokin on that exquisite
[Nas]
In the crib, two bricks of coke, liquor and dope
Pretty Hawaian bitches who eat choch and deep throat
Same niggas that get down, remember them
California style, yeah I went back again
But much wiser, cause these guys are
Leave you up shits creek and won't lose sleep
So while we pack the heat, I got the heckler and koch
My man got the dot, five-oh block
It's like the 
movies shots
 as niggas watch
But the American version
East coast, west coast as we connect these curtains
Cause we ain't scared to buck, step on the Timbs and Chuck's
Is gonna happen, gun clappin, remember that
Now we on the southern part of the map
Houston, party of the year, everybody there
Texas, no guest list, only real players allowed
Me and my dudes make out rounds *Yall must be crazy*
[Hook: Quan]
[Quan]
VA game spittin, platinum grill grinnin
 spinnin, with 
 glistenin
Any amount we sippin, passion for thugs livin
Free, fresh and out of prison
Flexin that new edition
Good grain gettin, shit and lovin the feelin
Bobby Womack singin, Marisa Rings gleaming
Hat cocked duce, puffin the quarter loosely
Poppin the bottle and tippin fifth of that to goosey
Shinnin for Swill and Halle, smokin for Lil' Shawney
Still reppin 
Bad Newz
, and all my soldiers fallen
Enjoy some better days, dispute burdens I carry
See cousin hookin money, for God momentary
Floss every chance I get, 
 freely
Still spittin gangsta shit, cause the streets need me
Still got that MAC with me, for niggas actin silly
Still pimpin gangsta pretty, reppin in every city
[Hook: Quan]
[Cassidy]
Yeah, I pray every day for a 
I think it's gon' get better but it's like I'm never right
Make it better Christ, I'm on both of my knees
There's no hope, that why I'm smokin the trees
Damn, all for the chees, I lost both of my mans
That's why there's toasters in both of my hands
Damn, and I'll sell coke and birds 'fore I go to work
I go to the Range more than I go to church
My whole mentality twisted, but this reality isn't it
I ain't tryin to be fatality listed
And yo reverend, gettin dough is like goin to heaven
And goin to jail, like goin to hell
But before I go in the grave, I'll go in the cell
Just send my 
 in the mail
Oh well, but I got god on my side so I'm beatin the case
This life crazy but I'm keepin the faith

[Produced by Will.I.Am]
[Nas]
There comes a day in your life when you wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch when you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts, have a cold one
Brag, to your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'mma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8 by 10's
Of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that could've made your career stop
All that, and your man is still here and I'm still hot
Wow, I need a moment y'all
See I almost felt a tear drop
[Hook]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem
Nas
, 
the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme
Never on schedule, but always on time
[Hook]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me, truly this is what made me
Break me, not a thing's gonna break me (2x)
Ohh, I'm that history I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the number spot
That's my past that made me hot
Here's my life long anthem
Can't forget about you
(Can't forget about, Can't forget about you) (2x)
[Nas]
Can't forget about the old school, 
Bam, Caz, Melle Mel,
 
Flash
Rocksteady spinnin on they back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy, Fresh Prince
Fat Boys broke up
, 
rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it messed you up
When Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love
[Hook]
[Hook]
[Nas]
Unforgettable, unsubmittable, I go by N now
Just one syllable
, 
it's the end cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe, Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moon walk on Motown 25
[Hook]
[Hook]
[Nat "King" Cole sample]
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too

[Intro: Nas]
Yeah, niggas want to talk about this rap shit
Niggas want to talk about this money
About these cars, these homes, these labels
Clothes, sneakers, big money shit
Now everybody trying to get rich
Now get rich niggas, fuck it
[Verse 1: Nas]
Some rap pioneers, be them crackheads
When they speak, you see missin' teeth
Silver chain with a silver piece
Niggas your grandfather's age
They pants still hangin' down they legs talkin' about they ain't paid
And they hate you, cause they say, you ain't pay dues
And Slyvia Robinson was stealin' and robbin' them
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or because MC's skills are lost
It's because we can't see ourselves as the boss
Deep-rooted through slavery, self-hatred
The Jewish stick together, friends in high places
We on some low level shit
We don't want niggas to ever win
See, everybody got a label
Everybody's a rapper but few flow fatal
It's fucked up, it all started from two turntables
[Hook: Nas]
When they crown you - and you rise up to your position
+Carry On Tradition+
When they knight you - then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition
+Carry On Tradition+ - +Carry On Tradition+
Carry on, ca-carry on, +Carry On tradition+
+Carry On Tradition+, 
when you rep what we rep
Then
 +Carry On Tradition+
[Verse 2: Nas]
Now some of these new rappers got their caps flipped backwards
Wit their fingers intertwined in some gang-sign madness
I got an exam, let's see if y'all pass it
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest
Some of you new rappers, I don't understand your code
You have your man shoot you, like in that Sopranos episode
Do anythin' to get in the game, mixtapes, you spit hate
Against bosses; hungry fucks are moraless
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate vocalists
Niggas, I coulda wrote your shit; I had off-time, was bored wit this
I coulda made my double-LP, just by samplin' different parts of Nautilus
Still came five on the charts with zero audience
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit
Y'all got awards for your bricks
 - it got good 
to
 ya
You started tellin' them bigger dogs to call it quits
?! WHAT?
[Hook: Nas]
When they crown you - and you rise up to your position
+Carry On Tradition+
When they knight you - then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition
+Carry On Tradition+ - +Carry On Tradition+
Carry on, ca-carry on, +Carry On tradition+
+Carry On Tradition+, when you rep what we rep
Then +Carry On Tradition+
[Verse 3: Nas]
Now niggas got the studio poppin', it's mad clearer
Engineers got his earplugs and still hear us
The live-in-the-park sound, versus the studio state of art sound
We on the charts now; from British Walkers and Argyles
Look at us rap stars now, wit our black cars now
Fortune 500 listed
, 
brunches, sip Cipriani's
Sippin', blunted
, 
with rich white guys around me
Thick white girls around me
, 
Chinese lined up
Because I'm what?, every dime lust
We used to be a ghetto secret
; 
can't make my mind up
If I want that or the whole world to peep it
Now +Carry On tradition+
Fuck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin'
Peace to the strugglin' artists
 and dead one's gone, we miss 'em
I promise I +Carry On tradition+
[Hook: Nas]
When they crown you - and you rise up to your position
+Carry On Tradition+
When they knight you - then you go to fight, go to war, don't petition
+Carry On Tradition+ - +Carry On Tradition+
Carry on, ca-carry on, +Carry On tradition+
+Carry On Tradition+, when you rep what we rep
Then +Carry On Tradition+

Intro: Noreaga talking
[Noreaga]
Yo, New Orleans, LA, Va to Queens, I-95, where we never drive clean
But good, 
gotta get out the hood, to really make it, now we kick it
Until our whole team'll take it to another level, another Rolie wit
Another bezel, like war against God
 against another devil
Sustainin, now we rim Moschino, niggas say we taped it, switched it
Now it's Cristal, instead of Mistic, Jose, catch me wit a pigeon and
A gold biscuit
, gettin mad lifted, let me find out, it's sellin dimes
Out my crack house, yeah that's crashed out, let me catch that
Just like Stackhouse, kick ya back out, have you mad vexed
Like you did your whole bid, but didn't max out, yo Jose is
In other words courageous, from South Carolina to D.C
Yo the NC in Atlanta like Montana, comin out the airport wit the hammer
Motherfucker, smoke more weed than Chris Tucker, in Friday
When he treated Worm like a sucker, in three ways
Sell a whole key in three days, the way I know the crack game'll have you
Amazed
In the ill days, yo I drink Lectaid, Jose is sayin chulo, like Menegay
South side lost royal and royal, grand royale in Ohio, Cincinnati, Minnesoto
Yo from Philly to Connecticut, got niggas settin in, all predicate
Like this rap game is pregnant, N-O-R-E, Nore
Stand for Niggas On the Run Eatin, no matter if they still treatin
The object of the game is just to stay leavin, hit me on the Nokio
Let me know if you still breathin, top grenade, ice it up, cop pies, slice it
Up
You really think you nice enough, fuck around wit Trice Allah
Even seekin scrolls until your world fall in, to my niggas gettin they props
Where they supposed to've been, don't rush, take your time
The best come to those who wait, like Heinz, they be ketchup and spoil your
Keg
Aiyyo it's I-95, wit my niggas lost faith, wha!
Chorus 2x: Nas (Noreaga)
Blood money (That's what this life lead to)
Blood money (That's how my niggas bleed to)
Blood money (That's what we smoke weed to)
Blood money (That's how my niggas eat to)
[Nature]
Aiyyo, eatin from the same plate, and drinkin from the same cup
Whoever thought that some much would have to change
I went to games as a Knicks fan, they had Strickland, they traded him
Ever since then, son, I hated them, shit's turnin sour in the N-Y
Half the team hurt, still niggas get high and rock Queens shirts
Feinds on the block know me for holdin b's work
Seein chips poppin up in European whips, exceed the speed limit
Tinted up and weed scented, treatin life like the auto bomb, never slow up
I'm gettin head for being young and vulger, fly gifted
Y'all niggas die over bitch shit, I got some hoes in the law 
gettin high
Like Rik Smits
, born hypocrit, every now and then be on some different shit
Switch directions, my bad, quick disception
My first love is for bloody money so skip the extras
Chorus
[Nas]
Now what's a don?, a nigga that's a thug wit a charm, always on point
As soon as he's on, his goons'll respond, he move right and fear losin his
Life
Mad dime, but never could fit the shoes of his wife
You could tell by the finger nails, clean, hair diced up, every four days
A weekly routine
, 
where he lived, stay out the hood, fuck what a nigga say
Out for blood, but yo
, 
lustin the dough, he see snake smile for way
In the same garden he play
, but a true don'll get his proper groove on
He tell the truth even when he lies, give you a fake name
Even though his name is Nas, god body, and wide body, rumble for five
To the S-Class,
 six niggas, double your size, 
either come wit a plan
To make it happen, cuz sellin weight or rappin, we still trapped in a slave
Mind
And keep the crackers laughin
(That's what this life lead to)
Chorus

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
This a celebration, this is levitation
Look at how you winning now?
This took dedication
; 
this is meditation
Higher education; this the official competitor elimination
I-I-I-I was taking trips with Web to move weight
Came back to Queens to hit up a new state
Bitches don't know the half, like they flunk they math
Bitches ain't half cut up crack up in the stash
50 Cent Italian, icy flow
This is that Run-and-Get-a-Dollar-for-The-Ice-Cream-Cone
Cause they killed my little cousin Nicholas
But my memories only happy images
This is for the hood, this is for the kids
This is for the single mothers; niggas doing bids
This one is for Tee-Tee, Tweety, Voila, Sharika
Candace, Thembi, Lauren, Aisha
[Hook: Nicki Minaj]
It's a celebration (Put one in the air for the ghetto, ooh)
It's times like these (Ooh, ooh)
They know who we are by now (They know who we are)
Champion, the champions (Champion, champion)
[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah, okay
We made it to America
I remember when I used to stay with Erica
Label transferred 20 million to Comerica
It's fucking terrible, it's got me acting out of character
Young T.O. nigga
, 
either riding range
Or Ferrari top down, screaming, "Money ain't a thang!"
Tell me when I change, girl, but only when I change
Cause I live this shit for real, niggas know me in the game, 
they know!
Making hits in three acre cribs
Cooking up tryna eat niggas, steak and ribs
I made a couple stars outta basic chicks
Nowadays blow the candles out, don't even make a wish
Having good times, making good money
Lot of bad bitches, but they good to me
I make them do the splits for a rap
Wish you niggas good luck, trynna get where I'm at
Straight like that
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Young Jeezy]
Straight balling in this bitch, Jeremy Lin; 'Melo
Tell me one thing you won't do: settle
Give me one word for your chain: yellow
Pocket full of money, black cars; ghetto
Critics say I ain't in the game, A.I
Jeezy, how you deal with the fame? Stay high
Stay putting on for the town, may I?
What you call a crib in the sky? Play-high
Over a mil in three weeks, yeah I did it like a champ
Momma taught me pride, yeah she did it with the stamps
Wait a minute, everybody pause for the photo
Somebody tell these local hating niggas, I'm global
Tell me what I gotta do to get this champagne going
What I gotta do to get this coconut flowing?
Don't let me hear Shawn Carter, I'm the ballest of the ace
Let me hit up Sean Combs, money cases in my place, let's celebrate
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Nas]
What up, Nicki?
It's Nasty, yeah
I saw my first two million dollars, I was 23
I'm barely a man, yet, I had some killers under me
This ain't rated PG, this rated PJ
Cause that's where a nigga from; murder on replay
My 24th b-day, I'm sailing to Bermy, you can see me on a yacht
Blasting Pac,
 little knot, I ain't greedy
I'm back to thugging, bitches
Back to making them kiss other bitches
My man sister like me, I don't fuck my brother sister
I just aspire your desire to be different
My ten year old plan is just one year to finish
My list looks like this, first thing that you'll discover
The difference in pussy: white, black, Latin and other
Here's a man who clearly isn't basic
Waiting list, just to hear me or witness the greatness
Loud laughter, while writing my next chapter: Fast Cash Life
Happily ever after
Champions

[Hook: Amy Winehouse]
Where is he, the man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can’t see
Where is he, the man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can’t see
And I’m alone and I realize that when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
Yes, I’m alone and I realize when I get home
I wanna talk to my red and my cherry
[Verse 1]
I want someone who like the champagne I like
My a-alike,
 
someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine,
 
she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't looking good
For real, the world so ill; yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the President
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven sent
Your smile put me at ease,
 
you’re the woman I need but where is she
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I hate when people write me hostile texts on account
Of my lifestyle’s perception,
 
invade my personal life out of the question
What are they expecting
I be trying to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I’m rolling in dough
Swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool or ass
I’m well known, got people coming at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator
, 
vagabond
I’d gallivant around the equator
If that would get me off the radar
It’s so intense, I’m on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris with some lime what is this
An immaculate version of Me and My Bitch by Biggie
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Yeah, yeah, let’s pour some cherry wine
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, Hey yo Salaam, yea, I think they know the time
Everything’s good, everything’s fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah
Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what
Life is good, life is good
Life is good, yeah
No matter what
Life is good

And now for my next number I'd like to return to the
[Nas]
Classic
[Kanye West]
Uh, uh, - timeless
[Kool G Rap]
Live straight classic
[Nas]
Classic
[Kool G Rap]
Live, straight classic
[Kanye West]
Timeless
[Sample]
I'd like to return to the classic
[Rakim]
Kanye West
[Rakim Sample]
I'm Rakim, the fiend of a microphone
[Verse 1: Rakim]
Uh yea, is y'all ready for 20-07
It's now another drought
Everybody's a killer, why are we bugging out
Since '86 showin' the crowd what I'm about
And they still wanna know when the album coming out
Ask the teenagers, OG's and nasty kids
What their definition of classic is
Timeless, so age don't count in the booth
When your flow stay submerged in the fountain of youth
Ain't no doubting the truth, I'm off the meters
Everybody cosigning, even non-believers
Since I came in the door
 
became one of y'alls leaders
In a fresh pair Air Force One sneakers
Uptowns, we call em uppies, when they're on divas
Probably worn when KRS-One teaches
Nas made you look before the heaters
I bet you Kan' had em on when he walked with Jesus
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Kanye West]
You can't buy this Superfly-ness
Like a shine is, 
your highness
Is performing, look how long the line is
It's what happens when you make shit that's timeless
It's what happens, these rappers is the pioneers
What do it take to be a legend like Nas is
That's so novice, I'm so polished
I got a right to be a lil bit snobbish
I did a lil bit of college
Semesters, it took two like Rob Base
To let me figure out this wasn't my place
The beat's slow, til you listen to my pace
Cause I be killing shit, but that's evident
And y'all feeling it, but I expected it
If it's classic, it's gon' last forever then
I'm everywhere you never been, and better than I ever been
[Hook]
[Nas Samples - One Love & It Ain't Hard To Tell]
Hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Nas'll rock well
[Verse 3: Nas]
Perseverance, see the fake hustler rapper
To them, it hurts to hear this
Oh you went platinum, yeah that's nice
Now let me see you do the same thing twice
Three times, four times, then a couple of mo' times
Please, you're Amateur Night, it's Showtime
It's one life to live, so live it the best you can
The world could use one less man
Not enough air, not enough car factories
To manufacture new vehicles, sedans and vans
When they do make the whip you like, your chips ain't right
By the time you could afford it, the car ain't importan
t
In the streets I'm in, it's just iron
Cops keep firing, in my environment
Leaving you slumped, then they drive home
Far from the hood, brothers they eager to jump on
I like to be the wall that they toast up on
I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
I'm classic like the Air One's, the hustler shoe
That's what I'm accustomed to, yeah
[Hook: Samples]
[KRS-One Sample]
"Of course - we have Blastmaster KRS-One"
[Verse 4: KRS-One]
How many of y'all got Criminal Minded
You, you, you, y'all don't be blinded
Me, I got no jewels on my neck
Why, I don't need em, I got your respect
KRS-One, twenty years I rock
I do it for JMJ and Scott La Rock
This hip-hop and we's a nation
Don't you wanna hear more KRS-One on your radio station
Instead of broadcasting how we smoke them trees
On the radio we need to hear more local emcees
Where you at?, c'mon where you at
This is the difference between emceeing and rap
Rappers spit rhymes that are mostly illegal
Emcees spit rhymes to uplift their people
Peace, Love, Unity, havin' fun
These are the lyrics of KRS-One
[Hook]

He's a kaleidoscope to look in
; a black men and white women
Sometimes together make exotic looking children
But mixed race kids become fixated on separating themselves from the hatred
Your grandma on the black side make you slam the station
Your grandma on the white side was educated in schools that were segregated; maybe she was racist
Maybe you can't, today, school her on some brand new today shit
If I grew up a rich boy, like this boy, this white boy, like you boy, the Christmas toys, the privileged joys
I think I'd be less stressed, the whole family at home, the ideal address
But he's dealing with self mutilation, dungeons and dragons, 
Ouija boards
, rituals with satan
Yeah, we grew up with similar anger

[Produced by DJ Premier]
And as a special treat this evening
I have asked America's foremost young poet
To read his latest poem for us
{*scratching by DJ Premier: "ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"We-we-we came a long way"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"*
[Verse 1:]
Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime,
 the thugs 
slingin powder and dimes
Twenties of D,
 
is yo' niggas wilder than mine?
My niggas bust nines,
 
puff lye
 and 
stick up cowards
For they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Luca Brasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's "Godfather" shit
, 
back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques, awards, applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
With stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns dont' bust your way
Niggas with names, livin off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothing changing
{*scratching by DJ Premier: "ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"}
[Hook x2]
If you ill come get me, cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war and I'm well prepared
If you ill come get me, cause I ain't running
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunning
Come get me if you real, cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love we can take it there
[Verse: 2]
You don't like me clown? Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what? You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shinin - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggas know what my nine pearl handle's about
Fuck you say girlie mouth?
 
Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me? I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggas to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers
(what nigga) and they all look clean
Who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next stop is to the graveyard
[Hook]
[Verse: 3]
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to 
go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nothing
Talk a bunch of shit motherfucker and stop fronting
You don't wanna
 flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of em dyin
I think like you do,
 
roll with about two irons
Catch me flying, high in the aircraft wining
- and dining, the rich ass
, 
then we laugh at your bitch-ass
When they gauze up your stab wounds
While I'm gettin head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons
, 
all my
 
ice
, 
and suitcases
Full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The
 
Illmatic
 
that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block
[Hook]
{*scratching by DJ Premier: "ladies and gentlemen.."

[Hook: Nas] **2X**
'Come Take a Ride' you can fit up in my two-seater
Nas a thug you can catch me in my wife beater
Blowin' my drugs you know how I like the cheeba-cheeba
And if you hatin' and I prolly don't like it either
[Nas]
Fresh dressed like a million bucks
Threw on my black jeans and Timberland Chucks
I got some moneys in my pockets got some money to spend
Got some hoochies I'mma hook up wit quarter to ten
My daughter wit me and we came from the mall
Don't need no baby mama drama
Kissed her on the cheek and dropped her back off
I hit the car wash at half past four
Some kid was star struck
I pulled off my grass and let 'em puff sour
My deuce-deuce rims shinin' happy as they can be
I went to the famous Project that they call QB
I saw some brothers gamblin' on the curb
A shorty pulled a pistol took they paper, nigga that's my word
I turned the corner wit my burner and palm
Niggas know my name and game I'm a murderous Don
Saw my peoples then extended my arm
Pulled on the sidewalk, no time to talk
If y'all comin' come on; come on!
[Hook: Nas] **2X**
[Nas]
Talk like a champion, walk like a champion
Body like a God and I promise that Nas'll a hit you off
Flow like a gangsta, brum bum bum bum bum
Bustin' black dummies and dustin' all y'all niggas off
I've been around a couple of times, know how things go
I dealt wit 'em all on different occasion
The same things'll come in different stages
So when them things rise up or pop up
I look right past as if its weightless
Meanin' it won't intervene the thought process
So I can levitate to more important topics
Laughin' the Face of Death, flash back of car crashes
20 L's Grey Goose vodka and tall glasses
Dippin' in the twilight
Wit gangsta smokin' weed in my ride light
The same stuff is still a bitch livin' like I'm rich
Bang broads call me Mr. International, ghetto stars come on
[Hook: Nas] **2X**
[Nas]
Slow like I robbed Brinks truck, 
haters all fold
Cuz my 9 is aimed up
, 
I left four seasons
My niggas bleedin' cause of four reasons
Jealousy, hate, laziness and envy even
Up in the Benzie squeezin' a couple Henny wit my comrad
Conversatin' on what we believe in
Like honey in the way she's been cause he's spend
G's a week in the make freak knees bend
I told her to pimp hard, see the hoes we left in the room
They nymphomaniacs prolly lick homegirls womb
As respect just phone 'em and leave 'em & shit
They not your wife keep your cash nigga don't even trip
Pass the grass accordingly, you saw police
But when I puffed and coughed
Seconds later screamin' "Fuck the Law"
Got CD's, TV's, guns tucked in the floor
Once again I hit the streets and y'all don't see no more
So uh...
[Hook: Nas] **5X**

Nas: "This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are
Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our
Heroes."
[Hook: Nas]
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV
, 
what ever happened to Wheezy
? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well"
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, "These are our heroes"
[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's 
call
 him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
You Homey The Clown
, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, dude? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes
[Hook]
[Nas:] "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know
The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods. Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr. Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs
What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit
And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit."
[Male Heckler:] "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though
Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in
My hood. What type of shit is that?"
[Overlapping dialogue]
[Nas:] "I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I
Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha
Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE."
[Thug Heckler:] "Come on man, give back to the hood. Cocky
Motherfucker!"

Chain glow
I'm the same though
[Hook]
Hold it up like a light, bright enough for the blind
Swear I’m willing to die, if you knowing anything, yo
Don’t be tripping cause your chain broke
And my motherfucking chain glow
We just tryna to see how change go
I had it
[Verse 1: James Fauntleroy]
Onlything
 
I change is my motherfucking number
Yeah like every other day like cause I’m running from the ones who say
You’ll never gonna make it
, as soon as I escape it
A nigga started making, Money like a motherfucker
Wishing administration, a straight face and I
Better think of tripping nigga, vacation I
Spend a lot of time working harder than a slave
For this motherfucking change, it’s a light the way for ya
So I was blazing up, 
as I fin to say to ya
If they right then tell me why they standing in the dark
In the same spot, see me from the fog cause my fucking chain glow
I’m the same though
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Ain’t no woman I hold that tell me that I smell like a billion
This black Moor
, 
Thug Sicilian
Ladies and divas, fly goon
That’s my story, 
when the moon hits your eye like a big piece of pie
That’s amore
The black Godfather
, probably relax in the forty, with all the odds
That we stop getting cast up on me
In the Ferrari, flagging down these two shorties
They in the benz, like Thelma and Louise
Is surely, we pulling over next exit
Only thing open is the Shoney's or best western
You looking for drinks and Shawty notice the necklace
She digging the links, she said it’s solid
Got diamonds all in the eyes like it winks ... touch it
[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
Shame on you, I’m on the other side of town
You let a nigga put a chain on you
And now you tripping cause you see a nigga got that new chain right here
That nigga chain don't do nothing else but put a fucking strain on you
But it’s cool you can break the chains
We're not living to stay the same
But if you stay with this lame nigga
Really, you can’t complain
Just let my motherfucking chain glow
[Hook]

[Hook 1 - JR GONG]
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force
I'm suggesting
You count your blessings
I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings
[VERSE 1 - NAS]
Cause yo', this year, 
can't wait 'till he gets here
7/21/09
 
my first son will shine
And it's amazing
, 
I'm about to be raising
Another made man, and like his dad they'll praise him
And some will hate him just cause we're building a nation
Like Bob did with Damian, the world will embrace him
Girls will chase him, foresee they will not break him
And when I'm not around you look for God and thank him
[Hook 2 - JR GONG]
And I've got somewhere to dress for
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings
And there'll be no need for tissues
Cause there'll be no further issues
If you've got someone who miss you
Man count your blessings
And I've got love and assurance
And I've got new heath insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings
[VERSE 2 - NAS]
You're wishing
You were sitting
In the top position
Picture perfect
Nothing less cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes
You never hurting
You knew that you was
Destined for greatness
For certain
But see the over zealous
They be thirsting
Caught up in emotion
You're keeping your composure
Like Gershwin
Songs by Earth, Wind
Keep you in a zone
Writing verses
So when your pocket's light
Know that you have a heavy purpose
[Hook 3 - JR GONG]
We've got pre-school and day care
We've got pension and well-fare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings
I've got joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings
I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through his door
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
So I count your blessings
[VERSE 3 - NAS]
I think you're looking too hard for it
Want the double R
Under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
And count your blessing
Count your blessings
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means
To reach the level I'm on
You should know that there's only one Nas
Y'all
But count your blessing
Count your blessing
Ra!
[Hook 4 - JR GONG]
And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new son is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
Not by force
I'm suggesting
You count your blessings
I've got love and assurance
I've got new heath insurance
I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings
And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here
Together after
Better count your blessings

[Intro]
Order in court, order in the court
No one else but Mr. Jones has the right to be speaking right now
Order in the court or I’m gonna start making some arresting here
You don’t belong in the court house anyway
, 
your rap concert has been canceled
Order in my court
, …
[Verse 1: Nas]
I wake up, wake up in the morning shake my third leg in the toilet
Uzi on my night stand
, 
I’m the man you go to war with
Not the man you go to war against
,
Patience I get you if that means I can’t sleep a whole year
I get you
, I'm official not a tisket, a tasket
I put you in the casket with a biscuit
The ratchet, the smoke a biscuit, the planted trees advanced weed
Doomed forsakers you fucking fake bloods like movie makeup
I flow tight as tootie bracers, who he hating us
I’ll be on the state bus, shackles is my eight bus
Cause y'all some tellers, opposite of bankers
I’m the shit for ages,
 my clip steel wheel … gangsters
Click still move like free masons, so we’re from on the flow from the law
Cause large is all across the nation, Nas is bread for the plan
The hold the grand dragon head in his hand
Come and get me, here I am
Pok’em, pok’em
[Hook]
I’m not a law prayer, so you could tell your mayor
I’m a non-stop driven by poetry slayer
One, two, three, down for the count
The result my lyrics oh yes, no doubt (X2)
Pok’em, pok’em
[Verse 2: Chuck D]
The good man in me gets money and stay on the path
But the Pimp shit in me says yo, keep looking for ass
My daughter gave me a gift,
 
something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snows
I told her never let a sucker nigger take off her clothes
Better wait till
You’re grown, when in love you will know
Everybody’s gotta dream I hope to wish to own a six times two
… against who I don’t know
So one who fed you won’t blow, you won’t eat, you won’t cake
Pay mistake, blaming me for their failures I'm fresh
Getting tale single breasted
A lip brush is sense less some pimp shit
A women hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he’s still with her
She take his cash give it to some other real nigga, like me
Pok’em, pok’em, pok’em
[Intro Repeated]

(Aiyyo calm down, fall back!
Y'all Queensbridge always fightin up in here!)
[Marley Marl]
Ladies and gentlemen, we got Queensbridge Finest up in this mothafucker
Tonight
They just came from war
They wanna let you know a little something about where they come from
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge" "The-the Bridge"
"The-the Bridge" "Queensbridge"
[MC Shan]
You love to hear the story, again and again
About a rap dynasty that just won't end
The monument, still in your face
Niggas played out, Shan still in the place
Hip hop was set out in the dark
The Bridge was never Over, we left our mark
The jam is dedicated to you and your boys
I brought my Queensbridge thugs to 
+Kill That Noise+
[Havoc]
If you was an out-of-towner, had to know somebody wit strength
You know the drill, shit was real, fuck around, got killed
You know the Hill breed of thugs, death to those that squeal
Squeezin them slugs, one love to thugs that died in the field
So many names don't got time to spit em, but through my rhymes they livin
We the Bridge through tracks I'm givin
Never lose sight, 41st Side's my life
The 40th Side of life, dunn we keepin it tight
[Cormega]
Yo it ain't just the music
Hoop aspirations or ghetto illusions
It's the product, east side, and all the beautiful children
And unleashed dreams comin through each building
If you sleep, you better wake up as you see
Mega more mature, I'm on a record wit Nature
Mind on my paper, nine in my waist
There's no denyin the greatness
Queensbridge, never try to disgrace it
[Millennium Thug]
Aiyyo the Queensbridge associations breeds similarity
Bricked up, chipped off rocked out salaries
Pull out long guns, pop out casualities
It's like I gotta see a thug nigga ill as me
The Ill Will in me, I rep that willingly
Step back enemies, death tracks feelin me
Six blocks, losin my mind
Runnin from D's
These P's got me usin my nine, I pop off
[Nature]
Y'all know the place where stars is from
Every night it sparks off and the crowds'll run
We leave chicks strippin over strollers (Slippin Sova)
In Queens, you be the victim till you get to know us
Your hood's bogus, my hood be keepin it crunk
So much be jumpin off I ain't sleep in a month
Y'all can play the front line, I be deep in the cut
Drive through, you can't peep it enough
You in the Bridge nigga
[Capone]
You must pay homage to my projects
We thorough to the end
Only jail and death divide us
From rap to the crack suppliers
Out-of-towners get knocked off
We regualte blocks laws
I had the hood like Watts flooded wit cop force
QB to the cracks in the pavement
Mister Everything that ? pool for stacks in a basement
Niggas understand the drama we bring
The legacy, dynasty upholding the ring where QB is king, what!
[Tragedy]
Yo for you I take a fifth to the head till I url
Boomerang dunn, QB bust they gun
Keep them PC niggas on the run, one
Mahti specialist, 2-5 the nemesis
The last verse, "T.O.N.Y." remember this
Resurrect through the birth of my seed, crime genetic
You synthetic, your gangsta's cosmetic
I move niggas telekinetic, who wanna set it
[Prodigy]
Yo yo move...
Me and my dogs comin through
We the grain, go against us you feel pain
Get rained on, we beat niggas numb
These niggas is dumb, you can't resist my dunns
2001 we still thump, the fuck happened to ya'll?
We like that snowball, goin downhill
We get large, you get bullets lodged
In your jaw, your ribs, your arms
We party hard, at the bar
Buyin bottles of overpriced styles and 
Remy Mar'n
The Head Niggas In Charge
We number one, QB there's no competition
Infamous Records, Bars and Hooks listen
Littles, Noyd, and Mega
We independent, dunn we Infamous Mobbin
G.O.D., Nitty and Twin in
The Ill Will Bravehearts, L.E.S. millennium
[Nas]
Yo blow faces, fo-fo blazes, no one's safe
This music mogul rollin wit a hundred soldiers
Gangstas we postal
Oh you didn't, wanna know whose life Was Written
The life I'm livin
The ice the women
The kites that sendin to lifeless biddin
The streets to prison
I touch you then buck you
Heats be spittin
La-ser, AR fifteen doors come down
Jaws is broke, your whole crew is coffin bound
Your ho, your man, lieutenant, your boss get found
This dough I got, I spend it and toss around
New York it's time we flip it, where you from?
Ladies, it's time we flip it, where you from?
Now tell me who was the true thugs in videos first?
Who had the projects behind us, who bit it the worst?
We from the largest project, yo the biggest on earth
Queensbridge know they history, left y'all cursed cuz
[Hook] *repeat to fade*
Keep on rockin the Bridge and keep rockin
If the beats stop rockin, the Bridge'll keep rockin

[Intro]
Check it out
I call it, yeah
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters
[Verse 1]
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up
First I regretted it then caught my rage like
How could I not protect her from this awful phase
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like
A princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thugging
So if her husband is a gangster can't be mad, I'll love him
Never for her I want better, homie in jail - dead that
Wait till he come home
You can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib
Plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rocking with it
[Hook]
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
[Verse 2]
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said Nas go and get your kid
She's on Twitter,
 
I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind,
 
she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagrammed it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she talking boy business, what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
And I ain't trying to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons, how fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off
Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love

To my niggas
To my niggas
What! What!
[Nas sings]
Looking back in time, when I had on my shine
I saw you standing there
I never tried to diss you, you didn't need your pistol
Why did you have to take it there
But then again, it was just my imagination
When my crew told me it was you that was player hating
Then we had to have that terrible confrontation
There's nothing I can do to help this situation...
Chorus: repeats 2x
[Nas sings]
Stay scheming (ya niggas kill me)
Niggas wanna get at me
Its been awhile since the last time we hung out
Full of weed, drinking henny until we all passed out
Stretch bently, Queens clique, pushing mean whips
And ho I'm with, glad who see she with
Shorty with the don
Me and horse switch cars
Jazz ruff for the six, this is it par
Thug nigga never thought I get this far
Who is that icing me from over there in the fog?
You got the mack god, you got the gat par
Dam, why they gotta do it to the black god
Everytime we chilling niggas want to act hard
My nigga Jungle known to slap a nigga back-ward
So we chill pay no mind, think about about shit
I'm for the love of it
Stubborn niggas always plotting on the brother tip
Can't even chill cause niggas just
[Nas sings]
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna get at me
Stay scheming
Niggas wanna kidnap me
But they never do it motherfuckers...

[Hook]
I know all of y'all hear me, none of y'all scare me
Cause niggas die daily
Coming out with my guns real early
Laying in your stairway, cause niggas die daily
So I got niggas around you
Mad like they're back for their man
You've killed just a year ago today
So call it a death anniversary
Rushing to emergency, niggas die daily
[Nas]
What if I told you that AZ didn't exist
And I put him there, played it like a ventriloquist
Cause niggas spit fake shit and y'all respect it
I spit that real shit and y'all won't buy the record
What if me and the rapper homey was really cool
And we used that whole thing as a media tool
Would you say I was a sucka or say I was savvy
If I told you mothafucka's that me and K wasn't married?
What if Jungle wrote my shit and I'm really illiterate
And the whole Nas catalog was just an experiment
What if I really died when Ill Will got shot
This is Will rhyming right now while Nas is chilling with 'Pac
What If I did all the advertisements thrown my way
And I've boned every chick that would throw me some play
I'd have to load another AK cause niggas be jealous
Cause we real like them Brazil favelas
[Hook]
[Nas]
Scream at the nigga "breathe don't breathe your last breath"
But you know a nigga dead when he pee on himself
Blatter giving up on 'em, face start to puff on 'em
Bloating up, nigga cold as fuck, trying hold on 'em
Loosen up the nine out of his fingers
Angels coming only he can hear the psalms that they're singing
And it hurts me, the planets cursed, B
This your niggas first year anniversary
This how it goes down in every ghetto
So it's quite natural for rappers to settle
And make pop music, nursery hooks
Cause back then we thought the only thing that worked was the jooks
They're tryna pimp a game that done pimped them first
I'm pimping the industry so they acknowledge our worth
The next anniversary we all unite
Let's all get together or we're loosing the fight
[Hook]

[Steve Stoute:]
That summer... the summer '88 is the best...
[Mariah:]
But that's your nostalgia though, "just for the nostalgia" you gotta say
[Steve Stoute:]
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip hop music ever
[Mariah:]
Right
[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, all that loving-making we did
Boy, it was so real, I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care say ''yeah, yeah, yeah''
Sing it like I used to do
This one is for me and you, oh
[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
La-di-da-di-da-di-da
That’s how you do it
Thats how to make it okay
And oh baby you know. make love
That’s how you do it
Just like you did it back then
This is dedicated to you
[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to you
I won't fool you, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, that love making we did
Boy, It was so real, I wanna feel that again
Loyal friends from way back then
Tell me can you vision us
36 Chambers high
Feels like we’re there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a fantasy, I hear ‘em singing back to me like...
[Chorus]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Nah, we don’t wish today’s game was old again
We just wish it wasn’t full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Who’s the greatest living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
‘87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about La Di Da Di got inside our bodies
Something about My Adidas coming out the speakers
Used to do doo-wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, Moneyearnin’ Mount Vernon
Let’s go
[Chorus]
[Outro: Mariah Carey] x6
Oh baby you know
Dedicated to you
Dedicated to you
Dedicated to you

[Verse 1: Nas]
Through the lights, cameras, and action, glamour, glitters, and gold
I unfold the scroll,
 
plant seeds to stampede the globe
When I'm deceased, by then the beast arise like yeast
To conquer peace leaving savages to roam in the streets
Live on the run,
 
police paying me to give in my gun
Trick my wisdom, with the system that imprisoned my son
Smoke a gold leaf,
 
I hold heat,
 
nonchalantly
I'm raunchy, but things I do is real it never haunts me
While, funny style niggas roll in the pile
Rooster heads profile on a bus to Rikers Isle
Holdin’ weed inside they pussy with they minds on the
Pretty things in life, gettin props is a true thug's wife
It's like a cycle,
 
niggas come home, some'll go in
Do a bullet, come back and do the same shit again
From the womb to the tomb, I presume the unpredictable
Guns salute life, rapidly, that's the ritual
[Hook] x4
Here's a toast to my foes, trees, & women
(Déjà Vu)
It's Like A Whole New Beginning...
[Verse 2: Nas]
Blunts, thugs and alcohol, what a mixture
Just picture, ya life as a whole judged in court they convict ya
They telling you your state of mind, like you worthless
So he curses,
 
his mom saying Bible verses
That's all she works with
But miracles never leave the churches
Instead, it hits the pockets of the Preacher just to purchase
A house, with a swimming pool
Labels me a sinning fool
I'm just a nigga who inherited a winning jewel
To be a trendsetter, whenever subject to respect
This and all respect through is the essential
To street life,
 
hustlin’ the struggle-broke ghettos
Boiling coke settles, slow inside a glass kettle
There's a Lee V on my T.V
Lifestyles of living easy
Got my crew tense, plottin’ to jips, to get whips
 
with BBS
Pushing cakes,
 
knew anorexics with ten plates
Celebrating elevation in the seeds that we make
So How You Like That?
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Escobar life,
 
gems and raw Tims
Gators for pretty boy haters
In Vegas with chicks trickin’ fortunes
I'm glistening, bells of cops whistling
Still I'm drifting in a high, blunts is like insulin
95-I,
 
I drive high zoning
Stash box zoning my trunk
, I flash not, teeth golden
Look at me now Ma
Blowin’ but for how far?
Cars, Cash, and Bitches got me out more
And things you never dreamed I can vouch for
Snake niggas, slither on the A-alikes
I ain't a Christian, but I find that we pray alike
Never the one to ask for the time to a saint
A mask and Nine, I think, will make my problems sink
Down a canal,
 
similar to how we drink
Distinct diamond-flooded Sphinx shines on my links
Drug money, snortin’ bitches, in the end of times
Got my nine, till I flatline,
 nigga give me mine
Déjà vu
 x4

Yo this Nas niggas whuttup?
QB Album coming, niggas I'll Will, Bravehearts
My nigga 
DJ Clue
 - put this shit on these niggas
Desert Storm baby 2000!
A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death
Energy could neva be destroyed
Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me
With bullets to my head
This is my you can't kill me niggas
I'm already dead, BRING IT!
I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You're on top - WHAT?
Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated
Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead
He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs
'
Stillmatic
', 
still eye 4 an eye
, wanna be God
You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas

[Intro: Nas]
You ever dance with the Devil under the pale moonlight?
Desperados travelling
What the fuck's up son?
We could do this word up, we could do this
[Chrous: Nas]
Spend too many nights on the Henny getting right
Breaking big face Bennies, betting against the friendly dice
I can't call it, it's going too good to spoil it
Tell it like it is, the raw shit never recorded
[
Canibus
]
At a thousand degree Celsius I make MCs melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Let me explain how I maintain thresholds to pain
I walk across the Sun barefoot looking for shade
I rearrange your ribcage like a twelve gauge at close range
And change the position of your brain
My hard raps penetrate through your hardhats and all that
Nigga, get ya wig peeled back
I scalp you like the Indians on horseback
Running Bull will hit you harder than running back
Stunning man with brave and cunning raps
Swiftly running laps around 48 tracks
Like uncut crack you fiends keep coming back
Heads is flipping like acrobats on gym mats
From wax to analogue tapes to digital DATs
It's critical black, that Canibus is ill like that
In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always tryna diss back
If niggas keep telling you that your shit's wack
I rip raps, hardcore raps wrestle you to the floor mat
Put you in the figure four, break your thorax
Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back
Till I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black
You get clapped bringing the wrong raps to combat
Like bringing a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats
Y'all niggas is wack, 
rapping over microphone feedback
My intelligence begins where yours peaks at
From Fox Boogie in the see-through brassiere to Nasty Nas here
My nigga Nature'll explain it further if it's not clear
[Nas and Foxy Brown]
Millionaire look at the sky make sure it's still there
Ice grill stares and my jewellery is in every year
Pierre Cardan back in a Dapper Dan time
Now flex, angle wrecks, Foxy rock Anne Klein
[Nas]
Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick
Sit back and feel the ultimate hit
Initiated to the Firm shit, real thugs learn quick
Sit back and feel the ultimate hit
[AZ]
Yo lock in, do the knowledge, follow the doctrine
We clocking, on your airwaves, keeping it rocking
Blaze up, make fire, light your 
Purple Haze
 up
Betcha tired, bitch ass niggas need to be caged up
So raise up fuck the playing, I'm sick of laying
I can picture spraying off an SK, shells ricocheting
Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut
Co-defendant caught a life sentence, seem him crack up
React what, who will, bail two mill'
Nigga cool still bet I'll be home before the news will
Blast fuse and leave purple Frank Matthews
Perhaps you confuse the concept black, cash rules
Incog another HAMO- D’s involved involved
Known freeze condo seize seven keys dissolved
Daily routine, speaking up for niggas who sling
Hand to hand on them street corners claiming you king
It's time to lock this, join with us, let your Glock spit
Guzzle the toxic, only fake niggas dry snitch
Get your guns out, it don't take much for me to dumb out
Play one route, lay ya shit down and run South
[Nature]
Here's the cause of this shit, more statistics
Deeper than the laws of physics, Malibu sand, the gorgeous bitches
Weed from 1-2-5, my whole crew live
A true Desperado, one that never choose sides
And show sympathy, just QB, an entity
Stock exchange, top of the game, watch you mention me
Image is nothing just obey your thirst
I blaze the Purple Haze, sit in a daze then display a verse
For those concerned or just eager to learn
I speak for The Firm, when zonin' keep the cheeba to burn
Stashing my riches, pass traditions like Olympics pass the torch 
flip shit so y'all could picture my thoughts
I'm drifting, it's type ill waking up looking like Phil
Twenty years younger same hunger same ice grill
Genetically form grade A pedigree
Born to carve rhymes, a swift tongue helped to set it free
Theoretically peep how we bless this, young and restless
Guns and westerns, learning to connect through lessons
From cool feats to camps, niggas shoot back
It's a proven fact, '97's mine, y'all niggas move back
[Hook]

[Intro Nas]
You ever dance with the devil under the pale moonlight?
Desperados, travellin
What the fuck's up son?
We could do this word up, we could do this
[Hook: The Firm]
Spend too many nights on the Henny gettin right
Breakin big face Bennies, bettin against the friendly dice
I can't call it, it's goin too good to spoil it
Tell it like it is, the raw shit never rewarded
Spend too many nights on the Henny gettin right
Breakin big face Bennies, bettin against the friendly dice
I can't call it, it's goin too good to spoil it
Tell it like it is, the raw shit never rewarded
[Verse 1 Nas]
We bust guns, my mans bring coke to customs
Rock garments like Muslims speaking with deep wisdoms
Fat ganja sack be the reason my lungs are black
It's tons of crack that made the pimp game fall off track
Horseback ride hoes, these black desperados
1 4 point O's, blaze hydros with my compadres
Rock waves, cop jade trainos
Getting facials and toes done, I rolls one
Notch up, hold Glocks up, in hot tubs
Get my cock sucked, pop slugs through bathroom doors
Scan my bitch, fucking with me
Hoes pull on cancer sticks, dressed in AX and Verso
?Murson Halo?, gimme head, gimme dough
Platinum triple times, nickel nine, simple crime
Equal hard times, ask ?? benting since 79
He sent me a vine, he told me get mine
No dig, so numb, coking up rum
Plottin', kill bitches with the dick then call Cochran
Passing Caz level, Daytona ice bezzle
You lay away, I take the day, flossing icecycles
Who am I to trust, Pablo, he copped the pie from us
Your wifeys private lust, asking me to tie her up
The fame and fortune got rappers put in early coffins
Niggas talking shit, broke, bragging and pushing Volkswagens
Sell ya tapes up at the Gabin, fake saggin'
You should've plotted with the cats who get paid
Retarded, 4 20's riding past
Diamonds that cut glass, Firm get the paper then we dash
[Verse 2 Foxy Brown]
Fuck that I done held it back, fuck y'all
You movin too quick, don't push ya luck y'all
The way I chiz, have these rap cats thinking you rich
Iced it up, frontin', then your girlfriends picked
If you thorough like you say you is, ho catch up
Ain´t no time for the slack up, my funds on the stack up
Glitterd up, rocks is kinda brolic now, give it up
BK a'day, go hey, shorty live it up
Laced up in anything, placed up cocksucker
It be the tuckers and the suckers that 'll try to fuck ya
See me, I'm pretty slimmy on the 3D
Copped the Burgundy E, my nigga copped the 450
LS, now what the fuck you gon tell us
That have your lame man talking shit from the plain land
Watch this, I get my pussy licked on the tropics
Bare chested, finnesed it, VVS'ed it
Spit mines, legally on the get mines
Straight jack move, while ya crew wanna dickride
Hate on me, bitch you slopped it and I rocks this
?? from your idol, ain't no stopping this
Got a little H, bag anything in the mirages
Got these cats licking toes and giving massages
Bonita, Platinum Visa where the cars is
We all know the stars and the shorty who's the ?laggis?
Caked up though, I'm g'd up, copping jade trainos
Word life, put that on my dick and my chips
Dippin' in the Yukon with all the jewels on
The unspeakable truth song, bent, gotta move on
[Verse 3 Canibus]
At a thousand degree Celsius I make MC's melt
Fuck my record label I appear courtesy of myself
Let me explain how I maintain thresholds to pain
I walk across the Sun barefoot lookin for shade
I rearrange your rib cage like a twelve gauge at close range
And change the position of your brain
My hard raps penetrate through your hardhats and all that
Nigga, get ya wig peeled back
I scalp you like the indians on horseback
Running Bull will hit you harder than runningback
Stunning man with brave and cunning rap
Swiftly running laps around 48 tracks
Like uncut crack you fiends keep coming back
Heads is flippin like acrobats on gym mats
From wax to analog tapes to digital DAT's
It's critical black, that Canibus is ill like that
In fact perhaps you should quit rap, instead of always
Tryin to diss back, cause niggas keep tellin you that your shit's wack
I rip raps, hardcore raps rushin you to the floor mat
Put you in the figure four, break your thorax
Jump off the top turnbuckle and land on your back
Til I hear it snap or crackle, the ref says chill black
You get clapped bringin the wrong raps to combat
Like bringin a paint gun to a shoot out with real gats
Y'all niggas is wack, rappin over microphone feedback
My intelligence begins where yours peaks at
From Fox Boogie in the see-through brasierre, to Nasty Nas here
My nigga Nature'll explain it further if it's not clear
[Verse 4 Nature]
Here's the cause of this shit, more statistics
Deeper than the laws of physics, Malibu sand ,the gorgeous bitches
Weed from 1-2-5, my whole crew live
A true Desperado, one that never choose sides
And show sympathy, just QB, an entity
Stock exchange, top of the game, watch you mention me
Image is nothin just obey your thirst
I blaze the Purple Haze, sit in a daze, then display your birth
For those concerned or just eager to learn
I speak for The Firm, was told to keep the cheeba to burn
Stashin my riches, past traditions, like Olympics
Pass the torch flip shit so y'all could picture my thoughts, I'm driftin
It's type ill wakin up lookin like filth
Twenty years younger same hunger same ice grill
Genetically form grade A pedigree
Born to carve rhymes, a swift tongue helped to set it free
Theoretically peep how we bless this, young and restless
Guns and westins, learnin to connect through lessons
From koofi's to caps, niggas shoot back
It's a proven fact, nine-seven's mine, y'all niggas move back
[Verse 5 AZ the Visualiza]
Yo lock in, through the knowledge, follow the doctrine
We clockin, on your airwaves, keepin it rockin
Blaze up, make fire, light your Purple Haze up
Betcha tired, bitch ass niggas need to be caged up
So raise up fuck the playin, I'm sick of layin
I can picture sprayin off an SK, shells ricochetin
Snatched up, in Supreme Court, eyes half shut
Co-defendant caught a life sentence, see him crack up
React what, who will, bail two mill'
Nigga cool still bet I'll be home before the news will
Blast fuse the rebirth of Frank Matthews
Perhaps you confuse the concept black, cash rules
Incog-ged, another had more deez involved
Known freeze condo seized seven keys dissolved
Daily routine, speakin up for niggas who sling
Hand to hand on them street corners claimin you king
It's time to lock this, join with us, let your Glock spit
Guzzle the toxic, only fake niggas drop snitch
Get your guns out, it don't take much for me to dumb out
Play one route, lay ya shit down and run South

[Intro]
This is a journey
Into the world's most largest and notorious projects, Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most cowardest rappers
[Verse 1]
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like tellin' some stories
First there's this arrogant fuck, his name's Cory
Hung around my man's Lakey and Big Trevor
Trevor's still locked up,
 
Lake's gettin' his cheddar
Corey changed his name to ahh, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat look-a-like, it's Mega
Right, Mega was his name, sorry about that
But it's so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
Always actin' tough, a jokester be frontin'
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothin'
But that's Nas always looking out for bredren
Cause when bredren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangsta's do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughin' to the bank and shit
Back to Cor', got him a deal but his rhymes was wack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch, you from around the way it's sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
[Refrain x2]
They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
[Verse 2]
Since we on the subject of traders and flunkies
Mega ain't the only faggot in my hood, dummies
There's plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arthur and Knight Sir Lancelot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what, nigga? Your button ain't gotten back to me
Askin' a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You ain't from my hood,
 
don't even rep Q.B
Nature moved to Marcy, man dick ridin' Nature, nothin' else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy, backwards ass niggas
Man fuck them niggas go head with the progam man proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we ain't friends
, 
you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity
[Refrain]
[Verse 3]
I put the name on the map after Marley and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent,
 
I laugh at the weak
So this about cleanin' up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P how many times ain't you shamed that
Jungle was bustin' his gun to get your weak chain back
They dont respect you a checks due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm saying your name
Hoes play your position cause you'll never be King
Even Jigga want the crown: "How that sound?" Poor thing!
I'm representin' Queensbridge U.S.A
Where two SK's go off every day ruthless-lay
All you little roaches and rats
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say
[Refrain]
[Nas talking]
"The Bridge is over," my dick!
The Bridge'll never be over, long as I'm alive and breathin'!
Braveheart to the graveyard!
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm sayin'?
Just get them unloyal niggas from out your circle!
You can't save everybody!
Niggas invited you to the hood - rep it right my nigga!
Be untouchable, my nigga, so it be Mobb for life for real, and that's real!
Ayo Nature, I can't hold your hand through this shit man!
I'm not your father, man!
Be your own man, stand on your own two!
I believe in you, believe in yourself, nigga, or dont even rep this, man!
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?
There's real gangsta shit going on in the streets man!
Yo niggas is in the grind! Where you be at man?
Niggas be buckin'! Why you never buckin'? Where you be at, man?
All of a sudden you the motherfuckin' Nino Brown of the fuckin' hood?
Its disgusting, man!
Stay out the magazines! Keep my name out your motherfuckin' mouth!
Theres no more room for jealousy, we destroyin' and rebuildin':
That means the cowards get out and real niggas stay!
Niggas been hating me since I been nine
Shining with suede motherfucking Bally's on and silks
I'mma always be the young don
Don't be like the niggas on the other side:
Hating me cause I'm beautiful! Real niggas in Queensbridge
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby!
Q.B

[R. Kelly]
No matter what ya'll say or do
We gotta get this money
Watch out playa, we come for you
Take all of your honies
First of the month and rent is due
We gotta get this paper
Come for us, we'll wait for you
A million men can't take us
1 - 
Did you ever think that you would be this rich
Did you ever think that you would have these hits
Did you ever think that you would be the don
Have a crib with a fifty acre lawn
Did you ever think that you would be this paid
Were there times when your ass was real afraid
Did you ever think that you would sell out tours
Have a show with fifty million viewers
I used to think about how I was gonna make it
Struggling day to day just trying to get this paper
Hoping the day would come when things would go my way
But now I'm living lavish and all I do is hear them say
Repeat 1
[Nas]
Hey yo
Now who knows poverty like Robert and me
Q, did you ever think you'd be dancin' and vibin' with me
Q, did you ever think you'd push a Ferrari, blast a Nas CD
With 5 TV's and DVD's, come on ride with me
Hey then you fly like me
Honey you heard about the style I got
We from the wildest plot, we're police
May the rest carry heat where best, we ghetto
Never thought we'd ever reach this level
My people behind metal
The streets coulda had us, but now we live lavish
Our preach be the baddest
Bus 'em out while maids change the sheets on the mattress
It's deep cuz I never thought I'd reach this status
Walk around and grown women stop and look
They recognize me, no longer hide they pocketbooks
Hate me now cuz I ain't gonna stop, you're stuck
The remix is R. Kelly, please drop the hook
Come on
Repeat 1
[R. Kelly]
America
Did you ever think
Ya ever know
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
(Come on)
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
Did ya ever think
Ya ever know
(Trackmasters)
Repeat 1
No matter what ya'll say or do
We gotta get this money
Watch out playa, we come for you
Take all of your honies
First of the month and rent is due
We gotta get this paper
Come for us, we'll wait for you
A million men can't take us
Repeat 1
Repeat 1
[Nas]
I just wanna thank God

Word to mama, any lineup of rhymers
Could bring any drama, anytime, the city's mine
Nas Is Like, Love Undying, Money's My Bitch
In Thugz Mansion
, 
thugs dancin' around the fly shit
Pharaoh garment's Prada, Egyptian camelback-riders
Pyramid architects
, 
Perignon bottles, money, jewelry want me then come
Get me, hit me but don't miss me, you history
Lead flowin' around like a Frisbee,
 
Italian dons from Sicily kiss me
This ain't 50, this ain't Jigga, this ain't Diddy, this ain't Pretty
Pain, power, pussy and pistols, lyrically no one, hold none near me, hear me
Kids cheer me like The Count of Monte-Cristo
Steady poundin' soundin' like G without the lisp though
My big bro told me plain and simple, "Nas do not look back"
Watch where you took rap
, 
no bookbags and trucker hats
Just army jacks and diamonds that's flashin'
What the fuck is that, freestyle
[Hook: Nas & L.E.S.]

Like Paul, Michael and Matthew, Peter, James and Andrew
Phillip, Simon and Judas
 -- 
I'm disciple of music
Street beats is the main thing minus the traitor
And I'm not a dictator, I'm the righteous invitin' you haters
Inside the life of the greatest, it'll take you through something real
Get a smack in your face, cause I hurt up, trauma-tize, llama
Bust shells, destroy yet try'ta prevent violence
If I present iron somebody dyin', don't even worry 'bout it
Then dress warm for the cemetery climate
When I speak I need cemetery silence, terror
See me, gold Hummers, Lamborghinis, man who stole the summer
Hand straight gleamin',
 
if I don't know you toe-tag you
Drag you through the cement, 
fo-fo maggie
Body parts in my man's Maserati car, then party hard in Madagascar
While rigor mortis'll grab ya, him retarded, I'm pass that
Gloves on, where the mask at? Too many love songs
All the thugs gone, what happened? Where's the passion?
Rappers battlin' non-rappers, carryin' on backwards
Laughin' sayin' Nas thinks he's Farrakhan preachin' blackness
Hell yeah, awareness is my alias
Word to the 'Braveheart' written on my bare chest
The realest, HERE IT IS!
[Hook: Nas & L.E.S.]

[Hook 1: Jr. Gong]

Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya
Despair, hey
Ayatollah
, 
Idi Amin
, 
Mennelek
Man a Masai Warrior
This spear

Fear and desperation
 no depression can't tarry ya
Despair
Like burning spear and such and such before me
Who all fought for the cause and
This Spear
, eh
Enforcing all the laws
[Verse 1: Nas]
The Master and the Masses
One has power
The other one lacks it
Guns are power
Controlled by assets
Owned by financial forecasters
Who are the Masters?
They are the Gangsters
They are the bankers
The ones who tax us
The Masses
They are us
The sheep, the people
Divided in classes
I go off like a Shi'ite bomb
And All ya'll see I'm on my
War paint on my face
, shit
My nine millimeter on my waist
I'm a problem
Shoot up your place shit
Let a few go
Then I get low
Blazing Haze
 again
The Masters, The Wall Street War Chiefs
The Elitists Groups
The Masses
They pray to Jesus
Saying he will see us through
The Masters are the aristocratic
The Masses
Ask if the Most High
Is On his way here
I'm trying to stay clear
My mind is my modern day Spear
[Hook 2: Jr. Gong]
Hey
I say...
This Spear, huh!
Shaka Zulu
, 
Bobo Shanti
, Man a Gideon
Man a Mau Mau Warrior
Despair, eh
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya
This Spear, hey
Through the hands of time and cruel men
It has slew more than a billion
Despair, eh
It keep on suppressing the humble man's opinion
[Nas - Verse 2]
This lead it'll Swiss cheese
When the fist squeeze
Mislead
The media misleads
Scares you to the point
Where you miss sleep
With that said
This lead with this Ruger
And that shooter
Sub-machine gun
Ratta tat through you
Copper tops, hollow points
Will do ya something bad
Our future
Is Mislead
Three strikes
There's no school
When a teacher strikes
This economy
This monopoly
Get no job
Just own your property
Now it's back to
What comes natural
Must survive any how you have to
Despair, Desperation
But I have no fear
When I hold This Spear
[Intermission]
[Jr. Gong - Bridge]
Make some boy know me nah smile
Cause this spear nah beg friends
Man a run racket
Man a run scheme
Man a run race
Man a run down Benz
Can't trust a she nor he nor we nor I
In a contact lense
Man a run from police
And a run down wealth
And dollars and nah make sense
[Jr. Gong: Verse 3]
So
Rise up to my defense
Hollow pointed is my preference
Should have been deterred
Don't know what you heard
Get referred
By the wrong reference
When this spear start dispense
It a fly and a tear through fence
Dismember your members
And all of your limbs
Body bust in enough segments
Well
Man a run drugs
Man a run risk
Man all a run out a time and ends
Man a run up and down
And a run fi dem life
And a run down this month rent
Nutin' nah go a yard
And food the a road
Then man have to go touch pavement
Despair was a tool
That was used to enslave man
And make manservant
Escape from Despair and Desperation
Becomes more urgent
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul
With spiritual detergent
A distant army
A distant relative
Controlling the circumference
And any man move with no permission
They're feeling the circumstance of
[Hook 3: Jr. Gong]
This Spear, hey
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a, eh
Man a Mau Mau Warrior
Despair, eh!
Fear of your recession and depression can't tarry ya
This Spear, hey
Inner city youth dem rise it up disguised as AK-47
This Spear, eh!
And anytime them clap it up the whole city level
This Spear
Like Burning Spear
And such and such before I
Who all fought for the cause and
This Spear, eh!
They can't ignore me
No!
[Outro: Dennis Brown]
What do you think of Africa?
Africa, Africa
Ha ha ha, Africa
Just, just the mention of it
Just the mention of it, man
It's like you call me name, man
Well you know Africa is motherland
And Africa is were we rightfully belong
And that's were I want to be

[Intro]
One more time, one more time
Uh, one more time, uh, one more time
[Verse 1]
I dream of the day I can go back, to when I was born
Laying in your arms, wishing you was here today mom
Wish you'd appear, just for a second from Heaven
My tears would be gone,
 
I wouldn't be rapping this song
I'd be happy driving up to your eight bedroom mansion
Up late, laughing about the hard times we faced
The galaxy is so enchanting beyond, Galileo's understanding
Past the milky way and all the planets
There's something out there greater but only God knows
Scientists claim we came from apes but they lies though
That was part of our conversation,
 
I spark one up, and start blazing
Thinking of how amazing she was, an angel gave me love
I'm thankful, to ever know a woman so real
I pray when I marry, my wife'll have one of your skills
But mom, you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up, just to see you one more day to have..
[Hook]
(One more dance with you mama)
If I could only have
(One more dance with you mama)
Praying, wishing that I could have
(One more dance with you mama)
If I could only have
(One more dance with you mama)
[Verse 2]
I wish you were here, I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace, forever I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice, and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7th '02, that's when the gates of heaven opened up
For you to stroll through,
 
beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on, and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through your sons and grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, mommy dance with him
And you've been my guide through, all the trouble I faced
They playing our song the life-beat, my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand, I'm trying not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed,
 
dreaming I can have..
[Hook]
[Outro]
I love you forever mom
You will always live through me, always

[Hook]
Dog shit, I shit you not
You bring that larceny, danger or harm around me
Dog shit, listen to me good
We the grand goons, you just a lickle nickel dime hood
[Verse 1 - Prodigy]
I’m the epitome slimeball
, 
fuck up out my eyesight
Fuck is on your brain? Dog shit? I’m not the clown type
Die fore I let a nigga play me, like I’m baby shit
Dog shit, you deaf, dumb or blind, I’m the craziest
Most Infamous rapper outta Now Why
Jealous of my shine, the truth is in your eyes
You wanna be down, I might allow you to work for me
The key words: “work for me”
, 
I put your ass in surgery
Ever step outta line, forget who's boat you ride
Forget who train you ride
Forget who flag you fly
Read the name on it, Mobb Deep
P and Hav run this,
 
employees get fired with some gun fire if it call for it
A thousand niggas couldn’t stop me once I get to going
You can have a nation of millions, still wouldn’t hold me back
Still wouldn’t be lethal as Bumpy the Mack
Matter fact…
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Havoc]
Once we get it going steam rolling over them
Drunk off the drama, ain't no way that you can sober them
Fuck outta here, you outta here, soul lift
Slugs leave a nigga open like a coke sniff
You know our music got these niggas into dope fiends
No intervention could get them off of they OD
Grand royal, all my goons you see loyal
Dedicated in the cut, wait weeks for you
And when they finally discover you
They gon' need a dental record, you've been dead a month or two
Post mortem, shrivelled up, how dare us
We penalise traitors and only hail trust
Inhale piff
 
and guzzle white liquor
I dont know you, you don’t know me, you’s a lie, nigga
I can see the tears in your eye
You ain't see nothing till you seen a grown man cry
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Nas]
Yo, every gang, every hood’s in my veins
It’s my thing, it’s real, 
I’m in tune
I chill like the cold side of the moon
Silence you dudes like an empty room
Empty out with silencers
You get murdered like Albert was in a saloon
Anastasia that is
Haters can’t live, talking about they putting 8 in my wig
I got my dollars up, try your luck, you die, no trial for us
Court appointed lawyers as foul as fuck and I’m too fly
Cause when you’re locked in prison, 
your clock stop ticking
Now, you came home look the same age you went in
Mentality wise, get iller when boxed in
Fresh home, and right off top, you get it popping
Freedom is a virtue
, niggas hanging way past they parole curfew
Blowing on that purple
, know my street ties, beef wise
I let three fly over your head, 
Welcome home P
Let's get this bread,
 dog shit

Don't body ya self

Don't body ya self nigga

Touch my dough I'm lettin .40 cals blow nigga
Not cows with four legs
But cals with more lead
That add up more dead
It's on nigga

Niggas don't want beef they vegetarian
Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarian
I push ya grown ass back in your mothers womb
You need nine more months
Your crews nine more punks
You rhyme on stuff and claim I ain't sign y'all up
If I sign y'all I'm on dust
Ya we from the same hood but nigga what?!
When y'all was tryin to rap y'all was makin me proud
Man now you fucked up, down on your luck, runnin your mouth man
Why don't be a real man, say you need a lil help
And I might help your ass off the shelf
But noooo, you're bein disrespectful
Thinkin son so cool that he won't check you
Stand down, the king is home
Queens is on

I am De Niro after Am.Ex. commercials
 and "The Fockers"
With Martin Scorsese after 
Gangs Of New York

Back together with the master plan
The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man
I'm in the streets like old graffiti
I'm hearin wankstas talkin greasy
Whether broke or rich my friend
Nasir bring that career to an end
And I'm bored with you MCs B
Ya'll beneath me
And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouiji
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on
And I blind y'all cause they call me "The Lord of the Rings"
Pinky heavy man, big stones in the weddin ban'
Smell of brimstone back from Hell again
Next verse gets worse from God's son to Devil's sin
Ya'll need to take it slow
Don't body ya self
Motherfucker act like ya know (05')
Motherfucker better take it slow
Don't body ya self
They say Jada defeated him
Joe too street for him
What's next?
 
I guess it's for Nas to ether him
Ya'll awaiting an MC burial
This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio
What does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual
Extreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world
Man that is righteous, faithful and keeps law
Will surely live declares the sovereign Lord
And you are none of the above
So you a sucka for death
 
if I'm a sucka for love
And ya wanna know why I don't got an answer niggas
Cause I truely understand these niggas
Scared of me so they talk about family members
Like I can't point out your grandma to niggas
Damn you was my man like crew
, dog
Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog
The Q is the borough of true dons
Any disrespect nigga we choose arms
Will it be

Crowes

Niggas don't want beef they vegetarian
Scared of pussy you climbed out a caesarian
I push ya grown ass back in your mothers womb
You need nine more months
Your crews nine more punks
You rhyme on stuff and claim I ain't sign y'all up
If I sign y'all I'm on dust
Ya we from the same hood but nigga what?!
When y'all was tryin to rap y'all was makin me proud
Man now you fucked up, down on your luck, runnin your mouth man
Why don't be a real man, say you need a lil help
And I might help your ass off the shelf
But noooo, you're bein disrespectful
Thinkin son so cool that he won't check you
Stand down, the king is home
Queens is on, NASDAQ, Dow Jones
Don't body ya self
Crazy
Take it slow man
Slow down
Take it slow motherfucker
Don't body ya self
Let's listen
Let's just listen
Don't body ya self
Listen
Slow down though man
Slow down
Ya'll gotta take it slow
[Verse 2: Nas]
I am De Niro after Am.Ex. commercials and "The Fockers"
With Martin Scorsese after Gangs Of New York could rock this
Back together with the master plan
The rebirth of Langston Hughes, I'm that man
I'm in the streets like old graffiti
I'm hearin wankstas talkin greasy
Whether broke or rich my friend
Nasir bring that career to an end
And I'm bored with you MCs B
Ya'll beneath me
And my raps bring horror like a board of Ouiji
Of course I'm the king, get my shine on
And I blind y'all cause they call me "The Lord of the Rings"
Pinky heavy man, big stones in the weddin ban'
Smell of brimstone back from Hell again
Next verse gets worse from God's son to Devil's sin
Ya'll need to take it slow
Don't body ya self
Motherfucker act like ya know (05')
Motherfucker better take it slow
Don't body ya self
[Verse 3: Game]
Me and Nas like Ether [?] makin' killin statements
Shootout with fags in front of the radio station
You ain't Superman the S stand for snitch on your cape
And since I'm signded to the Doc you tryin' to test my pactience
Commit lyrical homicide fly through the windshield
Your soul can't escape because of the wind chill
[?] of your Timbalands
That come to be known as the fagget ass nigga
Who made Many Men and Mr. Potato Head
I'll take that title, drop it off at your son's recital
Then read a quote from the Bible I'm suicidal
This ain't a rap war this survival
The beat is a grenade, the flow automatic rifle
So send your soldiers home, I wrap 'em like Iraqis
Send ashes home in a package without dirt on my khakis
This nigga gonna beef with a rapper then go run to the captain
Take it slow for that bullshit you asked for happen
Ya'll need to take it slow
Don't body ya self
Motherfucker act like ya know (05')
Motherfucker better take it slow
Don't body ya self
[Verse 4: Nas]
They say Jada defeated him
Joe too street for him
What's next? I guess it's for Nas to ether him
Ya'll awaiting an MC burial
This is ethereal, FM stereo to XM radio
What does it mean, ethereal? Hmm.. either heavenly or spiritual
Extreme, delicately light in a way that seems too perfect for this world
Man that is righteous, faithful and keeps law
Will surely live declares the sovereign Lord
And you are none of the above
So you a sucka for death if I'm a sucka for love
And ya wanna know why I don't got an answer niggas
Cause I truely understand these niggas
Scared of me so they talk about family members
Like I can't point out your grandma to niggas
Damn you was my man like crew, dog
Don't make me change your body frame to blue fog
The Q is the borough of true dons
Any disrespect nigga we choose arms
Will it be Gilmore or Crowes?
Nigga act like ya know
Yeah
Ya betta take it slow
Motherfucker act like ya know
Mess around and body ya self
Don't body ya self

[Busta Rhymes]
Doctor
, yeah
I think we got some shit for 'em 
(FLIP-MODE!)
Yeah I'mma rub these sticks together
Check it, and start a bonfire
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
And if you don't see it y'all niggas can't fuck with 
our
Flipmode Movement
 
- bounce in your truck to us
Y'all get stupid - 
don't try to fuck with us
Because you will get carried away, yeah you'll get carried away
[Busta Rhymes]
Now I'm subtle, once I pick up my metal
Put my foot on the pedal, ridin through every ghetto
Analyze the shit I'm seein when I sip Amaretto
A lot of bitches on the strip, struttin in they stilettos
Then they wave and say hello, when my
 
Lambo' is yellow
Everything they got a jingle when they walk like ah-Jello
See the niggas on the corner and I never forget it
And I never regret it because I see how you get it
Now because of you niggas, I'm a hustler nigga
'Gnac guzzler nigga, rip your 
jugular nigga
In the night I become the type to love when it's dark
Cause when I pull up and park, is when I'm makin my mark
See the fact's that I'm tryin to strive and capitalize in
Start to max-a-mimize and b-build a ent-ter-prise
And wh-while I'm stockin this bread, keep ah-stockin the lead
And leave a permanent dot, on the top of your head
[Hook]
[Nas]
Ill Will,
 
Flip-mooode!
I'm the Enigma,
 
there is none harder, smarter
Martyr
, 
Godfather
, 
my entrance, your departure
Pardon Dre this beat is a monster
, 
catchy
Like sleepin under open windows that's drafty
Then wakin up my throat scratchy, that's how I spit it nasty
They short, a few inches North of a dwarf
My flow's Murcielago
, 
ghostin' them narcos
Toastin' the ways of the original Pablos
Still a pyramid architect,
 
mix liquors like a chemist
Killer lyricist, poetical tyrant
Sneaker store terrorist,
 
Mt. Everest I climbed it
Heat is drawn
, 
no creepin on me whenever I'm bent
My mind spray, my nine spray
And freak styles like 3000 Andre
To keep pilin, keep pushin them drops
Nas
, runnin with hot Busta Bust, we don't stop
[Hook]
[Busta Rhymes]
Now I'm hot, and we runnin the block
Watch me run in your spot, fiends comin in flocks
Add a little cut to the coke when I'm cookin the pot
DRUGS, BITCH! I got what you want come and get what I got
Now I almost forgot, I come to close up your shop
I love to fold up a knot, love totin the Glock
Helps me feel safer when niggas try to scheme on my plot
Try to steal paper from me you gotta deal with a lot
See I will leave you to rot, only defendin my stock
Niggas know they pussy and struggle to pretend that they not
Lose your life in the drop, while I harvest the crop
My hot shit; bust a cannon have you run in your socks
See we live on the edge, bang shit with a sledgehammer
Split up your head, kill a snitch for the feds
Let's go, for the streets I'm always spittin a gospel
Get Nas holdin a barrel size of elephant nostril
[Hook]

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
This is a national security alert (Remix. Remix. Remix.)
Ground Music. Flip mode. 
Aftermath
. Here we go. (Remix Remix. Remix.)
[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Real talk word to mother it be the gutter brother
Back with another banger to set off the summer
Better get up and come a-round cause the way our shit will be cloggin up the toilet
You probably should call the plumber
You niggas get dumb and dumber thinkin you can come around and test me
Like these other niggas well pick a number
I''m sayin you should never ever think that you better nigga
Get it together and body your shit since mommy named me Trevor
Stellar the way I give a hell of a performance and get a
Reaction I attract all the people to come together
Whether niggas realize it or not oppose a letter
Just let a fella think what it wouldn't make him rememeber that
When I'm in the buildin it's cool for you to rest in
Remember I'm too hot to touch kid
Curious, my fire burnin niggas serious
I gift wrapped the flame and give it to niggas, here it is
See through motherfucker, we'll never be equal
I'll banish and make 'em vanish and do it for (the people)
I be the baddest see when I see when I spit I become the maddest
And kill 'em until the blood (seek through)
Front if you want but you know who the top biller
Bounce while I'm killin the strut and walk with a bop killa
[Hook: Busta Rhymes]
So don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
Don't touch me nigga (You might burn yourself)
It's gettin hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
We got 'em hot in this bitch (So throw the water on 'em)
Here we go
[Verse 2: Reek Da Villian] (Busta Rhymes]
R-double E-K, D-A Villian
I'll pull a grip out of this waist and splatter ya face
When the cali' blow, you'll get a face shot like a cameo
Rob the man and leave his ass naked like he D'Angelo
Bet I'll let a pistol dismiss you if it's a issue
Of a tissue that money'll get you clapped quick (come on)
Turn a wimp past wittle to a gym class hero
When my AR13'll make 'em backflip (come on)
[Verse 3: Spliff Star]
I'm a BK felon I'll run you down with a weapon
My goonies get looney anytime that I tell 'em
Dead 'em, I walk around with stacks in my denim
With fast foreign cars with the gator skin in 'em
Now I got pretty women all around the world
If I been in your city probably pound your girl
Had her stretched out swimmin in the pool with her breast out
Send her back home set to fire the sex out
[Hook]
[Verse 4: The Game]
Motherfucker, it's FLIP-MODE, when I come up in the club
Throwin up a dub
, 
liftin up a snuff
Flipmode be stars, you know who the fuck we are
Used to be fishscales, now we fuck with caviar
Eatin on supreme shit, at the round table
On some cream shit, like I grew up in Queensbridge
I talk reckless, the whole world know
My style is 
C4 and I'm ABOUT TO BLOW
 {*explosion*}
So don't get close, we'll touch ya ribs
And come bust lil' brother with the stick-up kids
Like, "Shh Take off the watch"
"Shhhhh Take off the watch"
"Shhhhh Take off the watch"
They said Game in the club with a big ass Glock
Like boom, guess who stepped in the room
LAX comin' through, JFK real soon
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Jump on the track like Michael Jeffrey
Even the referee say I need an ESPY
Award
 just applaud I'm a boar with a broad
I go hard and my leather so soft
 and I cough
And the board of health say the boy need help
I am so hot the AM just melt
All aboard, all aboard 
black card no fraud
I'm an extension cord
 
I'm a lightning rod
I'm a lion roar, I'm a dinosaur
I'm a sinus minus the nose I'm a cold
I'm raw than a temperature rose to five and
Two o's that's 500 degrees for those who know
My fire's higher than a liars
, we don't burn rubber, we burn tires
We riders, residers, we live in 
The Carter
Wayne is a flame that could live in the water
Ok now let's get it straight, either you bait
Or the mate either way you on my plate gettin ate
After grace, if you taste like base, snares and tenors be my dinner
I'm hotter in the winter
, 
burn like sinners
, turn like spinners
I swear I'll put ya in the urn by your picture
Boy we ain't playin Weezy baby, he the man
Hotter than the Peter Pan to a wet bear hand
[Hook]
[Verse 6: Nas]
Man, listen I spot a square dude from a distance
Through the tinted Maybach curtain in partition
Nip Tuck niggas, I could never fuck with 'em
Or pass the blunt with 'em, let the guns hit 'em
Bring fire, frizzy hair for perspire
You ain't a rider, pa'tna I'm a crippler
Crutch giver, hospitalizer, hottest whip driver
Keep on my hip, the biggest life or death decider
I ain't a rapper or an activist I'm badder
I used to run from a cracker named Lieutenant Casper
No black leather jackets or black berrets
Like my old days, like I stepped from a Vogue page
And none of y'all cop what I cop
Forget your excuse if the music ain't hot
Where the Range? Where the drops? Y'all never got hoes
See you on the club, wrist never on froze
[Hook]
[Verse 7: Big Daddy Kane]
Busta Bus pick me up in the Coupe to come bubble through
This is routine kid it ain't nothin new
You bring trouble to me the untouchable
Make me have to bring in the troops like George W
I'll scorch you somethin awful when I fell through
Of course the raw to be when you could put a broad to
Better bring with you your fire extinguisher
Listen I love static and I'm ready to cling to ya
(OK!) Kid I made it from magazine pages to big stages
How I made this through all the different ages
Thinkin you do it like this is outrageous
Yeah I'm sick with it but it's not contageous
Your hottest thing to me, not a thing
Every night my crib is like the Bada Bing
So make sure that you youngin's got it right
Kane's who's the fuckin rock stars party like
 (You heard)
[Hook]

[Produced by Precision]
[Nas - Verse 1]
Pushing drop-tops,
 
Stacy Lattisaw tapes,
 
the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants, yeah
X-Clan hair, with dreads at the top of my fade
Homicidal Feds on the blocks where I played b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause or because
Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the devil
Cause yo, 
I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin niggas swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets
The car show, 560's
, 
chemical afros
Acuras pumping Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be asses bustin out of they clothes
Wearing lip gloss, 
big door knockers peeling they earlobes
So where them years go?
 
Where the Old Gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here though, so
[Hook]
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinking, or puffing they herb
And I'm, still enjoying life's ride
; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Rikers Island buses still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers still drinking, or puffing they herb
And I'm, still enjoying life's ride; right?
[Verse 2]
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
In army boots, yelling "Join the armed forces!"
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigga crawling in the corporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be serving the beast too long
The murderers wearing police uniforms
, 
Confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancing
 to the music I chose
And Peachtree, Atlanta crackheads was tooting they nose
In frozen corners of Chicago, 
loaded up Llamas,
 children
With
 fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates, headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be having us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties coming up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Niggas used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buying hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegrating
'Til awareness started penetrating
The styles come from prison
, 
they used potatoes making liquor
Just to prove we some creative niggas
Turning nothing into something is God work
And you get nothing without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggas in chains
From Green to Sing-Sing
, I'm wanting y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, He takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got "God's Son" on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected from Hennys and getting blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo, because of that
I'm still blazing, going out for the cause
Still rocking stocking caps, not for the waves
, obeying no laws
And it's like that
[Hook]

Hell yeah
Check it check it check, check check
Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call
If you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
For sure, fuckin with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin
Cause you saw what happened to 2Pac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin V.I.P
With fly shorty P.Y.T
Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got
Or who you hang with, frontin when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
Then you can fuck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin? You turn your back they laffin at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
The bitch gross a lil' somethin too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit
DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice
A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
When you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin
Hope you're listenin, turn up your transisterin
Hot 97, KISS-FM
Or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin with your girl while you thinkin bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex
I break it down, how to adress, the opposite sex
Problems or questions, I can answer them best
Signin off Dr. Knockboot at your request, peace
Rest havens
Fuck y'all bitches
Y'all niggas get y'all shit tight
Dr. Knockboot gotta come take y'all bitches from ya!
AIGHT?! We out!

Uhh, uhh, where am I going
Where am I?
Yo, it's ill
[Verse 1]
Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm
Tequila bottle in my left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go
Can´t do myself in
Wolves in the night yo
, 
hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty
 
who wit' me?
My Crys too well, twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin'
I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas
Drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast
Highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview
If they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me
[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself
, 
gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself
[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though
Bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight
My foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways
Put out the haze
 
blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in television
Hella
 women
Jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swig
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, rumors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all
Things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good
Find myself laughing
Turn the cell off
No way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib
Tryna see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...
[Hook]

East coast *killer*, West coast *killer* (repeat 8X)
Verse One: RBX
While childish MC's battle over coastal fronts
I come with no fronts and smash in 
monkey fronts
If you want to be evil like Knieval then jump
I guarantee your punk ass catch the speed lump
The tactics, extract, morbid thoughts from the mental
Custom designed, for instrumental
Yes indeedy, lyrical graffiti
And this one's a burner, baby
Truck, like Toyata driven
True and livin drivin with the gat
Uhh, pop the clutch, let the 
Cold Crush
 rush
Then I flush wack material
That's if I don't mash them all to mush
Hush, let me burst, dare I gush
Cock-diezel cuts
Lyrical arsenal equivalent to arsenic
East coast *killer*, West coast *killer* (repeat 4X)
Verse Two: KRS-One
Yo, why do they make me wanna ruin they career?
Before I bust your shit let's get one thing clear
Don't provoke Kris no joke this
I don't ride no rapper's nutsac yo I stay focused
Beefin without skills seekin will only weaken
The artist speakin over beats and, you be cheatin
Cacaphony of small talent rappers, claimin a coast
Over instrumentals, ain't got no real street credentials
Here come the philosopher hip-hopppin ya correctly
Ignorant ass MC's continue to tempt me
Lyrics be empty like Alcatraz cellblock
Too many MC's rappin causin lyrical gridlock
Lyrical syllables interlock in my voicebox
Yet I'm still unknown like the X on Sadat
Just your typical, non-topical
Flex the optical illusion weak metaphoric style you be usin
I check one-two's and who's in the house
Like shit your lyrics ooze out ya mouth
Whattyou think this is? 
KRS-One from the Bronx kid!
East coast *killer*, West coast *killer* (repeat 8X)
Welcome to the New World Order
You are now under martial law
All constituional rights have been suspended
Verse Three: B-Real
The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast trippin goin on through out the business
East Coast West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from I'mma Killa Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool I can roll through any block
From Central to Westland Avenue, without my Glock
But some niggas can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killin in the highrise
Office, analyzing the song
Look at them red niggas, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggas bringin the skill
Mad caps get peeled if you oppose the Hill
Yeah that's right fool, you know who, the mighty Group Therapy
The mighty mighty Aftermath brigade, letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!
East coast *killer*, West coast *killer (repeat 8X)
Verse Four: Nas
Now when I bomb like Sadaam,
 
the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on running your spot hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, 
I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, emerging at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatchin hoes up, my flow's up
When the fuckin world blows up throw your hands up
It's a holdup, frontin like you down for the real
To make a meal, but when plan fold, 
nigga you squeal
Like Henry Hill
, but what's the fuckin deal?
East coast *killer* West coast *killer* (repeat 16X)

You are now under martial law
All constitutional rights had been suspended
[Verse Three: B-Real]
The most scandalous, cut the bad apple, we can handle this
Coast tripping going on through out the business
East Coast/West Coast anybody killer!
I don't give a fuck where you from
, I'ma Killa, Hill-er
I got crews on both sides together
Deeper than the ocean and down for whatever
Fool, I can roll through any block
From Central to Westland Avenue, without my Glock
But some niggas can't survive on both sides
So they try and break off, eliminate ties
Fools got to get wise, better realize
True, enemy lies killing in the highrise
Office, analyzing the song
Look at them Rap niggas, don't even get along
Kill that noise, four niggas bringing the skill
Mad caps get peeled, if you opposed the Hill
[Interlude #4: RBX]
Yeah, that's right fool, you know who
The mighty Group Therapy, the mighty mighty Aftermath brigade
Letting all you sound boys know
You're not ready to rumble or test this
Kill that noise!
[Duet Hook: Dr. Dre & Scarface X2]
[Verse Forth: Nas]
Now when I bomb like Sadaam, the world feels The Wrath of Khan
Desert Storm in this modern day Babylon
I be the twelve disciples strap arms
All black on, running your spot, hit the safe and I'm gone
Like a thief wrong, I keep the long 38 warm
Silent and calm, and blackout when the beef is on
Focus on your rap holsters, notice
I'm evil like the Exorcist to the locusts
Ferocious thoughts, are merging at night
Like Jehovah towards the virgin in white
I'm wrapped in a turban for spite
Like a Israelite snatching whores up, my flow's up
When the fucking world blows up (*Explosion*)
Throw your hands up, it's a holdup
Fronting like you down for the real; to make a meal
But when plan fold, nigga, you squeal like Heavy Heel
[RBX:] Kill that Noise!!
[Nas:] But what's the fucking deal?
[Real] Anybody killer!!
[Duet Hook: Dr. Dre & Scarface X2]
[Interlude #5: Dr. Dre]
YEAH!! YEAH!! YEAH!!

[Andre 3000]
Repent yourselves, your God is here
Minds don't speak, lips don't think
Eyes don't heal what the hands do see
What don't make sense will make you think
Make you think, think, think
Why must I keep my eyes all on you
When in my mind all I really want is you

[Intro]
Fuck Jay Z!
(What's up niggas, ayo, I know you ain't talking 'bout me, dog,
 
you? what?)
Fuck Jay Z!
(You been on my dick nigga,
 
you love my style, nigga)
Fuck Jay Z!
[Hook]
(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you – the king – you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already
[Verse 1]
Brace yourself for the main event
Y'all impatiently waiting
It's like an AIDS test
What's the result, not positive
Who's the best, Pac, Nas and B.I.G
Ain't no best
 – 
East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blowed up, no guts left, chest/face gone
How could Nas be garbage
Semi-autos at your cartilage
Burner at the side of your dome
Come out of my throne
I got this locked since 9-1
I am the truest
Name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiian Sophie fame,
 
kept my name in his music
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I've been fucked over
Left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some well wishers, friendly acting, envy hiding snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take
When these streets keep calling, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef
Started cocking up my weapon, slowly loading up this ammo
To explode it on a
 
camel
 
and his soldiers
I can handle this for dolo
 
and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G,
 
dick-sucking lips
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live
[Interlude]
I... will... not... lose
God's son across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at
Ill Will rest in peace,
 
let's do it niggas
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child,
 
I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad
Watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissing women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile? They called you ugly?
Well life is harsh; hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was getting chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smiling in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearing Jaz chains, no Tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hanging with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy,
 
a Stan
I still whip your ass. You thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho,
 
tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas
Feel these hot rocks fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot, cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you getting girls now cause of your looks
Ne-gro please,
 
you no mustache having
With whiskers like a rat,
 
compared to Beans you whack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hanging with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-riding faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
[Outro]
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's getting gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gonna come out your fat lips
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss

[Nas]
Nasir bin Olu Dara
 bis do Allah
Fist
 
full of dollars in a dice game god
D & D glass cloth Kangols guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful
Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser
 
slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary
 obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up gut 'em like fish
 
swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Everybody's crazy
Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
[Nas]
Peace fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em
 
fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin'
 
no discussion or waiting
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital
 criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier
 
houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning
, 
hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far
 
your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you,
 
you want to squash it
, 
you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but
[Hook]
[Nas]
I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers
 
you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready
 
I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation
Got pussy niggas get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe
I got some niggas with acid get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now
[Hook]

[Nas]
Uh, word
You dont get this everyday word
With so much drama, in QBC it's kinda hard bein Escobaro
Eldorado red sippin Don out the bottle
My lifes like a Donald Goines novel
,
We wave glasses like bravo
 Drunk niggas with mad problems
Shot pockets niggas on the block rock this
Buy cocaine cook it and chop it, lookin to profit
In triple ways goin through this difficult stage called life
With each year my physicals praised
,
Niggas slip beyond the reach of help
Caught in the street, thinkin they can teach they self
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly feed our family these streets are insanity
Amber me, caught inside a thugs fantasy
Richest nigga in showbiz is what I plan to be
Heavy desire hold this 9' ready to fire, you know me show me the money like I'm Jerry McGuire, it's on..
[Nature]
Its time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way, predicted Platinum in less then a day
So for that we toast, this ones for us why you acting Hov, all I do is write rap, stack, relax and smoke
Watchin my dreams come true,
 stay humble in the eyes of others, politicing with the wisest brothers
Its Nature, one a the latest, peak how I play this, 
straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites
From now till the day that I'm stiff, foul flagrant, pay the rent, always stay swift
Stuck in my ways type chauvinistic, since a youth I had a thing for big hoops, flooded rings and older bitches
Holdin my riches in lump-somes for trust funds,
 fully recovered thugs lust to bust guns
While some'll get drunk beat wives and cuss sons, a slow process called life lets show progress..
[Dre]
When I said I hold my own I wasn't frontin never claimed to be the baddest for skills, I got a little something
Coming through never the same old, hit a slick verse sippin drinks under a tropic rainbow
Nothin could give me more pleasure to spark this I worked the hardest, ducked the farthest makin me illest producing artist
Done crimes I ran from one time, could catch me with my crew bustin rhymes in the Sunshine
State, no case to fear I been with millionaires, out to make a killin for real's my resolution this year
Few places I walked most imagine, new faces I met at beauty pageants, past cuties now wanna do me
But never forgot where I was from, I check for family and every nigga who was down from day one
If you ain't speakin money language I can't hang with peak, your conversation is weak, I need the heat to get us famous, so it's senseless speak

Uhh... yeah... uhh...
[Verse 1: Nas]
Blessings of life to the children, they say life is like five days
Words of a old man with silver hair, in his wheelchair
His eyes were bloody while describin what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on top now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
Cause animals sense weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job knew the divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, cop a new five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers, hollow-tip lead busters
There's no heaven or hell - dead is dead fuckers
And your soul is with God
, 
your mind keeps lurkin the earth
Watchin your own murder reoccur
[Hook: repeat 2X]
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga totin inner pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born, and every nigga gone
And for every breath I breathe and live to see another mornin
[Verse 2: Blitz]
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked, refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality, loaded with foul stories of lust
Greed and contempt, no street is exempt
Extended clip shots, hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin em hustlers pitch rocks
Oil paintin pictures of my pain, illustrate the city in vain
Fallin deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind, in these fatal times
Vest crimes, nickel-plated nines and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them babies cry, still I'm sayin why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin high to relieve the pain, breathin in the game
Exhalin guilt sin and shame, misery and strain
What the fuck will tomorrow bring; luck or anthrax
I stand back, hopin I'll make it through tomorrow
[Verse 3: Nas]
My skin is a art gallery, right - with paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benz's and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, 
diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
Fuck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart
, 
my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely...
Hold me, it's gettin' darker
[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Verse 1 - Diddy]
The world at my sneakers
Gold pieces moulded with Jesus features
Give streets the fever from the way I spit the Ether
Came on the scene at 19 a gritty fiend for
Money, power, respect, get it by any means uh
New Yorker, slick talker, walk like a brick flipper
Decimal doctor, multiply to get richer
I'm a entrepreneur, I'm the heart of the city
I'm a part of the sewers, I'm the honorable diddy
I taste the dirt in my sweat, that's from the Harlem struggle
All in my swagger that's the reason why I got my hustle
I got the highest stature, Miami diamond flasher
I got you caught in the most flyest and stylish rapture
My signature next to Christopher Wallace, get it honest
My first album through to him, that was my biggest project
Now I'm the illest known to walk like the illest soldier
And when I smoke, only roll up with the illest doja
You sit and mull it over my venom a killer cobra
It's Harlem USA I diddy bop and shop with Oprah
(Yeah nigga, what.)
[Hook - Cee-Lo]
Nigga what
From my voice I'm killing 'em
I shed my blood
About everything I love
[Verse 2 - Diddy]
To the eye blacker, over handed face the palm smacker
Good scrapper, cat stacker, good wood packer
Tear up the Dom P wrappers faster
Platinum patrone splasher, fuck cris, spit atcha
I call it rich ignorant laughter
Black American express card all grey now, its scratched up
From constant usage, girl kidnapper, pop tags off tags
Poppa making monster music, and still I Costra Nostra
Big roaster, skin cola, girl when I send for ya
Bring friends wontcha?
I'm from the 80's NYC 5 percent of culture
Breeze through with that old school blue malaroma
Wrist glowing, ho-ing, fly off in a Boeing
Slide off with your ho, and spend six figures on her
My persona, Sean John unforgivable cologne
Copping the biggest diamonds makes me sorta bi-polar
Ferrari to Phantom, vehicles for high rollers
The studded chain around my neck makes the night colder
(Yeah nigga, what.)
[Hook - Cee-Lo]
[Verse 3 - Nas]
The Queens Crypt keeper
, 
Mets hat rocker
Pretty bitch slobber, Ex-robber
Heister, 
my own life biographer
Pants sagging, Bentley whipping
Summer jam stopper, Tim truck wearing
Pineapple rocker, then I spray choppers
A doctor in the jungles of Haiti made me
Draped in paisley bandanas
Suits with Adam Stacey
Cigar like Dick Tracy
Its dark I get spacey
Alcohol and laced weed
That was part of my 80's
The Cartier consigieres be near me
Canary yellow cuts in my pinky yearly
Liz Taylor tried to joke me
Cause I keep it green like the other side of Bill Bixby
When he gets mean
Think fast 'fore I blast hoes
Like Grassy Knoll
Went from scraggly old clothes to the illest fashion
And realest rappin'
Pablo bath on the scene, won't go back to no green
Strictly paper cruising through the strip in Vegas
Two of New York's biggest niggas
Y'all used to hate us, but now you love us
Nas and Diddy, power hustlers
(Yeah nigga, what)
[Hook - Cee-Lo]

[Verse 1: AZ]
I'm back, no Belve, just bottles of Don
With the same wordplay that supplied the Qu'ran
Any stagnation, I rise beyond
Get it right, understand my ties are strong
From the streets where it all started, back in school
To the dough stackin' nigga started actin' fool
Used to be the loud type love to flash the jewels
Hit somethin' nice then broadcast the news
Bags of weed, used to slow drag the weed
Did it all in the hood, had to leave
Asthmatic, guess I had to breathe
Short nigga what up, short to grab the 'vees
Blasted for few winters, rejuvenated
Returnin' like you remembered, but more swifter
Stronger than your malt liquor
Money, hoes and clothes, don't let them whores get cha
They not fair
[Refrain x2: Joe]
That's how we bump, that's how we bang
Shorty now we all up on them thangs
Play your part, play the game
And everything is everything
[Verse2: Nas]
My words are my life and my life come with laws
You my brother keeper mean I'd give my life for yours
It's death before dishonor, the rules we would practice
Never play with love, 
love is evil spelled backwards
'
Member the real shit, friend I would build with
Before the Benzs, three quarter trenches it was all friendship
This shit's odd to me, let no one abuse it
Everything's everything niggas I love music
When Donny Hathaway sing I close my eyes slowly
Body get weak, as if I could feel my soul heat
These dudes get jealous, rappers got a lot of change
Can't solidify their own position 'til I'm out of the game
But fuck'em, cause yo "A" this was needed
Cause when we stopped our flow the fake one's succeeded
And "D" this the game bab' bro, nuttin' change, they know
Play Illmatic then listen to them, same flow
[Refrain x2]
[Bridge: Joe]
Bag up your work, hit the block and pitch
Don't stop 'til you rich, bust shots never snitch
Stick to the script, tuck in your chain
And everything is everything
[Verse 3: AZ]
Truth is real, believe I take loot for real
It's the desperation in the dap, boost the wheel
Trucks and 20's, relax when them cups is in me
You can catch me at Justin's or up in Jimmy's
Jeckyl and Hyde, the real never wrestle with pride
If you live, that's the only way I let you inside
Love it or not, thrive off the love of the block
See me solo in a photo, hands huggin' my cock
Frank furvase, a white cotton tank with shades
Taper fade, got a face that just ain't for braids
Been in the mix, sittin' up in cinema six
Multi-complex, go before the end of the flick
It's just me, besides I'm just a G
With the O in the front,
 I know what you want
Believe, I'm sucka-free this one
[Refrain x2]
[Bridge]

Chorus:
Honies, cash, weed, cars
Ghetto celebrities, 'hood movie stars
Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
Went from Nasty to Nas to Nas to Escobar
The path we all walk, starts out long it's like a boardwalk
Monopoly, some make it around, some go down, it's prophecy
Happy days balancing with life's atrocities
Hoppin' in v's, knowin' some day I got to lead properly
High up in a five realizing the price paid
For this life laid in the light shade
One might say, top of the world's two whips, a crib and a girl
Quick to celebrate it, poppin' corks like they made it
Pretentious, arrogant niggas is senseless
Pro ball players with white wives, peep they night lives
While you could catch me in a crisp white five
Dark tinted, dijon-scented, with Al Green on
My theme song, love and happiness, how can it seem wrong
I mean before this, I used to rock a taurus with the donuts
Now I grown up, got it chromed up
Got the rap game sewn up, sho-nuff
Niggas acting cool, but it's really no love
I feel a slow buzz, off the dutch
This is everyday, every second
Got to make it pay, every lesson I learnt
Got me open while most of these rappers'll stay burnt
Chorus 2x (the second time "Honies" changes to Money")
With so much drama in QBC, it's kinda hard being Escobarro
Elderado Red, sippin' Dom out the bottle
My life is like a Donald Goines novel
We wave glasses like bravo
Drunk niggas with mad problems, and shot pockets
My niggas from the block rock this
Box cocaine, cook it and chop it
Looking to profit, in different ways
Goin' through this difficult stage, called life
But each year my physical's praised
Some fell beyond the reach of help
Cut in the street, thinkin' they could teach theyself
When all we wanted was a piece of wealth
And randomly, feed our family
The streets are insanity
Amply, living in ths thug's fantasy
Richest nigga in show biz is what I plan to be
Heavy chain and my QB sway, living this king's life
Magazines write about me, in this dream it's all tight
Chorus 2x (The Second time "Honies" changes to "Money")
Now the main thing that boggle my brain be all the bottles of pain
Iced the chain and all the followers came
They tried to throw me off track, but I caught that
They thought I lost that
But I'm continuing to make more stacks
Halftime, new york state of mind, it was written was hittin'
Trips overseas, southeast, diamond and riches
Sleepin on the plane, wake up when we land feelin' real scared, on the
Ground
Rollie flush, princess cuts, and large rounds
The crews up, findin time to shine rocks
It's real, you violate, be in a pine box
If it go there, I lay you before you lay me, it's crazy
I didn't make the game, the game made me
Records for the babies so they raised up in mansions
Haters keep hating, and ladies'll keep glancing
Yall know the routine out this muthafucka.... word up

[Nas]
Alka Seltzer... in this motherfucker... I gotta take shit
Ay there go my book... I been looking for this book
What, What... Yea
[Nas]
I ain't seen as much death, nor seen as much crime, since the blackout in Queensbridge in 79'
Everybodies a killer now... pimps, playas, and dons
Shorties on the block
, 
push drops and carry on
Niggas look through our window, where ever we drove
Through the tint, to see if the Benz is matching the clothes
We the Queens Kings
I used to view the cats that I owe... see things..
.
That made me real, but my skin and my soul
Girls who turned hoes
Friends who turned foes
Bad luck niggas who bring Death where ever they go
Never sleep, it feels better to know... it's all real though!...
[Hook:]
Everything Is Real... And... Where We Heading Now...
 
Up to more Money... It be More Fun... Leave with Mo' Bitches... and Carry More Guns
Where We Heading Now... Where We Going Yo... Getting Real Son... We Gon let It Flow... Leave with Mo' Bitches... And Be More Dough... It Be More Fun... Holding More...
[Nas]
How the hell, are we supposed to excel from the street.
..
Where the Jakes Crew face young kids who wanna eat
Quantum Leap to this Black World, Hustlers, and Ghettos
Cell mates, millionaires, who tussle with the Devil
Bust a lil metal lead
 (led)
Wrestle you... to the pebbles... on the hard gound
That's if the God's down
It's a struggle, brothers jump bail
To come chill with they niggas on the block, with them rocks for sale
On the hard with the god Shapelle
... a Queens Conrad
Yo run and come with the dime bag
[Shapelle]
Yo, Yo-Yo
Ayo I need dat
I got to smoke dat...
Sell me some Chunky Black
[Nas]
So I could smoke away the pain
Try to find my brain
But the thought still remain
Yo it's on again
Once the jail take these chains
Cause I been through it
The drug game I thought I knew it
I got knocked, went to trial
But I blew it
25... but only lived 20 years of my life
Took 5 from me
Got me wrapped up like a Mummy
Now I'm in the system... aka the Devil's Home
Where they tell you where to eat, sleep, shit, and use the phone
Now I'm living with... drug dealers, and chain stealers...
Bitch niggas, who got knocked and turned squealers
Imagine sharing a cell with a rehabilitated addict
Who love fucking with faggots
But I sip alot of Savage
I sat him down, and made him study mathematics
Now I'm sitting in the cell thinking...
About this reefer I'm a get this weekend
On the V.I. (visit)
I rather be... uh, dam, dam
[Fades Out]

[Nas]
Diamond cut vocals carved sculptures
Gats and holsters, MAC's and four-fifths
Two plagued veracious
We smoke spliffs when the dro's lit hoes get hit
Have them blow dick
, 
blow the whole clique
Jeeps, Tahoe, 
shoes be Salvatore Ferragamo
Catch a homo
, 
guns long like Mutombo
From Atlanta Hawk
, 
rap fans I'mma stalk y'all
While we ban the pork, thought Farrak taught y'all
The god sports all dejoun, four wheel
Push the Range all year, vision a war near
I lay it out for y'all, 
its money and ice
That's how I'm running your wife
Stay whipping that Vipe
Clip in your life, down to pint size
Firm slice pies, couple of trife guys in tinted up white 5
[Nature]
Who's the first to set it?
At times my thirst's pathetic
Nature one of The Firm
, our word's phonetic
At seven digits, first class trips to some I'll never visit
Outlook, remain pessimistic
Used to jostle in hostile environments buying whips
Cheating life out of its requirements
Psychics predict that I'll be dying rich
Until then catch me chilling, flying in a giant six
On some next shit, went from humble, now it's hectic
Reminiscing when they use to call me desperate
Minor drawbacks, I had to learn not to fuck with small cats
And fake cartier and straw hats
Stick them on a mixtape, they think they're all that
But just speeding through, 
never sounding reasonable son
Whatever's the cause I know it's feasible
Bought your way in the game, the rates is seasonable
(Chorus) Nas
If we keep going hard, we're gonna take this money
Take money money take take money money
Take money take take money money
If we just play our part, we're gonna make this money
Make money money make make money money
Make money money make make money
[AZ]
You know how we're living, Firm shit nigga
Yo, circle through the orbit
Stock bonds, I own corporate
Rock velour shit
Filthy rich from Coke endorsements
You must've lost sense
My whole Firm we walk with offense
I push a Porsche bent
Fuck your main bitch of your expense
Laws intense, high ways
Death throughout the tri-state
Who violate? 
'98 Lex, NY plates
Well modernized, wide body cup with foreign eyes
You far behind, I'm rock the reptiles, it's still Karl Kani's
Guard your eyes, mystical movements hard to size
We harmonize and blew force that's way beyond the skies
Love position, parlaying, ducking 
drug convictions
Thug intentions every few months of this mission
Its principles, master my square, no identicals
Invisible, I've figured you wise so play it sensible
(Chorus) Nas X2
(Outro) AZ (Nas)
Yo you see, yo see what we're doing son
You stick 20 and we're making 40 (See how's going down)
And 40 gon' make 80 and 80 gon' 60 son
We're entre-preneuring right now, (It's simple arithmetic)
Grossing development man (Corporate world)
You know what I mean? (I hope they're ready for the Firm niggas)
(They're ready for the Firm niggas?) Man, I don't think so
Son, hold up, pull that, pull that
(I don't think there's no other) They're mosquitoes right now
(I don't think there's no other families out there) The allegiance
(That has the strength to survive in today's game, fo'real?) Ha ha ha
Playing with big boys now, man
You will recognize or feel what we're trying to do
(Millionaires behind bitches) Or either feel what we're trying to do
(Word up)

[Intro: Nas]
Yo this Nas niggas whuttup?
QB Album coming, niggas Ill Will
, Bravehearts
My nigga DJ Clue - put this shit on these niggas
Desert Storm baby 2000!
[Nas]
A Drug dealers dream - flip his last Ki out the game
Cause entertainment money now is off the chain
I put blunts in niggas caskets, lost in the game
I learned about pain, bodies burnt in drug game
But I'm neva gon' die, I neva heard of death
Energy could neva be destroyed
Only the flesh, when you niggas try to murder me
With bullets to my head
This is my you can't kill me niggas
I'm already dead, BRING IT!!
I'm busting bodies fall in the cemetery
Black blood raining on the street
All you niggas, buried y'all
Niggas just came home, fresh out the state greens
Five time felon, thinking he jelling in Queens
It's pitiful - what bid could do, especially federal
Y'all young thugs wilding, see prison
Got a bed for you waiting, I clapped that Satan
But thought I was dreaming
I woke up masturbating in the bed with demons
I cried with every bit of strength of my small body
This is the life I chose, under God I'm tiny
Hard to find me, I popped up, lock shot-up
You can't B.I., see I'm eternal, not luck
You get shot-up, boxed-up next for the grave
Your flow is one dimensional, your level is 2nd grade
You're on top -- WHAT?
Copy and fuck, I said it first, you repeated
Your false crown covered in dirt - defeated
Y'all niggas all hail, the King is dead
He running like a bitch with his tail between his legs
'Stillmatic',
 still eye 4 an eye, 
wanna be God
You're just the next rapper to die, fucking with Nas

[Produced by Havoc]
[Hook x2]
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son
 
your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
[Prodigy]
Let me start from the beginning, at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav, situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya, and leave your corpse
For the cops to discover, while I be dipping in the Range Rover
All jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while 
Jakes
 
trying to knock me and lock me
But I'll be on the low
 
sipping Asti Spumante
Niggas try to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack,
 
it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep letting them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm out of town one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours
 
and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got G's in my pocket hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter soft leather upholestry
But mostly, keep the gat closely cause niggas wanna toast me
[Havoc]
A-yo I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my nine serve purpose
Sling do my thing organize fiend servants
Trying to make a mil is stress you know the deal
So we sling
 
krills
, 
get your cap peeled
, cause everything is real
Cause I wanna chill, laid up in a jacuzzi
Sipping bubbly with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort get caught
Dead up in New York, my brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost never found again my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches,
 
hitting snitches off with mad stitches
Your last resting place'll be a ditch kid
No one can stop me, try your style's sloppy
You want to be me, you're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about making the green
Living up in luxury, pushing phat whips and living comfortably
[Hook]
[Nas]
A

Five hundred SL green

Tailor made ostrich,

New York 
metropolis,

apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds feels like, the 
holy beast is watching us
Mad man my sanity is going like an hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced trying to bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you, niggas who could've killed you
Is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar
 
moving on your weak production
Pumping corruption
 
in the third world

[Raekwon]
Hold up and analyze
 
the wildcats slang cracks
They swingin Ac's
, the new routines, be my eyes black's
Playing corners glancing all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, 
feeling higher than an airplane right
Word yo, 
I want to get this money then blow
Take my time
,

, if you front you go
Sip beers, the German ones

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together son your beef is mines
So long as the sun shine can light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
[Verse 1: Prodigy]
First of all the foundation, money is the root of all evil
The cream will have you shitting on your people
Living like lotto, everything is everything
Ain't nothing changed but the clothes that my money bring
I'm Making figures that I never thought was possible
You try to slow me down you'll find yourself in the hospital
My crew got the army of Tec-xuses and the Mac-uras
Kid you'll get your cap peeled backwards
For years, I've been trying to blow for years
Getting bent off Moëts, spending a G on beers
Living life to the fullest, my story ends with a bullet
Til the coke oil drop to the bottom of the pot
My invincible crew will never stop
If you looking, you can find me rising to the top
I'm a classic, approach my level and get your ass kicked
Floating in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
Im trying to make a half a million triple in size
Before my eyes, another part of my team died
I can still hear his voice while he up in the sky
While the rest still living steady telling me lies
It's like a bad dream and I can't wake up
But at the same time I love it and I can't give it up
[Verse 2: Havoc]
I got your life in arms reach, With a slug for each and any
The clip is filled up I'm hitting til its fucking empty
Presenting, the hollow tip crew, take heed to the message that we sending at you
Choking off your own blood watch you face turn blue
Ain't that some shit, the damage that a bullet can do
Make you change the way you thinking, niggas speed while you blinking, too late
On your way home, you left a trail leaking
I bet you next time you'll listen up while I'm speaking
Now you're laid up in ICU for the weekend
At the same time I'm outside getting my thug on
The same eyes got my mind fucking bugging
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
A drug dealer's dream
Stash CREAM keys on a triple beam
Five hundred SL green, ninety-five nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor made ostrich, Chanel for my women friend
Murdering, numbers on your head while I'm burglaring
Shank is serving 'em, what's up to all my niggas swerving in

Nas Escobar moving on your weak production
Pumping corruption in the third world we just busting
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
My teams hot collecting mad cream, we slingshot
My ring's rock icy
 like a fuck with a green drop
Call me santa with more snow than montana
Camouflage Wu emblem on my bandana
Play fair sight, never in a million these cats bite
Folding under pressure like beach chairs
Drug money, hundred dollar nights plus flights around the way
Burning biggys on bikes its only right
Two for fives 95, five 25s didn't I
Rewind glaciers mixtape niggas throwing eyes
Check dates, my whole crew making they Tec's spray
Shooting ninas off sideways we know it
[Hook]
Verse 5: [Ghostface Killah]
Beat downs galore, kids walk away holding they jaws
Wishin they had drawers, tossed posters plus sneaky stores
Balls be gettin licked kid on whatever airline
Restroom style courtesy from stewardess, the bitch washed mine
Sell box nine never been popped, now his bill's shocked
It's real it be hittin me things def made the store hot
Jewels link, niggas beam, whole team labelled wally king
Goldie poured a beer, Johnny's man dot him with the green
World's greatest, Las Vegas played us, rap crusaders
Casino champs, Gods sport the latest
Today's math, fuck nuthin but ass, take Cristal baths
Go half on his robbery, we run up on Johnny Cash
Kid's invicible, back to back screws, Wu's suspenseful
You get lynched, starks will play it cool
Like a man, like a night out, whitey's callin me like a double date
Alkies get his shank so it's wine inside Hostess cakes
Yo my man, check the marble or get deaded
You bust a shot and the big bullet was unleaded
Word up
[Hook]

The time has come, we gotta expand, the whole operation
Distribution, New York, to Chicago, L.A
We gotta set our own market, and enforce it
[Verse 1: Kool G Rap]
Champagne wishes and caviar dreams
 
a team that's gettin' cream
With sales of fish scales from triple beams
 I gleam
Livin' the life of Riley
 packin' fifty calis
Rockin lizard Bally's while we do our drug deal in a dark alley
Up in casinos just me and my dino primo
Pushin beam-o's then parlay in Reno with two fly latinos
Nas, he runs the whole staff, we count math from steam baths
We've seen a half a milli dashin out there on the Queens half
Three major players gettin papers by the layers
And those that betray us on the block get 
rocked like Amadeus
Fakers get used to shootin targets, soon as the dark hits
Front on the drug market, bodies get rolled up in a carpet
Those that cheat us try to beat us we got hookers with heaters
That'll straight pop and put 
more shells in your top than Adidas
Da leaders, lookin straight charming in our 
Giorgio Armani's
You wanna harm me and Nas you gots ta conquer through a whole army
The cee-lo rollers
, money folders, 
sippin' Bolla
, 
holdin mad payola
Slangin that Coke without the Cola
Me and black 
don't fake jacks
 but we might sling one
It ain't no shame in our game we do our thing son
[Chorus (x2)]
Livin' the Fast Life, in fast cars
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
A team from out of Queens
 with the American Dream
So we're plottin' up a scheme to get the seven figure cream
[Verse 1: NaS]
Yo I got, guns from Italy, smoke trees, considerably
Mid-state and Green it seems, is where all my niggas be
The ghetto misery
, 
shootouts
 
and liquor stores
A perpendicular, angle of the clout war
Police searchin' up my Lexo
 but who's petro
My tech blows straight off the roof and tests yo' respect though
But dough don't respect me, it got me handcuffed
The rough life, I just be up nights, breathin' with scuffed Nike's
Pour my beers for my peoples under the stairs
These years I got they names in my swears
Poppin Cristal like it's my first child
, 
lickin shots, holiday style
Rockin Steele sweaters, 
Wallabee down
Twenty-four carats, countin cabbage, like the arabs
The marriage of me and the mic is just like magic
Elegant performance, bubble Lex full insurance
Guzzlin Guinness shootin 
catchin cases concurrent
It's Nas, seven hundred wives, King Solomon size
We on the rise, me and G,
 
ghetto wise guys
The Luciano, Frankie Yale, Bugsy Siegel
Green papers with eagles from a trade that's illegal
*singer* 
Brother you've got to make it happen
Yeahhhahhyeahhh, get this money, yeahhh
Brother you've got to make it happen
When you're living in the fast life, heyy yeah yeah
[Verse 3: G Rap & Nas]

Aiyyo my lifestyle's exquisite, yayo like a blizzard

Esquire attire
 standin on ground with one pivot

Two players rockin silk blazers and diamonds like glaciers

Lands with namebrand seats reclinin like in spaceships
[Rap] Bodies on ice

Livin trife,
 
rollin fixed up dice

Gamblin Grants

[Nas] 
My bankrolls, got the cops comin in plain clothes
[Rap] Tryin to arraign again cause of our fame that's how the game goes
[Nas] True
[Rap] 
Right out the slammer with the fame and glamour
Cookin up grams with Arm & Hammer supplyin scramblers in Alabama
[Nas] 
Rub out faces and leave no traces
My aces got mad body cases, 
preserve spaces at the horse races
Servin us Dom P my cliquo
Dimes with magnifico, puttin' in cut inside 
perico
Heat for foes
, shoppin sprees with my fleet for clothes
In Carribean suites, deep, rippin beats with flows
[Rap] Aiyyo, we went from standin on blocks, without some socks
Sellin rocks, to pickin up stock and boat docks with Glocks
And got poppy seed fields with million dollar bills
Packin all the blue steel
 we keeps it real inside the battlefield
[Nas] Yeah so here's a toast to the funds and things
Gun smokes in rings, 
graveyards is buried with kings
[Chorus]
*singer does same part again with variations to fade, mostly "I" for "you*

[Intro: Scarface]
Yo Nas
I don't think they wanna FUCK with this
.. fo' sho'
("
.. danger..")
[Verse 1: Scarface]
Check it out
It's on, and once again I bring niggas the rough
Fuckin with us, that get you motherfuckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports Rally
Beatin up the block, leavin these motherfuckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Comaneci
Now dey a motherfuckin see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggas in New York
Comin kama-kize, sparkin this shit that keep me off the heezee
Game over
, 
he with my man came over
To scoop me, blowin dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherfuckers what we came for
Tell these niggas why we here
[Verse 2:Nas]
Nuttin but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin, think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
That's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like
, 
Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggas, come through for niggas
Scarface get a call and we shootin niggas
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin to make future figures, we 
, what?
[Hook: Nas]
You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it
[Verse 3: Scarface]
You say you got a problem? Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherfuckin cap
Where his brother go to school at? Find out some more information
Bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'mma pull the motherfuckin plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded
, 
I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherfuckin mind
Him and whoever standin by, I'll tell these niggas, "Let's go"
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin up his own blood
With a slug in his motherfuckin mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Nas]
A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
's ready, 
, 
Attack em like Freddie,
 
then we toastin over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin 
same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
With a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa
[Hook]
[Outro]
A favor for a favor
A favor for a favor
A favor for a favor

[Intro: Mary]
Turn the track up a little bit
We need to rock in here
I wanna make you happy
[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm not at all happy or elated, this category ain't my favorite
It's my story, I'mma state it, you could love it or hate it
I'm just a misfit blessed with good dick and intelligence
Hood nigga holding no grudges on petty shit
I started, why are we cold-hearted, so guarded
Scared to get hurt, trying not to love the hardest
That's garbage, remember when we loved each other
Bathtub scrubbed each other, chillin', champagne spillin'
Uh, feelin' like the shit gon' last forever
Time went so fast, we had a blast together
Laughs we had, friends we spent time with
Now I be seeing your friends out, then I'm reminded
How we all used to gather up for the holidays
Now your friends all nervous to speak, they act afraid
I was your bestie, how it get to this
As I reminisce, takin' off my MJs in my empty crib
Mary...
[Verse 2: Mary]
I wanna make you happy
But you just don't see it
I wanna be around, babe
But I'm so tired of competing
We say all the wrong things
Till we make each other cry
What are we doing?
Will it ever get better?
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
Boy, I love you
But you're pushing me away
[Hook: Mary]
I gave you everything that I got
Watched my feelings walk on by
Ever get sick of trying?
This is how I feel inside
[Verse 3: Mary]
Now I was hoping
We'd get through this together
You said you'd love me
Through all types of stormy weather
Wasn't it you who said
We'd be together for all time
But it keeps messing with my mind
My heart, my soul
I gave, it's yours
I can't get back
All the things that I lost
I need you here near me
But I can't make you stay
[Hook]
[Bridge: Mary]
I never thought that I would have this feeling
Do you think for once that you can truly mean it
Wasting so much time disagreeing
See, I'm to the point where I don't know what I believe in
[Verse 4: Nas & Mary]
[Nas]
If you don't want this, I don't want this, I do my morning crunches
Play my jazz, pray to the east, and watch the sunset
Uh, but yet I was blowin' you up the other night
Could tell your girl was telling you what to write back
Tell me why it's like that
[Mary]
So make up your mind, boy decide
We can't go on like this, this ain't right (it ain't right)
Feeling really bad, feeling kinda low
Think it's time to go
[Hook]

Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...
[Verse 1]
I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came from behind the sun, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, 
first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind
[Hook: Nas]
I shot my way out my mom dukes
[Verse 2:]
They must wanna keep me, cause 4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, 
mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, 
hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world
, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna stop
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off
 and he said 
"At least that nigga ain't ugly!"
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherfuckers...

[Intro: Nas]
I want y'all to see this like film
C-Sick on production, Nas on the vocal.. let's go
[Verse 1: Nas]
Lots of fog at night, red brake lights
The freeway beside a restaurant
Cold egg whites sat on my plate like
3 AM, this is a spot frequented by some made men
I'm high on hemp
A fly old pimp just walked in, his suit was shark skin
He woke me up from some of the thoughts I'm lost in
What fame does to niggas, change love to bitterness
Friends to fiends for the audience screams, ridiculous
Jumped up, paid my tab, got in my Benz and went
To my old housing tenement, visit my old friends
Some show love and some are envious
Some got the heart of gold, some venomous
At times I wanna go back to being penniless
Ignorance is bliss, I love being innocent
Ugh, but life's got me on the fence again
And all is real so all's worth mentioning
[Hook: Ultra Naté (sampled)]
If I could press pause, or fast forward past the hardness
Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with
Memories real, still ill, now I appear crisp like film
[Verse 2: Nas]
Ice on gold from mossbergs
 to golf clubs
Ninth hole, the white rose, the life I chose
Bandanna over the eye, Dior sandals
Car doors rise with no touch of the handles
Capiche? Caprese salad’s on beaches and islands
Far from police sirens at least for a weekend
Then it's back to the streets creepin
I'd like to make a free toast of champagne on behald of this nigga speaking
Add a splash to the Seagrams
Roll the hash for my world renowned goons this evening
As I circle the table like Babe Ruth
Louisville Slugger in my grip for a fake dude
Bat to the brain with brute force
Splatter my cream velour suit
They hit me with lawsuit
I slip in your whore coupe
Your bitch hate you, word to Jesus
Bet you never knew she toot yay and play with a gay crew
OGs hate to make way for the new
Young niggas want Polo ain't fucking with J Crew
It's safe to say I was once young and innocent
But look what I know now, is all worth mentioning
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
I speak to the street life
The executive chief types
The felons, young mothers with kids they trying to feed right
The botega wearers modern day Che Guevaras
Cuz I barely survived crazy eras
Honest, always make good on my promise
I don't talk it I do it you can hold me to it
I was born to this life I didn't invent it
But I'd be wrong not to take a few meal tickets
You and I are real different, we don't share the same beliefs
Fight in the ring or buy ringside seats
Either you like beef, or you like to spectate
Give me gloves, and I'mma do it how the refs say
We touch em and we come out tussling
The ghetto is my garden of eden
So I keep bobbing and weaving
It's intense so I'm hardly breathing
KO, and the winner is Nas, that's how the scene ends
[Hook]

[Nas]
Crime, life, bitches, money
Time..
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times..
From "Breaking Atoms" to "Illmatic", to goin platinum
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence,
 and 
wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin niggas mistakes, visits at niggas wakes
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate
[Hook]
Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggas never wanna see you with it, FUCK THEM THO'
Niggas can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do
[Nas]
Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket
Or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
We use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
Less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco 
in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
How much it cost, Korean man brushin me off
For some other big time customer, probably a hustler
Who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, "I'll be just like you soon, motherfucker what?"
[Hook]
[Nas]
To them niggas who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
You first time in you known for poppin your toast
By your third year in you forgotten by most
Niggas wife cut them out of they life, niggas don't write
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
It be ill, niggas coming home and no time, they get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
In they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
In the projects, who gon' die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggas know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro
[Hook]
[Nas]
Feel me?
One time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh
What what what? Uhh uhh uhh..

[Verse 1: AZ]
The six ease out CD laced digital readout
No doubt cop Glocks from the dred fuck the weed house
Yo elegance hate females with no intelligence
Embezzlement got big boys behind the
 
metal fence
Merrill Lynch it's your life 
Crist
 alright
Vince on ice 
sex chicks, all types
General status smoothness mixed with malice
Trips to Dallas built a pool in my palace
Who want what from more moneys I want a cut
Extorting start from the corner step on us up
Sixty inch screen laserdisc with the beam
It's my life I'm holding the dice don't intervene
I send a team, to smash out your whole plans
No cold hands liquid or hunger to hold grands
From state bids to large cats who lace cribs
It's Firm Biz, y'all know what time it is
[Hook: Dawn Robinson]
I'm talking Firm Biz to you baby (Firm Firm Biz)
Talking bout the Firm, that is (Firm Firm Biz)
I'm talking Firm Biz to you baby (Firm Firm Biz)
Talking bout the Firm, that is that is
That is that is Firm Biz!
[Verse 2: Nas]
Peep the stee
, creeping with AZ
B-12's crazy,
 
I ball with The Firm's first lady
I brawl with those who hate me, make me spray y'all;
 hoping for the day I fall
Never that though Black 4 4's for fedz
Like Donnie Brascoe
 so peep the cappos
Who mack most splash it up with lactose
Pretty thug style
, I blow you out slug style
Bent in the Caddy Coupe me and Daddy Duke
He schooled me on how to stand on my own two
He said son it's all kinda shit you gon' go through
Either you gon' make it or you gon' fall too
Now we headline tours, remember me I told you that the world was yours
Married to the Firm laws
Esco bless flows y'all know me, laced in the Sony Firm be the hottest click to blow G
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
My pops uesd to warn me, never fall victim to the horny
Keep the pussy tight, stay that bitch
If I'm gon' fuck lay that dick
Tony get him for his chips and pray he push a six
Now I got game to make the thuggish niggas scream my name
Hope the panties drop only if I cop
The baby blue drop gotta keep my wrist iced
The baddest bitch yeah the sex is alright
Lace 'em all night going to the crib
Jumping out the range in the iceberg tights
Yeah I know about the five and its one shut eye
360 wave spinning cat thinking he Nas
From now 'til the day we shining, keep my diamond
Esco with me in the E reclining top dogs
The illest duo since the Boss name was Hugo
AZ Firm trio stay on the lee low
[Hook]

[Intro One: Nas Escobar]
As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be in the Firm
I can remember when I first met Sosa, it was a glorious time
There were wise guys everywhere, we were around
Twenty one, twenty two at the time
Yeah every place we go, every party
People would stop and stare when we walked in
We would give the doorman a hundred dollars just for opening the door
Sosa would give the bartender two hundred dollars
Just for keeping the ice cold
Yeah we were legends.. and we still are legends
[Verse One: AZ the Vizuliza]
Two hundred fallen angels, we ballin from every angle
Heavy bag gold, Panamanian chains dangle
Let's tangle, tabernacles, Elohim's coming at you
Fuck parables, a billion years B.C., originally black Jews
Cashews honey now roasted, let's kill the colprate
He owe us shit, toe toe toe with that four four bit
Fuck the ho shit, mercury back tax the birth of me
Personally I existed when Earth was in need, indeed
Human lifeform transformed from light storms, protons
Electrons nuetrons
, iced long
Nights long, reptilians, I'll see ya'll in the next millenium
What world are we really in, amphibians moved to the Carribean
Underwater force, 
placed under the court of law
Usually sport Warlaw, my mind stay core raw
Fill of ambiants, love fine carats and cars that launch
Nonchalaunt, usually there are Jimmies up in the palms
Play low style, Guteians change my whole profile
Left the dope pile, bet the guard be around for awhile
Firm Islamic, hit the croner of the Earth just like a comet
[Intro Two: AZ the Vizuliza]
See I like Esco, he knew everybody and everybody knew him
He was the type of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies
But hey
[Verse Two: Nas Escobar]
Die for this Firm, live for this Firm
Niggas learn, never should come before your fam
From ki's to ported grams, these are corners in the blue van
E's upon on us, cause of warrants
While we smoke hash cheese enormous, stack cheese
Travel the world like Taurus
, went half with Sosa for four bricks
Down in Camden
, 
we handlin' to D.C
Chips on fights with China White's by they tight PP
Wanting PC but all they get is good dick or four clips
For loose lips, by the jungle flips
Suck the pearl tongue juices, off your fly misses
Take her out to the Spark's steakhouse, gentleman style
Coincidental, family's here
Meet fem fatale, French connection
Persian wet don, let's get this "F" on
The Ebony queen, Fox you grab my left arm
Dre made it, Ice Cube and Compton, BK and so on
Family strong Consigliere Nature
Makin sure we all get this millionaire's paper
What a sweet site for sour eyes, may we all rise
Hope for now on we never cross sides
[Veres Three: Foxy Brown]
You know what, most hoes would have left these cats a long time ago
I mean if your man gave you a gun to hide, what would ya'll hoes do?
But you know, the shit kinda turned me on
Black Madonna
, hoes kill for they popals
Never seen a bitch like this, queen misses
Rock BDS's on the left wrists, trick check this
Respect this, Firm's niggas lie knee deep in this bitch
Wanna need bitch and have my pussy bleed, swear for 'em
Fuck and take the chair for 'em, whoever dare cross us
The thoughts that thoughts across a bitch's minds, pops the nine
Leave 'em resting in peices, while my thorough bitches peep this
Death before decid-a, screw me on the dick-a
Lace me in Gabanna, peep dat
Think I'm flippin' on these three cats
Set yo clown ass right up with my down ass
Bitch to hold the cash and G's, stash the guns for 'em
And the icedy E Berkee, breathe the the sun for 'em
Long dick style, swallow the enemies cum for 'em
Pretty ass ho, bitches fuck 'em and I dumb on 'em
When Nas pop the Crist
, Fox cops the fifth
Make my doe up for OZ's, now hoes that's real uhhh

[Produced by No I.D.]
[Verse 1: Big Sean]
Coming from a city where bullets turn bro's into souls
Who knew from that concrete that a rose had arose
Good girls stopped being good when I turned 'em into hoes
Dreams stopped being dreams when I turned 'em into goals
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
Then I saw Kanye's hanging from his gold necklace
Then Ye gave me mine, that show you my work ethic
Mom had that hooptie that she ran in the dirt
Used to pick me up from school, man, right after work
Now she rolling up in that Caddy like she coming to church
She asked why I rock all this gold, cause I'm coming in first
Got the streets behind me like I was staring in the rear-view
Used to have to take showers standing in the mildew
Now I'm in the penthouse, look at what a mill do
Looking in the mirror and I'm still you, I'm still you
[Hook]
Got my first chain
Feeling like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
[Bridge]
BIG was the first one that had it
Now Jacob the Jeweler benefit from my habits
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
[Verse 2: Nas]
What's the noise all about with this rap stuff?
I can say I never been punked, robbed or smacked up
I can say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
I learned to patch it up to get passes to niggas who be acting up
Cause it's a mental game
I learned that when I got my first initial chain
I didn't fake it, it was gold plated
, 
I was posing relatin'
To those dealing with blow, had the big gold, bold anchors it was those gangsters
That bonus, that culture, those projects
Shiny shit on their necks, making both of my eyes squint
They got in my bones, now I'm copping stones
Sorry Sierra Leone, one day we'll right the wrongs
18 karat gold Cuban on
Not too short, not too wide, not too long
My pendant offensive, in the truest form
Platinum gold, rose gold, what you want?
[Hook]
[Bridge]
BIG was the first one that had it
Then I saw Nas' chain, man, that was illmatic
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
[Verse 3: Big Sean]
On a highway to heaven, look at all the tolls I paid
I done gave my city drive all the roads I paved
No matter what way I turn things go my way
I'm rocking chains everyday, so you know I slave
Even when I'm just walking 'round the crib, nigga
To remind me of everything that we did, nigga
Look up in the mirror, chain only thing lyin'
No heroes where I'm from, bullets only thing flying
I know the higher that I go, the harder to climb
But after that, the bigger the muscle and smarter the mind
Police only work 12-hour shifts
Cause in Detroit that's cheaper than the bailout, bitch
Trap house built brick by brick
, 
paid dues on dues
FF, GOOD, you know I'm reppin' crew on crews
Stack bills on bills till my backyards got pools on pools
Girls on girls, lingerie and Moulin Rouge
God damn, I think I'm gon' O.D
Off this asparagus and bread and pasta
Need a doctor
, 
I've been dogding shady hoes and rainy days
It's like I got a built-in doppler
And it's a shame, a fuckin' shame
I don't remember my first love or my first time prayin'
But remember my first ass and the first time she came
It almost felt as good as when I got my first chain
[Hook]
[Bridge]
Jay-Z taught me money ain't a thing
Came from the streets, headed to the hall of fame
And I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
I be stunting, stunting like I got my first chain
[Verse 4: Kid Cudi]
It's such a wonderful thing, to see the end of all things
Niggas and bitches, where you at?
I got my mind is on me, a couple others and dreams
Would've seen me and my niggas in this bitch
About two months in a week's time
Went from feelin hellish to godly with lemon-lime shine
Now how the fuck can I chill now?
 
Kanye think I'm dope
See this piece that I own now, how sick is the rope?
Taking life for what it is,
 the troublesome chick
Who throws fists; 
sometimes it's the weather
Things switch up, people trip up
The money come down, then climb up, but when it come again
The most creepin', deceivin', men are scheme-schemin'
Saying that you love me, I surely hope and if you don't
Motherfuck that sometimes, so dead it
Shred it; 
young nigga lost to the night
I'm so ready to let it go
, 
my life is fucking awesome
I could be fuckin' dead right now
 
but I'm awesome
So fuck whoever has a bad thought
 
don't know the god
Cause when I leave this bitch you all gon' wish you knew the God
It might be too late, but the songs will live on
Just know this fact, you were all wrong
Now watch me do my silly dance, not really a dance
More like a prance
 - 
I'm signing off with a crotch grab
[Outro: Kid Cudi]
Thank you man. for letting me get on this record Sean
You the coolest
GOOD music nigga forever
Understand? Yahm

[Verse 1]
Amazing man
Got a letter from an Asian fan
He asked, "was I black, was I gon' play Japan soon?"
Wrote back, "Yes"
 
danced in the shower, got dressed
Old school, powdered my neck
I give, but I'm selfish
Tattoo of my chick lips on my pelvis
Well it's the pubic part, excuse me y'all
I think that I became musical
Way before rap I did wanna be the tap dance kid
On Broadway, 42nd Street, legendary
Three card Monte, now see him drive the Harley
Now, FYI, for your info
Insects splattered on the bike window
Tatted innuendo
Just last night, don't know where it came from
Guess it's from a past life
Am I charismatic enough?
Does my charm reach people that could make a change?
If I shoot with straight aim at the positive target
And swooed him to make a deposit into my account
Would that be progress?
I doubt
[Hook]
Something is fishy, something is bothering me
I just can't figure it out
Something right under my tongue, I can't speak it
Can't spell it, yo it's bugging me out
Somebody doin' something wrong to somebody I know
Somehow it's related to me and now I'm frustrated
Cause now I'm focusing too hard
On something that's just too plain to see
[Verse 2]
San Juan yeah radiate, conscience clear
About to have a monstrous year
Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep 
ladies
Get ya harder than termite teeth
C'est la vie
, I'm engaged
But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me
And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue
That was put there by the squad
Look here, I'm the god on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ashe with a tennis rack, tell the DJ to spin it back
Yeah, somethin' like that
Uh, it go
San Juan yeah, radiate, conscience clear
About to have a monstrous year
Live in the spot, yeah, err night, deep ladies
Get ya harder than termite teeth
C'est la vie, I'm engaged
But the crew came to play, they fly free, check me
And they wrist is froze, like toes on a body in the morgue
That was put there by the squad
Look here, I'm the god on the mic on the track
Like Arthur Ash with a tennis rack
, 
tell the, nah
Everything I be in
Creme de la creme from the linen to the gold front rim
Cold stuntin'
Take a look around, what you found?
Like Master Ace, tell me the world's a bastard place
High school students will slash your face
And these white nigga hoods, I'm talkin'
'Puter rage is real
Get excited when I'm walkin'
Cause I'm used to dark shades and a limousine tint
Business managers scare me half to death
When they tell me every month what is ? being spent
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I don't like when my girl try to pull a MC Lyte
Jumped out the whip, through the train
Leave me like D Nice
They say we used to resemble each other
Both last name Jones so we must be brothers
My yearly salary suffers
Cause I hate work, no play make Jack lame
And I rock parts on my head that are hotter than yours
Hot rosado lines, designs your barber can't draw
Posters of Nas on the barbershop doors
Entourage, security galore
When was the last time you rode by yourself, superstar?
Got so much love I shot Cupid in the heart
I'm awakened by my own screams
Lucifer masturbated in my dreams
It means somebody is gonna get fucked in the worst way
And none of y'all hoes touchin' my wordplay
Janitors and men with eighty mil both feel the same grief
The men at work, blue collars of the old men
Shinin' shoes, shoe polish go through the same dramas
They wish for a better tomorrow
I thought only five percenters are conspiracy theorists
Thinkin' what the new world order thing is
But everybody does
The fear of the planet is contaminatin everybody's blood
Triliteral, Democratic parties
Anglo-American military alliance
Study at Oxford, scholars, they watchin'
NASDAQ, Dow Jones, got the world stocks in a shamble
Procter and Gamble
Toxins demand you understand who plans to jam you
Some random thoughts by the candlelight in Paris
As I struggle to be savvy
[Hook]

[Intro - Nas]
Yeah
Nas, Emeli... Rudimental
Just Tryna' find my way home
Home sweet home
Uh
[Verse 1 - Emeli Sandé]
I don't do yoga, never tried Pilates
Not many people want me at their parties
Tryna find my place, some place, oh I, oh I, oh I
I drink a little more than recommended
This world ain’t exactly what my heart expected
Tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I
[Hook - Emeli Sandé]
See, whoa, c’est la vie
Maybe something’s wrong with me
But, whoa at least I am free, oh oh I am free
[Verse 2 - Emeli Sandé]
If you ask the church then I am no believer
Spend Sundays asleep I’m just another dreamer
Still tryna find my home sweet home, oh I, oh I, oh I
I guess I ain’t too good for money neither
I got two left feet, no, I’m no Jackson either
Just tryna find my way someway, oh I, oh I, oh I
[Hook - Emeli Sandé X2]
See, whoa, c'est la vie
Maybe something's wrong with me
But whoa at least, I am free
Oh oh I am free
[Verse 3 - Nas]
The lord said vengeance is mine
So with your duplicitous mind
You gotta be insane not to see
You want the game to be what the game cannot be
It's a heavy chain that locks he who cannot mentally be free
So they years for eternity
I don't let nothing worry me
My boy just came home from serving three
Years, His girl loves someone else and he fears
He's gon[na] do something else to someone
To put himself back in the trap
Coz he couldn't adapt
And the streets
Only in jail he feels free
It's so sorry
Just tryna' find my way home
Home sweet home
Yeah...
[Emeli Sandé]
I drink a little more than recommended
Coz this ain't exactly what my heart expected
[Nas]
It's okay though
It's ok
We gonna be alright
We gonna be alright
Let's go
[Hook X2]
[Nas]
C'est la vie
Yeah such is life
[Emeli Sandé]
Maybe something's wrong with me
[Nas]
Ain't nothing wrong with you
Yeah
I am free
I am free
Again
[Outro - Nas]
Let's find our way home:
Nas, Emeli, Rudimental
[Hook]
[Nas]
I am free... Yeah

Yo Funk Flex

Gat slingers now rap singers are who we are
From Nasty to Nas, Nas to Escobar
Y'all know this shit right

Get high tonight
Funk Flex right
My first tool 22s
I hung with crews and rocked funny jewels
Gold chains, Halloween
We bombed Sunday schools
First blunts, cuttin' class
First wifey had me nuttin' fast
Used to brag about who I had
Always wore a bag on my dick
Pants sagged on my kicks
Converse weapons, yellow, and purple magics
Bird had that black shit
Shorties jumpin' on mattress
'97, pockets is fat
, 
rock a stocking cap
Under Yankee hats
God, painted me black, thanks for that
I'm original man
Show improve the mack move right in my hand
Blow dro, murderer, M.O., gone for O
Tinted window, hennessy XO, fuckin' wit Esco
Heavy metal can wet you, yo bless you
Jail niggas go ta hell quicker
Lick you wit that hunting shot
Rockin VVS rocks, stylin, wildin
Peace to Queensbridge housin
Congratulate flex, five-hundred thousand sold
Fuckin' better than gold, nigga

[Havoc]
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Island hoppin getting right on them 747 Boeings
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
That can get that close to me, keep it type strong
Blowing green that's keeping us going
Unconditional love showing
40th side, 41st side ride
[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns
And that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearing the same shit for days
Not caring, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, I don't give a fuck in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggas, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the top rap niggas, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, putting out them songs
Knowing that my niggas come strong, so let's get it on
We just getting warm, operation Quiet Storm
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Hav, P, and Nas, got it in the smash, fo'sho
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career stop at
[Verse 2: Nas]
Ayo I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You violate, they read your obituary in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coat hangers, got loot with dope slangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rastas, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
Fuck being trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
D's on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big White boys with guns yelling, freeze Black kids
Got my niggas in the pen, eating octopus
Wishing they was on the blocks with us
To watch me and P do it, put the heat to it
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
And think deep to it, now who the truest
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Dirty fingernails, reaching in my pocket pulling knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
Out this lifestyle we live, iced-out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason being we ain't all rich
And I'mma be that same nigga for the door
And I'mma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggas out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus, kid
Rap niggas shit they drawers
[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggas, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listening hard
To my thugs in the prison yard, bench-pressing 200 pounds and up
Feeling like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, being looked at, it's uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggas get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
No heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggas move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggas get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest we hit you
[Hook]
[Outro]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Forty decide, 
Forty-First side
 right
Yeah youknahmsayin
Not for nothing baby
Knahmsayin wanna give a shout out to my peoples
YouknowhatImean, Yambo, Ill Will
Killa Black, my brother
It's never gonna be another, word up
Yeah, you know how we do things
[Skit]
The future is nothing but a series of probability made up of decisions that we make right now but these decisions leads to certain events into the future and every human being has a capability to determine their own future some are just more into it than others

[Intro: Nas]
Lord Lord y'all, what I'm gonna do?
Lord Lord y'all, Shit is all true
[Nas]
Mmm... Fried chicken,
 
fly vixen
Give me heart disease but need you in my kitchen
You a bird but you ain't a ki'
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats
All the way from Kentucky to fuck with me
Look what you done to me, was number one to me
After you shower, you and your gold medal flour
Then you rub your hot oil for about a half an hour
You in your hot tub I'm looking at you salivatin'
Dry you off I got your paper towel waitin'
Lay you down cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock to the bed then plop!
When we done I need rest
Don't know what part of you I love best
Your legs or your breast
Mrs. Fried Chicken, you gonna be a nigga death
Created by southern black women to serve massa' guest
You gonna be a nigga death
Mrs. Fried Chicken you was my addiction
Dripping with high cholest-
Like Greeks with his falafel, Italian with his to-mato pasta
What roti is to a rasta
Trapping me; You and your friend mac' and cheese
Candy yams, collard greens
 but you knocking me to my knees
It's killing me when I'm inside
Nothing I need more than a fish fry
[Busta Rhymes]
Shit, it taste good I can't lie
It's like you're walking out the tanning salon
When I pull you out the oven from baking I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty HamHock
It's so feminine the way you submitted and how you gave me power
To massaging me to shower you with lemon water
Marinate you with seasoning and dipping you in chowder
Baby it's like you at the spa the way you gently lay in the pan
While enjoying your butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling on your skin
Despite the funny fragrance still I lick my finger frequent
In any event, I'm reflecting on all the signs
That I got saying that I shouldn't fuck with you
But the way you that you would taste made you hard to resist
When I put my mouth on you but that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach, when I laid eyes on you
Or was it infection manifesting
Confused over the feeling
, 
impatiently eating you
Trichina worm chewing on the wall of my intestine
I'm a eat you until there's nothing left
Until my very last breath, you gonna be a nigga death
Despite I prepare it the best specialize in cooking swine as a chef
You gonna be a nigga death
Who cares if the swine is mixed with rat, cat and dog combined
Yes, I'm a eat the shit to death
Ain't that some shit
I'm a eat some shit until what I'm eating kills me
And I choose to do that, why?
Cause that's just what niggas do

[VERSE 2 - Nas]
Only talking with winners
A loser or two
Got my number
Still they think they real
But they just really awfully bitter
Salty niggas
Hate the smarter ones
These are the doubters
Who sour 'bout my run
I barely made it out the slums
My value high
Cause I do more than
Rap about a gun
I made money for niggas
Ya'll never looking out for none
I helped millionaires get to that very position
Some real millionaires see that's ill
Cause look at statistics
Real millionaires
And I ain't talking ghetto riches
Thorough business
You mistreating niggas
Heard your folks bleed in prison
You ain't a G
And if you was
I don't recall
Who would roll with ya'll
Buncha fucking know it alls
Who's dough is small
Look what's it come to
Our rapport's good no more
We was good before
Till I saw what type a dude you took me for
We had a chance to take paper down
What I took was more
Because of hatred
Opportunity wasted
[Hook 3 - JR. GONG]
Your real friends will serve you long

Your real friend won't do you wrong
Real friend don't change Eh

[VERSE 4 - Nas]
May laughter
From backstabbers
Turn to tears faster
I wish for you
No snake shall slither past ya
You have to
Keep your vision clear
Cause only a coward lives in fear
My surroundings
Got only real powerful niggas here
Real men we have a code of ethics
No question
No jealousies
No feminine tendencies
We expecting
No gossip
No phony logic
No counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense for legal defense
If your homey locked up
No keeping tabs
On who was the last who looked out
Selfishness
That's a character flaw
No holding out
Yo what happened to the honor
You're dealing with
Sensitive Primadonna drama
Teflon love
For my dudes who solid
[Hook 5 - JR. GONG]
Your real friends will serve you long

Or emptily
With arm in arms
We'll all trod on
Through destiny

Respect is due
They care for me
Should I be down
Or even out
They're next to me
Hey

[Intro: Ice Cube]
Blame me... (*echo*)
[Interlude: Ice Cube]
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow (*echo*)
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R A W - R A W
[Ice Cube]
You're looking at the Grand Wizard
War lord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothing like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothing like man that you knew on the corner
Seen 'em come up and fuck up the owner
Seen 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga I'm hot as Phoenix Arizona
I'm Utah, I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'mma Captain, you're a Lieutenant
[Hook: Ice Cube]
I can say what I want to say, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nigga, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
I can act like an animal, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
If I eat you like a cannibal, ain't nuttin to it
Gangsta rap made me do it
[Scarface]
Nah nigga blame me, for severing cocaine to the geeks
Gangbanging the streets, shooting guns where you sleep
Putting niggas in sheets, the noose hung from the tree
The corrupted police, I ain't denying it was me
I'm the reason for the setback in blacks
It's a natural fact, that gangsta rap did that
I hope that Barack could pull the troops for Iraq
Cause the truth is Iran, got them nuclear plants
I can shoot me a cat in the head with a gat
For a man that considers me a nigger when I'm back in the slums
Waiting for a check like a bum
Look how I did them niggas often numb
Hard, I got the strolls full of hoes
Liquor stores off the road
Big church on the corner with a spot for my rose
A Glock for my foes, wiping snot from my nose
I'm guilty of it all, but I am not 'fenna fold
[Hook: Ice Cube]
[Nas]
Uh, if they call you a nigger, ain't nuttin to it
Tell 'em Nas made you do it
Felonious, Thelonious Monk melodic
; 
Monster Cody OG
Hard as Rampart's police, warring like the ends was in Sunni
I never pull my pants up
, 
sagging my Gucci's, and what?
I give a fuck who you bidded with, or where you cop coke
The bitch you with or the reason you're not broke
I don't count your money, don't want none of your smoke
I don't feel your pain, I ain't none of your folk
It's easy to put a gun in your throat
But I ain't on that, trying to sip Colada's where it's warm at
Cognac, crushed ice, y'all know how it is
Elijah said - A women half your age plus seven years
It's a plush way to live, this is for the blunted
For the niggas who keep it one hundred
Who're hunted by DA's and Judges
[Hook + Interlude: Ice Cube]
[Outro: Ice Cube]
Oh yeah and another thing
For all ya niggas that don't do gangsta rap
Don't get on TV talking about gangsta rap
Cause nine times at a ten you don't know the fuck you're talk about
Talk about that bullshit rap you do
Stay the fuck out of mines

[Hook x2]
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only a few can feel my pain
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if I could show you
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) Only if you was in this game
(I'm cryin gangsta tears) You'd feel the whirlwind blow you
[Verse 1]
My daily dose is ferocious
I smoke dope, 
just as strong as opium
Hopin I'm close to just breakin frustration;
Speakin on podiums
Facin this cold world head-on, dead on arrivals
Young black, poor education guns crack
The gang violence done that
Nighttime, the guns blow, streets got snitches
Dealers, bitches,
 killers and blunt smoke, clubs open
Benzes, Jeeps, dubs pokin out tires
Thugs with heat,
 pay security, to let them slide in
Huh, I'm at the corner driftin, sippin, Cognac
To' back, know dat soldiers is packin no secret
Though I'm broken hearted women done left me hopeless in darkness
Smokin, driftin in sickness, stand by oceans watch the sun glisten
I'm soul-searchin, I'm soul-hurtin
What happens when money don't make you happy
I wish this on no person
Ate at the classy places, made all my fashion statements
I got no friends I'm lonely, don't want no pity save it
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Yo, ride in the nighttime, I'm high, got on my flight suit
Hood with the Nike sign, dark colors on
Pull up the block my brother's on
I hug him and we blow trees (sup nigga?) Scopin for police
Guns on our hip
, fiends want a fix, stumblin tricks (right here)
We left the drug game alone
Brothers is jealous cause we still call the hood our home
What could you tell us?
At funerals my eyes swell up (damn)
Look at my dog lay in the casket
Twin shotgun barrels had blasted
And rest in peace Barkin, is all I could whisper
As I paid respect, kissed his face and felt hard skin
It's part of God's plan, but why so many niggas have to die?
It's crowded in this place, let the priest and pastor by
Bandana covers my eye, I'm scopin through the room
I see killers and thieves, mob bosses and goons
And yet I feel responsible when my nigga's pronounced dead
Inside the hospital, I wish there's somethin I could do, but..
[Hook]

Stay set, sequel in the making
Three sixty my beliefs in the Nation
D's frisk me, they peep reparations
With a real nigga aura, though I speak education
So explicit, mix it with quantum physics
Gifted with Don lynguistics, sit and palm bitches
Palm biscuits, a youngin' was autistic
(?) Fly since the Garland District
Eccentric, inflictin' with the proper diction
Compositions consist of no competition
Christened by my folks out in park slope
Cigar smoke, stay awoke through Allah quotes
Cope with the crimes and the petty minds
Steady grind, let him rhyme, bet he shine
Bezzie time, VVS it because he's naked
Expose the despot, can't respect it when he dyslexic
Epic, keep the soldiers and the suckers separate
Perfected, don't speak on women that I slept with
Check it, been ordained since my first chain
And my attribute substituted my birth name
Words exchanged frequencies the (?)
Some would prefer fame, others lead and guide
Decide, confessions of the lost lessons
And my possessions keep a stressing nigga guessing
Question (?)
Hi haters, I'm back off of hiatus

[Produced by Salaam Remi]
[Hook x4: James Brown sample]
Get down, get down! Get down, get down!
[Verse 1: Nas]
New York streets where killers will walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin'
Pushin' cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died
, 
one guy, one time
One day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon
I turned while he asked me
What you up to the cops gon' bust you
I was a teen drunk off brew
Stumbled I wondered
If God sent him cause two squad cars entered the block
And looked at us
I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Staring at a young disciple
I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwing them bones
Hoping my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoeing
While he looking at centerfolds of pretty girls
Showing they little cooch
Gangstas don't die he's living proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin'
A white dude, killed his mother during the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is being replaced
Pre-trial hearing is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for Black Power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin'
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out
Nobody leaving, everybody
[
Hook x4

[Verse 2: Nas]
Some niggas fuck their enemies in they ass when they catch em
Weird-ass niggas are dangerous, so don't test em
They make you, disappear
, 
this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggas, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin'
They had the coke game something crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amaze me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or something
Took a puff, what the fuck, I turned to punch him
Southern niggas ain't slow
, 
nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we lounging, out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dog from Pelican Bay
The letter say, Nas I got your back the fools don't play
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thugging and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'm a mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
Should have never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Opening the hotel room door to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had something to do with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin told him I ain't fucking with you
He responded cool but told me out here this how motherfuckers
[
Hook x4
]
[Salaam Remi]
All I really gotta say is that
If that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down
A shame when you really look at it
My folk against your folk but we all kinfolk
Somebody got to make a change

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Niggas know and if they don't
I shoot 'em in the head, whatever rock his fucking boat
Niggas in my face, you better leave before you can't
I lick shots like stamps, no FedEx
I'm hot check the critics, call the paramedics
Your man was talking reckless so you know he had to get it
Me and money's magnetic, and you the polar opposite
Come through, bitch start dropping it, getting low
I don't gotta trick, the only magic I know
Wore the number 32 and retired some time ago
So check the liner notes and miss me with the bullshit
Miss me with it or get hit with a full clip
I'm back on it, you can bet your ass on it
I'm so sure that I could put my fucking last on it
And if I didn't sell then you know I rapped on it
Beat so ugly, gotta put a fucking mask on it
[Hook: Prodigy]
We get it forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never
We get it forever
We do this forever
It's on forever
Calm down, never
Slow it down, never
[Verse 2: Prodigy]
Looking through my eyes' view I see nothing but
Success for us, non-stop nothing but
Long money, long jab I stretch
Wrap around the Earth, 80 times 10
Warm breezes and Barbado nights
Living sweet, yeah, but it's a cold life
You know we strapped in,
 
best you buckle up
I did my little bid in years yea, what's up, what's up
Dare a nigga trouble us, make my niggas risk all of this
Infamous good shit, so quick
I'll be back inside the cage, my rage is unchanged
For this change, yea this bank, for I have is worth the pain
Change and pinky rings, estates for the kings
A Queens-bred gentlemen, she know how we bang
You tamper with this plush lifestyle, may you lay
In a hole 'til you ferment, your bones decay
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
We come from where murders occur often on late nights
Niggas is high and they eyes be red as two brakelights
Medical marijuana, Henny bottles, and Grey Goose
Semis and shottys on deck,
 
everybody's face screwed
But you know this already, my hood the coldest and deadly
Soldiers is ready, I am boastful, forgive me
Bitches talking and cops cry when they nigga get washed
Beef could've been squashed, go finish that shit that you start
No clip in your Glock, you ain't prepared to fire
We call that riding with no air in your tire
You're flattened, it's a pattern after scrapping
What usually happen, death on arrival
Survival of the fittest,
 ain't nothing like that Queensbridge shit
Y'all niggas finished, your only chances are diminished
And we don't need no fucking witness
Ain't what you know, it's what you live and we live it
[Hook]

[Nas Yelling]
Picture us married, you and me what?
(Crowd) K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl you and me (you and me repeat)
[Verse 1: Nas]
This ain't no sucka for love shit
This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hug shit
First night we fuck shit and don't call the next day
This a thug's wedding day, in love
Will we make it? Let us pray
In the limo my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard bottles, mob costumes this ain't no act though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenumptial agreement
Cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping, but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves cinderella's ball and the whole shit
But know this
You fuckin' wit' a slit your throat quick
Vehicular explosion, cigar smokin', dark minded, chart climbin
Well spokin say farewell to broke men or rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it hun
Headed to the chapel, my niggas laughin, and its baffling
Cuz just a year ago, it's weird though, I knew I'd get married
To who I knew not
Thought of snatchin Halle up from the dredlock
Pumpin Sade, my head nod
Finally I met the perfect bitch, pardon my French
Rephrase that, someone who make my heart stop
Couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey, HIV spreadin'
Everybody bump the same bunnies
The game, will put niggas in they grave
Right before they part ways, with the street
I want a son to greet, every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin, tellin me it's time to eat
I'm getting married
[Hook: Nas] (3X)
Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigalo
It was difficult for me to find the chick I want
[Verse 2: Nas]
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on and ride
Even Martin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative one's say
Knew my wedding would be one day, but quickly its this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at ol' photos, sayin' damn he used to twist me
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, nudged me wit' his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to city hall, dressed norm
Said she would love me in my Ozwald Boateng
Customized in London by guys who suitup kings
Girl, you get the rings young, you behave
Maxwell he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky, Mississippi
Family packed in, My nigga L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cuflings, ginger ale got it out
Walked in the church, chest all big to thug it out
My girl walked in, glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance' to Mrs. Jones
That's a union that nobody could touch
I gotta be cool, wit ur crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much, cuz you put up wit' my shit
Court cases, baby mamas
I make a honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter standin
Heart poundin out my chest like a canon
I'm happy, One of my groomsmen, under the music, says don't do it
But they just jokes, some crew shit, they playin', I'm gleeful
I'm stayin I'm sayin vowels all true
Will you take music as your wedded wife? I DO
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin to
I'm getting married
[Hook]
I'm getting married

*Samples Nas' "You're Da Man"
Ayo Joe here's another one
Tim & Bob, Nas
[Nas]
They drool on blue jewels on the arm
Too cool when I'm calm
Still moved to the psalm
Been a minute since I heard some new Joe
Cause dawg is crazy R&B cujo
And I'mma - rap psycho, Norm and Bates call it mama
With the brown in Llama
But I ain't in town for no drama
Just peeping shorty, peep me so I own her
[Joe]
In the club deep with all my crew
Saturday nights is just what we do
Just enjoying the good life, it's alright in here
When I turned around I see a sexy mami staring at me
I already know what she's thinking, she wants me tonight
Yeah!
(Chorus: Joe)
I see you looking at naughty
Come over and get to know me
Tell me what it is you're sipping
Just live it up, I got the bar
Maybe if you get to know me
Then maybe we can leave this party
Ohh you got a sexy body
Come over and get to know me
[Joe]
You're so damn hot girl you making me sweat
You got a round thing that I can't forget
From your hips all the way to your chest
Look so good
, I'mma say that I'm impressed
You should thank God cause you've been blessed
Come here so I can get into your head
Don't be shy
Come over, come over
Come over, come over
Come over, come over and get to know me
(Chorus: Joe) X2
[Nas]
Yeah baby I know why you're here
I know what you're thinking but I ain't saying nothing
Great minds think a like you're an intelligent species
We've already connect through telekinesis
Plus my gear's correct, the monkey jeans on
One pair 15 huh, crisp clean Air Ones
I think you can be my sparkle
Maybe my Claudine raising my offspring
The haze is lit, you taste the algae
The grapes I sip from Napa Valley
Your waist is slim it must be balley's
You're killing me softly like old school Albee
(Chorus: Joe) X2
[Joe]
Come over and get to know me
We're gonna like what you see
Ooh, aah, ooh yeah
Come over here girl, come over here
Come over here baby, come over here

Ghetto niggas' dreams
From the hood
[Verse 1: Common]
I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy, but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake,
 
her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car cause we just can't wait
To get home, early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low,
 
money by her Bible
The type of bitch that BIG said he would die for
Is the type that I ride to stay alive for
Tats on her back, looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together, she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting: we getting it on
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Common]
I don't even say shit, she can feel it
Eye talk's the realest, toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm, the other is a skillet
Fried chicken, macaroni, raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince, she's my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony, Montana
Reminded me a me of my, of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares, not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money, power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed
When the cameras start snapping, she's ready to pose
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me, getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes, congresswomen inflictin'
Pain onto my game, wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it, they dyked it, devices twisted
'til I get a nice chick, to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids, Labrador behind the white fence
But I'm still single,
 
looking for Cleopatra
African Queen
, yo look at me, I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble, keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers, be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour, bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette, my manors
Half hood half class, photographers' cameras
Caught us out there, the spotlight, hope she can handle this
She can join me, red carpet at my next non-profit
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley
 with 
some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects
[Hook]

[Intro]
Uhh.. regulate nigga
Bravehearts nigga
Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours nigga
Get yours baby
Uhh, yo.. yo..
[Verse 1]
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
With big dreams, like
 
Castro, overthrew Bautista
From Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
But hold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's
With blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin, from past to present times
, 
heaven shines
Light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..
[Verse 2]
Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men
 - 
not takin charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit
 - 
it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
Find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily
 - 
I was put on one of the ships that made it
Through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
To sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
Who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
May we break away from the chains abroad
[Hook]
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..
[Verse 3]
You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies
; 
the truth is
Time waits for none of you
, 
in fact
He can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
Lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin for nuttin but takin
Headed for nuttin but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin
Judges is not relatin to pleas
, 
guns bustin where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
In bystanders, get cancelled
, 
D.O.A
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past
And a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin harder than the generations here before he came
Goin through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..
[Hook]

[Verse 1 - Rich Boy]
Let me take you through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, busting them 
K's
Heavy guns and dope funds and raids by the police
Still getting pulled over and asked by the police
'Bama
 wasn't made for a nigga to win
See the color of your skin get you put in the pen
It's real life, over dice, Dwayne dead and gone
Sending niggas to the pen or the funeral home
I be feeling like the Lord will never answer me back
So I'm holding on my gat just in case they attack
Bullet holes in your house will make it hard to sleep
You see the fiends on the street want the hard for cheap
A lot of niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
Niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitenti
ary bars'l
l break men
[Hook - John Legend]
It's where you live, it's where you play
It's where you learn your favorite slang
Your world is ghetto
It's where I live; it's where I'm from
It's where you had to tote your gun
Your world is ghetto
[Verse 2 - Lil Wayne]
I could never win an Oscar cause I don't know how to act
Saw my first million dollars and I ain't know how to act
Then the second million came, then more came after that
Then more came after that, 
hurricane after that
Damn! And y'all saw the aftermath
And in my hood we don't front, so I do give back
When you see a hood nigga you gotta tilt your hat
And since I'm a hood nigga, I do just that
OGs used to tell me: "You just rap
Lil' nigga all you need to do is rap"
And just when I thought I was gon' do just that
Poppa was a Rolling Stone and them stones was crack
Fuck being like Mike
 
I wanna be like pop
Then I picked up a mic 
I wanna be like 'Pac
Please put down the pipe you don't need that rock
Please put up a fight for the kids that watch
Us in the spotlight and then they mock
But caskets get closed and then they drop
And cases get closed and they are dropped
'
Cause no one knows and nobody got
Any out no N-O, that they better not
Three words to a witness: they get shot
Let me tell you what this is, this is the block
Always talk to God, never listen to cops
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Nas]
It's cool to love to win but it's better to hate to lose
There's only one Nas 'bout a hundred thousand yous
You lose money chasing women, never lose women chasing money
Niggas is broke plus the wolves is hungry
Morgues full of dead niggas 
who was taking money
Morgues full of niggas with the last shit they ate in stomach
Spinach and steak
. 
GORE-TEX boot prints
 
still on his face
It's still on his face when we visit his wake
Whatever's undone I'd do it, fight against a whole army
One gun I'll use it, some Sun Tzu shit
Creeping on ya like walking pneumonia
You're far from opponents; we could spar for the moments
I stay in deceitful conversations with creeps with foul natures
Attempted murders trials, the basics
Threatening the witnesses and relatives of dead victims
It's the shit we live, uh
Queensbridge
 thug matrimony, clap a phony
Bullets even hit a cracker in his Abercrombie
Psychoanalyst was asking me what happened to me?
See the yak got to me, then the gat got to me
Then the homies on the block with the stacks of money
Then these beautiful bitches was bending backwards for me
Then lames put the rap game in a casket slowly
Man I don't give a fuck, this is rap to me

[Rich Boy]
Let me take ya through my hood where I was born and raised
Where niggas tote semi-automatics, busting them K's
Heavy guns and dope boys harassed by the police
Still getting pulled over and asked by the police

Niggas doing life from undercovers and fake friends
It's real how them penitentiary bars'll break men
(chorus) John Legend
It's where ya live, it's where ya play
It's where ya learn, ya favorite slang
Your world is, ghetto

[INTRO: ALL]
1,2, Eye for an eye we in this together
Son your beef is mine So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together son your beef is mines
[Verse 1: Raekwon]
Ayo,ayo,ayo, my thug related style attract millions
Fans, they understand my plan
Who's the kid up in the green Land?
Then I skate motivate gettin' (Sniff)
Lifted, me and my chick get eight
Now im coolin' with the clique Mobb Deep and
Nas,
 word up here's the first prize I generate
Off the head piece, freestyle session word up son
[Verse 2: Nas]
Check it out yo,To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, monkey do shorty sipping sunny dew
On a low like a ????? o,chill shades of flow
Big Havoc at like you know, kid
[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Kid, you don't know me, you don't wanna know me
You tried to blow me your weak side just showed me
Stepped out my door on 41st Side at 12
,
Didn't see my crew around so I got bent for search
I had to jet back upstairs so I can stash my 9
It was a Friday night Rikers had it bad one time
Cause niggas getting bagged on a regular son
D's like "Fuck the drugs, all we want is the guns,"
So I proceed with caution, eyes open whenever walking
Niggas be ass talking then be victims of extortion
Hold myself down the only way I know
Niggas pumping back in streets, in debt cause they owe
Street life is like a trial, ass out if you blow
The maximum is death son you know how that go

[Nas]
Got out the airport, the Mobb picked me up in the truck
Jewelry chunky like fuck, I ain't scared to get stuck
So what's the deal 
Papi
, you heard the feds almost got me
I had the Cuban posse all up in my room and lobby
Negotiating like Illuminati, network
With catch a body experts
, in retrospect to the foul connect
When I lost, but back then was my fault
Now it's time to floss
, 
eye for a eye what's mine is yours
I need a suite with the flowers complimentary at Trump Towers
Sit at the table we can build for hours
On getting rich, it's a cinch, take a glimpse
"The World Is Yours" written all over the blimps
Here's a toast to my foes, it's like a whole new beginning
With Quaaludes and cream and loads of women rocking linen
I got a plan to blow to Hiroshima, Japan
Moving niggas out the hood and just divide it with fam
Ay yo the bitches, like Gee Money said to his man
'll ride the dick like a horse with the cowboy brand
[Hook]
Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, nigga rep your clique
[Havoc]
Yo son, I'm feeling it
Opposition want me dead, concealing shit
From gats got me living,
 kid, rushing through my pyramid
You secondary, go against the grain then you adversary
Had to bury niggas on my side that snitch
Ran his mouth like a bitch, now he's laying in the ditch
That he dug for himself, on his grave I had to piss
Scud missile, never miss you, hit you
Scratch you off my list, Gemstar rip through
Your mental, deeper, you ain't having it, me neither
It's drama, ain't got time for no breathers
Rapper Noyd make these niggas into believers
(Yo Noyd, what up with this cat right here, man? Word up)
[Big Noyd]
The tough guy screwing me? I guess he got plans to ruin me
He wanted to do me, slowly but surely I peeked his fast ass a bit early
Grabbed him by his wig, his shit was curly
(Put the chrome to his dome) let him know it's never early
You can slide, before I snatch the heat from his side
Saw the devil in despise by the look in his eyes
He was surprised how I snatched him up, regulated his gat
And backed him up, stepped to the side, P blast him up
[Prodigy]
Yeah yo, cannons erupt, you got strucked up abstrusely
Some rapper nigga playing thug tried to approach me
(Yo, kill that nigga
Man!)
All I remember was I shot for his throat
G
You see big guns in 3-D, it's haunting
It gets deep, fucking with these Chinese
Thai weed burning my hip from 
hot gats
Burning my lips from roach clips
Catch me on the 40th and Bootlegger, in the AM
These ante meridiem cats, insomniacs
Four in the morning we throwing back some Cognac juice
Letting gats loose, the blue van blitz through
These pissed two couldn't find the pistol
Ay yo, hopped out the Lexus, holding my necklace
I'm bent off some next shit, gasoline with a kerosene twist
Stumbling, placing my gun right, it's slipped down its calibre
Looking for chicks that he can stab now
Numbed up from my fiery cup of hell juice
Some singed nectar, Satan's fountain of youth
Mega action, 
bitches all around ready to fuck
Big asses, you raw-dogging shit, pressing your luck
My pipe game's like a night train, top speed through your womb-piece
Rated X to say the least
[Hook]
Give up the pussy fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the 'tel if it ain't a freak show
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique
Give it up fast, quick and not slow
Not going to the tables if it's not about dough
Son you know, Mobb Deep is running this shit
QBC, niggas rep they clique

[Nas]
Uhh..
Uh.. speak without thinkin..
Speak without speakin.. huh..
Feel without reachin, uhh
That's what it's about
It's about that, inner, inner love, yaknawmean?
Chorus: Nas
God love us hood niggas (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas (I know)
And the killers, God love us good niggas (I know)
Cause on the streets is the hood niggas, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
Cause he be wit us in the prisons
And he takes time to listen
, uhh
God love us hood niggas (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggas, uhh
But he forgive us
[Nas]
He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
And those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
By the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
When I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
But the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggas
Chorus
[Nas]
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring em back today
So long my crimies now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
They takin him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin clips up, countin bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him,
 
saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin me
Chorus
[Nas]
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke 
trees
 in the hood
Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, 
coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood
, parolees
Ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll fuck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood
I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and 
duck strays
 in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh) in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on top of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most

It ain't nothin' but a paper chase
But even when ya paper straight
Every stage just another way to see cake
But niggas still gotta die hate
Well fuck it, I'mma do it cause the streets put me to it
See y'all niggas is late
See it's big face, big livin'
Big dogs and big pimpin'
Game played with nothin' but precision
Money, cars, and women
See niggas hatin' cause they on the outside
Wishin' they could find a way in it
You see the rims spinnin' all black tinted
With the niggas who'll bring it to ya brain
If it's fuckin' with change
Fifty-four nigga remember the name
Ritz, glitz only when we empty clips
And dismember your brain
Cause I remember pain, gain pain, this winner reign
But now it's high tech out here in the center lane
See we got the world respectin' the slang
The good life, hit the studio, the club, straight to the plane
[Hook]
[Nas]
Yo, yo, yo
Pass you cowards, classical rap mix form power
Yasser Arafat,

And I'm murderous,

I'm goin' for the top regardless
Pretty Boy Floyd, 
the rotten tooth king
Ghosts of my dead friends linger
I toast to you lover, blunts lit, wish I was hittin'
Cock back, four pound, let six in the air
Rock that raw sound, gettin' wet to this year
Cause of the projects Hannibal Lec,
 
hand on my tec
In front the White House, my ice out demandin' respect
Braveheartin' to the grave darlin' wavin' my sterling
From out the black Bentley it's off, spray till y'all fallin'
East to West Coast ballin'
Nate Dogg, Nas, and Kurupt, liven it up, dimes in the cut
Sizin' us up, y'all wanna fuck, gin and tonic my cup
And we live the good life, 
still chronic it up

[Intro: Nas & (Ron Isley)]
Good Morning, Yea (Yea, well, well Yea)
[Verse 1: Nas]
Good morning the same old jerks goin' to work
Garbage man pick up the dirt, the birds don't chirp
There's this nice Lady I know, she always speak
Wit her two children, headed to the school buildin
Then rush home and again to lit housin'
And they are puttin' out the new ceilings
Cuz her shit is leakin'
Water keep drippin'down, so she beefin'
Husband keep cheatin', he've been out all-evenin'
Good morning, police shifts the hood is on-in'
So they drive around all-day wit bench warrants
Eatin donuts and sippin' on coffee
Ooops!, sudden stop, it spills on the walkie-talkie
"Damn this nigger is a creep"
Whispers the police at the Wino in the middle of the street
Wit missin' front teeth twist blunts deep in the cut
It's my nigga so I holler it up, niggas good morning
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Good morning cause I'm still here
Didn't get a wake-up call from out there
So I'm head back to the street for my lesson
And only live by God's blessings
[Verse 2: Nas]
Good morning, yawnin, dawn is no gon'in'
New day, toothpaste brushin my screwface
Follow the light, it's just a great feelin'
And I love life, every minute is pure healin'
Can't you tell I'm much happy nowadays
No more child play, livin' life the foul way
My man just came home speedin
Tryin' to catch up wit 9-years of no freedom
The paper say - "They finally caught 'em"
He back in, I guess street life got too borin'
Kind of quiet, half the hood is still sleep
If you saw the night before you won't believe it's the same street
Put on my lenses, leave the Phantom
Take the low-whip for a trip up to
 
Pan Pan's
Scramblin' white turkey cacon
"Ma pass the hot sauce from out your apron"
[Hook]

[Produced by Megahertz]
[Intro - Sample]
Woke up this mornin'
You got yourself a gun
You got yourself a gun
[Hook]
Yo, I'm living in this time behind enemy lines
So I got mine, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You from the hood, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
You want beef, I hope you (got yourself a gun)
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
So you tried to front, hope you (got yourself a gun)
You ain't real, hope you (got yourself a gun)
[Verse 1]
My first album had no famous guest appearances
The outcome: I'm crowned the best lyricist
Many years on this professional level
Why would you question who's better,
 
the world is still mine
Tattoo's real, with "God's Son" across the belly
The boss of rap, you saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
To take it back to Africa,
 
I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames a huddle,
 
your teams shook y'all feel
The wrath of a killer, cause this is my football field
Throwing passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
But the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback
Every word is like a sawed-off blast
 
cause y'all all soft
And I'm the black hearse that came to haul y'all ass in
It's for the hood by the corner store
Many try, many die
Come at Nas if you want a war, get it bloody
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
And If I wasn't,
 
I must've been Escobar
You know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
 
hair parted with a
Barber's preciseness,
 
Bravehearted
 for life, it's
The return of the Golden Child
, 
son of a blues player
So who are you, player? Y'all awaited the true savior
Puffing that tropical. Cups of that vodka, too
Papi chu'
, 
tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? never
, 
'member I do this through righteous steps
You Judas
 
thought I was gone, so in light of my death
Y'all been all happy-go-lucky, bunch of sambos
Call me "God's Son"
 
with my pants low
I don't die slow,
 
put them rags up like Petey Pablo
This is Nasdaq though, in my Nascar
With this Nas flow, what could beat that?
 
Not a soul repping
Hit the record store, never let me go, get my whole collection
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
It's the return of the prince, the boss
This is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit soft
Sip Cris, get chips, wrist gloss I floss
Stick-shift look sick up in that Boxster Porsche
With the top cut off,
 
rich kids go and cop The Source
They don't know about the blocks I'm on
And everybody wanna know where the kid go
Where he rest at, where he shop at and dress at
Know he got dough, where does he live?
Is he still in the Bridge?
Does he really know how ill that he is?
Got all of y'all watching my moves, my watch and my jewels
Hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I?
The back twister, lingerie ripper
Automatic leg-spreader, quicker brain-getter
Keeping it gangsta with ya'
[Hook]

[Intro: Lil Jon talking]
"Yeeeeah! (Yeeeeah!) It's been a long journey getting' to
This motherfuckin' point of this Crunk Juice shit. (What?!)
But we done got to the last motherfuckin' song niggas
(Last shit niggas!)
 
And I got five of the hottest motherfuckin'
Emcees in the world, givin' you that gangsta shit!
IT'S THE MOTHERFUCKIN' GRAND FINALE!!!!!!"
[Verse 1: Bun B]
We growin' doja in the basement in that underwater garden
 (Okay)
When hereon in the back shed, dry it 'til it harden
Make it hash up in the oven (Man), put yayo in the hot plate
Drain and dry in the freezer, it's obvious we got weight
I said hard work, that's soft work even with wet work
Built-in clientele so we ain't gotta network (Let's go)
We always got work, so we ain't gotta get work
And if you ain't gettin' your work from us you bound to get jerked
We yayo experts, we been whippin' the yola since the crackas decided to
Take the coke from Coca-Cola
Hold the rollers, 
the king of the Trill
The underground as well
, 
you can step in the ring when you feel
Nigga just sound the bell
Can't sound the heaters in this game, but the grind I'm lovin'
Nigga we passed all that pushin', man it's time for shovin'
I got the mask, I got the strap, soon as I find the gloves
We gonna start exposin' off like Farhrenheit 9/11
[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
I'mma speak clearly cause I don't think they hearin' me
A nigga only fear's gettin' charged with conspiracy
I'ca get it right to ya, sticky green white to ya
Wear whatever you want, bullets goin' right through ya
If you stressin' to get buried
My niggas'll send you back to the essence in a hurry
Sippin' Crunk Juice, blowin' Dutchies in the Chevy
Try to figure me out dawg, I'm light but I'm heavy
Yellow lemonheads in the bezzie of the presi'
And yeah, anybody'ca rock but D-Block rock steady (D-Block!)
FED's don't need no warrants cause y'all all informants
So I get higher than New York insurance
Try to keep shit clean like Florence
Moved on up on the East side cause I never lost endurance
And it's all real niggas, if I ever get a license to carry
Shit, that's a license to kill niggas
[Verse 3: T.I.]
I refuse to lose, I rather give these weak dudes the blues
And separate them from they jewels, teach 'em don'ts and do's
I raise tools, make crews make decisions confused
All spectators can say is, "This lil' nigga's a fool"
A short fuse with some loose screws, some unscrewed
Better prove, you niggas pussy as the Moulan Rouge
So who guardin' who, 
you know who to you know what
To you know where
, 
goin' 'gainst 'em's too unfair
Cause everywhere you do a show he got kinfolk there
Now you know I ain't no ?, I got ten folk there
They ain't powerful as the one at the end of your prayer
Got you runnin' for your life without a minute to spare
Catch you dead to the granite, melt the grease in your hair
When I go, them boys is gonna be indecent affair
Guarantee you nah a real nigga breathin' accounted
At your funeral, just your parents and the preacher was there
Hollow, television name-dropper reachin' for help
So I ain't gotta say a word, pimp you beatin' ya'self
You gon' get what you deserve for disrespectin' the game
Any nigga with the nerve to say another man name
When that other man ain't even present
And deny it when somebody ask him about it
That nigga's a lame
, you like to lie on the mic
Hide behind fame, I was a G when I came
That's the way I remain
[Verse 4: Nas]
Who besides the Egyptian-walker
, fuckers have a conniption
My existence persistent to bring foes misfortune
I dazzle 'em, 
like the alderman, Billy Dee in Mahogany
, minus the perm
From the tiniest sperm that the mightiest The Almighty can muster
Project prophet
, 
chronic blockage gives Alzheimer's to youngsters
Amongst them is me, can't remembers my beefs
With who? For what? They screw-face me up, my boo laced me up
Balenciaga
, 
flimsy condo with bimbos in south of Key Largo in pimp mode
The inf' glow on his clothes and you know it's over
Hammer hit pin, pin hit shell, from the shell the slug gonna chew ya
Try not to lose me, I try not to lose'ya
Mamma say mamma sa mu makasa
, fly to Cuba
To chill with some politi-kill niggas who ill
Cause y'all niggas are losers, don't get comfortable nigga
Say hello to Mr. Bad Guy, get that cash par, I'm the last don
You'll ever know so, here you go y'all can take these thoughts
Anyway I'm chargin' emcees a late fee cost
So when y'all done with my style, please break me off
But never make Nas mad just in case cross
Cause ah, lately y'all don't make me happy
To calm my nerve I need the herb GNC don't carry
[Verse 5: Ice Cube]
Who the fuck is that? It's Ice Cube motherfucka
He's a maniac, no I'mma fool motherfucka
Old school motherfucka, blow through a motherfucka
What you heard about a nigga so true motherfucka
See I'm ugly and prettay, I'm polished and grittay
Shoot better than that nigga that tried to kill 50
See, niggas get shittay when I come to their cittay
When I hit the spot that bitch they like -- she cummin' with me
Cause I got an ego big as TO, but I'm not an Eagle
Bitch, I roll a Regal cause
 
gangstas don't dance we boogie
I told you motherfuckas Kobe didn't take that pussy
Get money, get paid, you can beat that shit
Even if the DA is a piece'a shit
Colorado got bravado, but eat that shit
Another White bitch lyin' on the Black dick
I keep it flippin' like flapjacks, pimpin' like black 'Lacs
Give niggas flashbacks, they sweaty as ass cracks
When I hit the tarmac, it feel like a carjack
Niggas get out and vanish like Star Treks
So fuckin incredible, I'm so fuckin' credible
No matter what happen, I'll never turn federal
And that's my report comin' straight from Cali
Ice Cube is the shit on this motherfuckin' Grand Finale

[Intro: Nas]
...Word-up A
I had the joint out
Nigga gon' ask me "what [I] want?"
Know what I'm sayin'?
I'm like
Gimme, just gimme, for the NYC
Gimme what you can't get back
Gimme, why don't you gimme the world
Gimme what you can't get back
, 
for the five boroughs
[Verse 1: AZ]
Yo, it's hard to show resistance when money getting niggas
Need my assistance to stack figures, beyond non-existence
Fuck keepin my distance, cos bein poor produced persistence
Plus plea's, a hundred G's, I had me blockin out of jail sentence
I'm recognized by the illest of individuals
Killers and criminals, even willies that's really into jewels
But still skeptic on who I cling to
Cos every single nigga that swing through ain't my man just cos we mingle
Too much snake shit, even females be feedin off that fake shit
Filled with envy and hatred but my high helps me escape it
Temporarily, though it don't worry me
The wise verbally nourish me
, properly with that inner city, 
urban GC
I fuck with those beyond my age bracket
Cos they analyze and map it, get the papers and stack it
Leavin no trace to track it, kingpin thinkin tactics is accurate
That mack shit, livin the lifestyle, we feel relaxed with
[Hook: Nas] + (AZ)
Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme 
(Rollin trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back 
(True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme 
(Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back, for the five burroughs
[Verse 2: AZ]
So in God I trust, I lust for a 850-deluxe
And until I touch a million-plus, ain't much to discuss
Diamonds and double-digits, Gianni Versace down with lizards
It's realism so I visualize it to live it
Movin cleverly, with intentions of longevity
Strong pedigree got me touchin papers, others would never see, G
So do the crest in my claw, flourescents
Symbolises the essence, 
you're sailin in a sweppervescence
Drug investments, a street thug's plug, the insurance, but informers
They had you wanted for warrants 'fore you get enourmous
Life's a performance so players play with endurance
Cos for more cents, any villain's willing to get more intense
They tried to break us but all it did was just make us
Travel across acres for papers, bonafide money takers
Cause though we know somehow we all gotta go
As long as we're leaving thieving, we'll be leaving with some kind of dough
So...
[Hook: Nas] + (AZ)
Just gimme (Pimp lines and dollar signs)
Just gimme 
(Rollin trees, stackin G's)
Gimme what you can't get back 
(True dat, I thought you knew that)
Just gimme 
(Money getters, the high bidders)
Why don't you gimme the world (rollin wit us)
Gimme what you can't get back (It's real, NYC)
Just gimme (
QB
)
Just gimme (
B-K
, VT)
Gimme what you can't get back (See me, AZ y'all, representin)
Just gimme (Yeah, the street life is trife life)
Why don't you gimme the world (Representin)
Gimme what you can't get back 
(Life's a bitch and then you die)

[DMX - dialogue]
I ain't goin back to jail
Next time, the County or the State see me
It's gonna be in a bag
UHH! This is it baby!
End of the road, ha hah!
When you a dawg, you a dawg for life!
You don't hear me though, you don't hear me though
You don't hear me though, c'mon, c'mon!
[Method Man]
Watch them young guns that take none, nobody safe
From the Friday the 13th, ghetto Jason
Itchy trigger finger achin, 
snatch yo' ass
Out that S-Class for fakin
, forty-fo' blast
Is a bloodbath, take your first step down a thug path
Ain't no love here, just slugs here
Kids know the half you get plugged here, that's just impossible
For the weak to last now behold the unstoppable
Third eye watchin you, watchin me
Throwin rocks from the penalty box, cop a plea
Young G we was born to die, don't cry for me
Just keep the heat closely and ride for me
Cause we family for better or worse, you and I
From the dirt, you snatch purse, so hard it hurt
To be here, 
and each year, I'm pourin out more beer
For deceased peers, holdin fort
Police line 'Do Not Cross', they found his corpse
In the loft with the head cut off, and butt naked
Homicide the crime Method, add another
Killer verse to the murder record, the Grand Finale
[Lennox speaking - movie dialogue]
Who wan' test me, c'mon!
Me shot pussy-hole fi fun
[Nas Escobar]
Hot corners, cops with warrants, every block is boring
Friday night, getting bent, 
liquor pourin'
My dawg, not even home a month yet, and blaze a girl
In the stomach, he robbin niggas who pumpin
Lil' Blood got popped, by the group home cat
Everybody nervous in the hood, pullin they gats
Fiend yellin out, who got those? Go and see
Shorty snot-nosed, he don't floss but he got dough
Thug faces, fugitives runnin from court cases
Slugs shootin past for the love of drug paper
Queens cap peelers, soldiers, drug dealers
And God'll throw a beam of lightning down cause he feel us
May the next one, strike me down if I'm not the realest
The Mayor wanna call the SWAT team to come and kill us
But, dawgs are friends, 
if one see the morgue, one'll live
To get revenge,
 and we ride to the end
Bravehearts 
blow the lye with Henn
, and still rise
Took alive with live men, 
my man got three six-to-eighteen's
And only five in, 
the Belly of the beast
Didn't wanna hear the shit I tried to tell him on the streets
It's irrelevant, the beast love to eat black meat
And got us niggas from the hood, hangin off his teeth
We slangin to eat
, bringin the heat
Bulletholes, razor scars is the pain in the street, huh
Chorus: Ja Rule (repeat 2X)
When you a dawg you a dawg for life (ride or die)
My dawgs feel pain from love (see eye to eye)
Give us one shot at life (let us fly)
Come on niggas! (we dawgs for life)
[DMX and Lakid {dialogue}]
There's mad money out here dawg
Mad money out here
What you tryin to get it? (Word up)
You gonna bust your gun to get it? (Tsh, whatever yo)
I hear you I hear you
[DMX]
Uhh, I've lost my grip on reality or so it would seem
Pinch myself to wake up, cause I KNOW it's a dream
Niggas that don't know me see me and think I'mma rob em
Niggas that know me well see me and think I'mma problem
I'm just a nigga that's misunderstood
But word to God I turn your last name to Underwood
Cause if I see it, I'mma take it and run with it, that's me
What type of bullshit is this nigga on? That's D
The dawg come and getcha outside
The more blood flows, when I plug holes with the snub nosed
Gun blows, bullets whistle, wouldn't miss you
Hit you all up in your mouth like it tried to kiss you
Drama, it's right here, how MUCH YOU NEED?
Beat you down with gat see how MUCH YOU BLEED
How MUCH YOU PLEAD, for your life, you was a killer
And all the bitches comin up out that ass you feelin, gettin realer
Now beg for your life, one more time, one more crime
One more nine, c'mon cry nigga
It's over! This is the shit, that hits hard
You either the last one standing, or the last one to fall

Ill Will
Ill Will's alive yea Killah Priest Nasdaq Dow Jones ha ha
(Hook)
Guns for gun streets filled with rivers of blood
Raised in the PJ's with real niggas and thugs
Eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth
Blood for blood coming to a theater near you
It's all love
Guns for gun streets filled with rivers of blood
Raised in the PJ's with real niggas and thugs
[Priest]
I'll make Mussolini wear a Kufi
I talk like Dr. Ben but look like Malcolm holding his Uzi
Peering through curtains who would I murder?
Pearl silencer screw on my burner four four caliber
The new Nat Turner I'll make Hitler wear a yarmulke
KKK celebrate Kwanzaa
Should I pursue further?
I'm like Tutankhamen with the tools in my garment
Put a few in my cartridge the moon and stars lit
Light up the hood it looks like a techno club
We slam dance to this music when the Tek blow slugs
It's ghetto thugs, welfare and poor education and gang love
Sitting in the Federal waiting
(Hook)
[Nas]
What did Malcolm think split second before he was shot?
Did he think to hit the deck on the floor before he dropped?
Or did he just say "Fuck it" I'm ah die for my brothers?
Cause by killing him just made his words teach others
Like Martin Luther King he preached peace
Like the West East beef finally that shit is rotten
Place yourself in the shoes of a people's leader
From drug kingpin to President either is off the meter
Your best man can turn it or squeeze ya burn you and leave ya
Beside a lonely road or inside a meat freezer
That's the way it goes on the 3rd rock from the sun (earth)
Alone circling the light were we begun where we become
A follower to a general with soldiers to run
They move off every word of your tongue
Fearless and ruthless when you was young pulling your gun
Not scared to shoot shit remember it was all in the fun
If it's power you wanted can you control over a hundred minds?
And these are grown men who've killed over a hundred times
Every champ team has an arch rival
And it takes one time to mess up and niggas don't like you
You start to want peace, niggas want you deceased
Your money low, niggas want you to go
Who else but I can bring the most haunting flow? (Nas)
You soon to see the best of me
From a boy man to a king hear out my destiny
(Hook)
[Priest]
When my fam is at stake
I think of how much slander I take
Then I sit back and watch tapes on Alexander the Great
I start studying how he bloodied men
I think of rappers I'm a massacre
Metal armor cover my skin
Take me to war, fuck y'all
Priest is Ivan the Terrible
Stare at my eyes, they're unbearable
You collide with the generals
Surround me like the most high
Surrounded by Cherubim
Who'd imagine the illest collabo
Priest and Nas are incredible
He's spits ether, I spit urancha
Describe how you devils move
Scream on MC's as I recline on my pedestal
(Hook)
[Nas]
The I to the L to the L to the W the I to the L to the L
To the W the I to the L to the L
To bring trouble to all ya niggas

[Intro]
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria
[Verse 1]
Before I blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front; matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catching the Jungle Fever
King poetic. Too much flavor,
 
I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r,
 
I'll pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm an ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head,
 
I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'mma performer strange, so the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime
[Hook]
It's halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
[Verse 2]
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes
, 
I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle; now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83 I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch "CHiPs", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format
Explore rap and tell me "Nas ain't all that"
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial, niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon - the real rap comes at halftime
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I got it going on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey: I hardly sparked it
Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, pass the Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay,
 
and hit a matinee
Putting hits on 5-0
Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, 
the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is living fat and
The Boogie Down
, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out

Everyday I'mma polli bout, who's the best hotty out?
And will they ever let Gotti out?
Am I real? Feel free to try me out
Guaranteed eternally, you signin out
I only bang quarters, not a thing shorter
Than a dime, rhyme like a crime scene reporter
Thought shorty would lose but the game taught her
Hoodrat just like Thelma, James' daughter
Killer put you on, got you laced in Bucon
Bledest stone, where the place you call home?
[Foxy Brown]
Brooklyn girl, plotted then I took the world
You know the whole drill, Na Na so Ill
Make mills and escro, decimals
Cancun, Mexico, X-and-O
Bracelets got all, along with gold
Now it's platinum rings, songs is sold
Hot from the jumpstart, let the game spark
Thriller, will I shot to the top of the charts
[Nas Escobar]
Head honcho, cat Esco
Push everything from the Coupe to the Fo'
Never love a ho, get my dick sucked
Smoke the chocolate, trick my chicks up
Pass all the ki's to mami, whip it up
Fox get the B's, Bonnie live it up
Chorus: (x2)
Your love, so good
You deserve some hardcore
[Nas] That Firm shit, that Firm shit
[Foxy Brown]
FIRM, NIGGA WHAT? Get my twat licked
Never love a trick, get him for his chips
Fuck him and his dick, nigga where the six?
He actin like a bitch, he should've known this
Got the stone the wrist, I ain't no bonin this
Bomb ass shit, I could play with my shit
[Nas Escobar]
Rap niggas, capitalise, stack figures
Cognac is that liquor
Got me all numbed out, now I'm in the street with the guns out
Niggas better take me home, 'fore I dumbs out
Might fuck around, lay somethin down
Wit mad niggas out here to see that shit
We that click, runnin shit up in New Yick
All the way down to Hicktown, layin it down
[Foxy Brown]
Fox be the classiest, the sassiest
The clubs, all thugs grab my wrists, offer me moselle Crist
More of the shit to hold you with
Keep hatin I'mma fold your bitch
Should've known to control that chick, hoes mad cos I roll the 6
Doe full of ices, black Isis
Sidewalk, my niggas stay fuckin your girl
The rest be, hoes in stretch jeans with red seams
Take it from me, let a nigga dream
Make em lick that, get the cat for his cream
Chorus (x2)
[Foxy Brown]
It's about time I reverse that
Bitches learn game, rehearse that
It ain't no love, ma remember that
Ya hoes wanna slap while I got him on his back
Tryin to hurt that
[Nas Escobar]
Think you're grown, half the niggas sittin at home
Watchin the kids, while you're gettin it on
I'm too smart for that, caught you creepin
Receipts in your Prada bag, suites every weekend
Spendin my doe, I coulda spent that on hydro
You ain't slick enough, think I don't know
[Foxy Brown]
Dumb ass, think I slept on your bum ass

Chorus (x3)
Interlude to fade

So many niggas get fucked up in the game
See that's where they get caught out there in that word "Game"
Cause its not no fuckin game
When you hear shells coming at cha
Hot Ones from a shotgun I bet nigga runs faster
Loose a shoe to get away from a blaster
Think about that casket you don't wanna be in that shit
Quick to take his signin you taking every bodies package
Money over Bitches was a loyal practice
So you act is if money was no object
Spinin 5 zues trips for your whole projects
Epcot center linins for ya bitches roli's for dogs
Now we in the mall slayin by his bitches
Everyday I reminiscing how he was living having fun
Cause any day could have led to prison
Not for a short bid cause if the feds ever caught kid
It be like 25 years conspiracy
Another 25 for rico snatching up him and his people
He had his jeep bullet proof with silencers on the desert eagle
Flipping bricks in Gary Indiana
He had it locked down from the streets to the slammer
Only trusted Two things his trigger and his hammer
Used to be a bum till had a six month run
Had a loss suit three G's the case was won
Met with Mexican hoya cop boya
Bought barber shop named it after c shaday
There where they found his body
In a barber chair face down, bullets in his chest
Sliced apart from the waist down
Planned to sell his shop stick hoya for everything he got
Take jewels and his 5
Then his shoes where cemented
Drop his body in the tide but hoya was wise
Even when he ain't around he got ears and eyes
Gotta stay a step ahead of this game to stay alive
Chorus (X2)
Always wanted things always wanted cash
To Live fast get the girls with tha biggest ass
Fuck her 9 to 5 gotta drive a 5
Now that I got it the Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive
Coke head Saundra she grew in Gruwana
Her man was large and Saundra was his baby mama
Stayed in drama Fighting with hood rats that he was fucking
No job all day she did nothing
They son was 7 years old, she really was a wifey
First should she would transport blow overnight for a G
He paid up front they laid up once
She got pregnant she would dead it
She had a boy, named her son infinite after his father who did dirt
She didn't noses after would follow
Capsules and bottles and crack in the back of his baga
He let her drive while he drove the burgandy 5
He often talked about how he wants to murder these guys
]From off of burger street, had nat workin the street
Lifestyle richest nigga from how he use to be
Never thought he'd rock diamonds never took weakness for kindness
That's how he gradually grew
Did a Favor for a favor
 now the nigga in with the crew
And Now he live major house in dix hills next to Brook Shields
With the cook and the maid shit was real
Saved his first bill, maid, and his bodega
Good Luck playa sign on the paper taped to the window
Escaped from a would be kidnap
And slept and thought niggas fearless rep until he got wet
Would had the world in his hands his girl did a scam
The owners rich is boning niggas to get rid of her man
Welcome To The Game Baby
Chorus (X2)
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...
The Hardest Thing To Do Is Stay Alive...

Napster didn’t invent peer-to-peer music sharing networks, rap music fans did. Before rap was ever recorded in corporate studios, or distributed to millions via articulated lorry or fibre optic cable, it was sold, shared, and swapped by thousands of New York’s poorest youth. The spread of affordable – and recordable - cassette tape players from 1975 onwards (see graph below) was the technological tinder on which New York City’s rap scene first ignited. Without it, rap music as we know it probably wouldn’t exist.
Though the data in the graph do not show trends specific to rap music, they do show the transition from vinyl to cassette tapes as the “industry standard” recording medium in the U.S. It seems a fair assumption that the sale of ever increasing numbers of tapes (as seen on the graph) is 
a good measure of how many people used tape players, and thus the market penetration of the technology.
 The critical distinction between cassette tapes and vinyl – for those who haven’t spotted it yet – is that tapes gave music fans the ability to duplicate content via tape-to-tape recording. No reproductive method this simple, fast, effective, or cheap had been available to consumers before, and it changed the market for recorded music in some fundamental ways. The graph shows the steady rise of cassette tapes as the recording medium of choice from 1975 to 1990, the period that rap music emerged as the cultural production of some of America’s most deprived young people.
Was this mere coincidence? Or was the rise of cassette technology intimately linked to the spread of rap music in its earliest years? I would argue that coincidence barely figures in this story.
In 1992, musicologist[1] Simon Frith wrote that the “the rise of rock [music in the 1950s had] depended on a broader social change – the appearance of youth as a pop music market.”[2] Similarly, many years before rap became extensively commercialised - and its audience became majority white - the rise of rap music depended on the appearance of black youth as a music market. New technology played an important part in this process.
Recordable cassette tapes revolutionised the market for recorded music.  With blank tapes cheaply available, home recording virtually removed cost as a barrier to the consumption of music. For the first time (in history?), a fan’s ability to privately consume their favourite artist’s music was not limited by their ability to pay for it. 
Many early rap fans in the Bronx - and other similarly deprived inner city areas where rap first thrived - could not have afforded regular vinyl releases.
 But now they didn’t need to. Music was freely available to anyone with the desire to seek it out, and the few cents it cost to buy a blank tape.
New York rapper Nas referred to this as the “cassette lifestyle”.
[3] It consisted of spending large amounts of time compiling personal mixtapes by listening out for favourite songs to record from the radio, or by trading sections of sought after music with friends.[4] With cassette technology, enthusiasm and perseverance could be substituted for purchasing power, and this simple fact resulted in unusually high levels of cultural consumption amongst some of America’s poorest youth.
Although most rap music could be compiled onto personal mixtapes for free, a vibrant market in cutting edge rap music also began to develop. Hip-hop journalist Havelock Nelson described a man he saw selling tapes on the streets of New York: “The same way drug dealers whisper and gesture when attempting to make a sale, that’s the way this brother was hawking tapes. I guess hustling is just in the blood of some brothers, and hip-hop was the latest hot commodity.”[5]
Many famous rappers used these cheaply produced tapes to promote themselves at the start of their careers. “Groups like the Fearless Four started making home tapes which they sold… in the streets of Queens, Manhattan, and the Bronx.”[6]  These tapes were often “given out to friends, to cab drivers or to kids with giant tape boxes” to help spread the new sounds.[7] The low cost of reproduction meant that a rapper’s music could spread virally through social networks, and a rapper could achieve local cult status with almost no promotional costs.
Rapper MC Eiht said:
"I started doin’ little tapes for my neighbourhood, talkin’ bout the homies [read as ‘local youth’] and the niggas we didn’t like ... [Then] all the homies hear your tape [and] next thing you know, you got fifty niggas ridin’ around with your tape [playing]."[8]
During the 1970s and early 1980s, rap music was largely excluded from commercial radio, and wasn’t played at most mainstream discos or nightclubs either. Informal sharing via cassette tapes filled this promotional void, and became a substitute for access to traditional forms of publicity. As rapper Lil Rodney Cee explained, “Rap was travelling through tapes so people was [sic] coming from Jersey who had family in New York. [And] they’d hear the rap tapes and them back to Jersey.”[9] This peer-to-peer promotion established rap as an authentic cultural form, and developed a broad, committed, and responsive fan base on which later efforts toward commercialisation built.
It is difficult to imagine how rap music could have achieved a similar level of market penetration in communities with such low levels of disposable income without the advent of exceptionally low-cost reproduction and distribution technology. It is also challenging to estimate the precise impact of this technology.
Probably the best estimate of the extent of bootlegging and home taping came from an investigation into the “pass-along” rate of The Source, a monthly hip-hop magazine aimed at the same market. Its editor, James Bernard, estimated a pass-along rate of 11-15 readers for every copy sold; a rate three to four times higher than the average magazine industry pass-along estimates.[10] Given that tapes could be reproduced so that the lender could retain the original copy and still distribute the music to friends, the true pass-along rate for tapes is likely to be far higher than even Bernard’s estimate.
Cassette tapes, and the peer-to-peer networks they spawned and developed, meant that audience demographics for mass-distributed music included, for the first time, people who could not afford to pay for it. The result was a remarkably broad social fan base amongst some of the poorest consumers in the U.S. Without this technological innovation it seems unlikely that rap would have spread as far or as fast.
Though this method of distribution did not initially generate large profits for rappers or record labels, both the breadth and commitment of this social fan base would later become the basis for a new approach to monetising rap music, and eventually all music: cross-promotion.
So the next time you hear about how Napster invented peer-to-peer sharing, or how viral content is a new phenomenon reliant on internet technology, you can tell them about New York in the 1970s, where poor young people with tape decks, radios, and a few friends and strangers to share with, started the world’s first modern music-sharing network, decades before a Tweet was anything more than a sound the birds made.

[Verse 1: Nas]
Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, flows that I try
, 
close your eyes
Picture me rollin'
, 
sixes
, 
money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed
 
Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater
Model dater,
 
big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
For this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen
, 
Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest
[Diddy]
Money is power motherfucker
I got millions of thugs on salary
[Hook: Diddy]
[Verse 2: Nas]
You wanna hate me then hate me;
 
what can I do
But keep gettin' money
, 
funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin' 
"that's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with"
Hate on me
, 
I blew but I'm the same O.G
People warn me, when you're on top, there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect, ho?
Nickname Esco
, 
took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right
[Diddy]
You think I'mma come this far, and let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too!
[Hook]
[Diddy] I like this, I like the way this feels
[Verse 3]
It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates;
 
I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows,
 
the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop,
 
and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up but I flipped on these ducks
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the theory of man
Became a monster
, 
on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come from day one, forever ballin'
C'mon
[Diddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!
[Hook]

[NAS]
Yeah, The Firm
Trackmasters,
 
Escobar,
 Allure
Keep it raw
Hey yo, The Bridge, keep rockin'
We coming through, bottles poppin'
Allure, when your album droppin'?
The place is packed
Many faces, there's some I know
And some know me from buying cases
Cash stack, shorties peepin'
Is she Puerto Rican, or half black
Puff, puff give, I need to live
Please pass that so I can zone
Maybe shoot a jewel in baby girl dome
It's a crazy world
Lemme drive you home, lets go
By the way, the name's ESCO
The platinum range make your man know he wet those
If he front I got the tech close
To you much respect goes, the bond true
Had to put it on you
Allure you, you gotta leave
I'll call you , it's been real
[Allure]
Boy I can't understand it
See I never really felt
Like I do when I'm around you baby
And I just can't explain it
But I'm feeling so high
And I just can't deny
It's on you
Tell me you want my love
Baby please don't deny
What you're feeling inside
Say you've been thinking of
Holding me, touching me, feeling my every need
1 - Head over heels
It seems so real
I feel like I'm falling in love
I'm lost inside of my desire
Oh baby can't you see
I'm falling for ya head over heels
Baby, baby I'm longing
Just to have you to myself
I don't want nobody else, no
Baby my body's calling
Won't you come get my love
Because I really need you so much
Tell me you want my love
Baby please don't deny
What you're feeling inside
Say you've been thinking of
Holding me, touching me, feeling my every need
[NAS]
So much in common
I know you like the way I act
You been around real cats
All your life, since way back
You still got it
Cuz you was turned down once
Guess you learned
Ain't no future with them burnt out stunts
Left the hood to get your own thing
We're home team
Pushing through, watch ya chrome gleam
Yeah aiight, you probably heard that my pipe game's tight
Rocking VeVe S stones
Powder blue whips with egg headlights
The scent of weed gettin' all in your weave
I put out the trees
And crack the moon roof only for you to breathe
You get a extra set of keys
I tell the world while I'm out on tour
Keep your hands off my girls
Allure
[Allure]
Baby, can't you see
How you make me feel
Oh, baby can't you see
I'm fallin' for you head over heels
Repeat 1 until fade

[Hook: Jully Black, and (un-credited male vocals)]
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I, fill the tank up, put gas, and be out the front door in a (flash)
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It ain't you, it's the thing you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would've fell with you
To Hell with you
[Verse 1: Nas]
If Heaven was a mile away, and you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens, would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder, finally believe in his power
Even if you couldn't see him, but you could feel him, would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting? would you try to put the keys down?
Thinking every drug sale that you make in the streets, he can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high? would he stop smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet, he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
, and 
I bet you there's a Heaven for a atheist
It's hard taking this, racist planet, where they take a younger brother in a hand-cuff
Even if he innocent, "Nigga get on the car! put your motherfucking hands up!"
Thinking I'mma lose it
My mom's in chemo, three times a week yo, keep trying but people
It's hard
, and 
God your young soldier's not so bold, but needs you
This world's my home but world I will leave you
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Nigga what you think, I'mma stop 
building
?
I'mma stop feeling like I'm 
Amistad's great- great-grandchildren?
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the 
quarter water
 days, 
in the hallways making fake gold caps
With the 
Reeses Pieces
 wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as 
Ill and Al Skratch
Game time took 'em cats, never looked back
, 
Cristal, blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me, you see the broads and Bentleys is nothing
Lest my niggas spend it all with me, I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all about some new kicks free
Of any autographs, and not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable, making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on a hook, there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise, preachers touching on alter boys
Sodomizing, not realizing God is watching, before the Lord
How could they do the Devil's work?
A man give another man head in Church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought, wishing that I fled the earth
[Hook]
[Outro: Nas]
You trapped in your own Hell
Everyday I wake up, I'm blessed
Everyday you wake up and breathe another breath, you blessed
To all them niggas running around talking about:
"I'm fucked up", "I got to get on", "I got to...", "I'm in the grind", "I'm fucked up"
Yeah we all in the grind, but look at the beautiful shit around you, it's a beautiful life
All my niggas locked up, keep your heads up, Heaven's just a mile away
I'm talking Heaven on Earth, ain't got nothing to do with money, got nothing to do with nothing material
I'm talking about Heaven in your own heart, in your own world baby, in your own existence
To my mom's look at me baby, I love you girl, your boy's shining
, 
God's son

[Hook]
Chain gleaming, switching lanes, two-seater
Hate him or love him for the same reason
Can't leave it, the game needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in
So in God's Son we trust
Cause they know I'm gonna give em what they want
They looking for a hero, I guess that makes me a hero
[Verse 1]
Another chapter of the cleanest rapper, distinguished gentlemen
Crooks and Castle on his back, Maybacher
Exotic lady eye-catcher, holla at ya, call me the chiropractor
Working like Muay Thai class, get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rocking D Boy, Fila, velour in one-ninety black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shopping
Used to be train robbing, face covered in stocking - I'm him
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Rubber-grip-holder, reloader, come at me
I'ma rip your soliders in half,
 
silverback ape,
 
nickel-plated mag
Young, rich and flashy; young bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes 'til ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niqqas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berettas and movin' raw
 
to chilling in wine cellars
Sticks and humidors, that's what I call mature
That's what I call a G, that's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta, to the fullest shit
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th, that's my dream
So I can be more clean,
 
as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly, that's why they fear me, let's go
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
This universal apartheid, I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blocking y'all from going to stores and buying it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was riding with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs, they said Nas why is he trying it
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winning
Forgetting Nas the only true rebel since the beginning
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, or Billy Joel they can't sing what's in their soul
So Untitled it is, I never change nothing, but people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas being told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it, so shit, I'mma drop it
Like it or not, you ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustler in the studio, cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called, I'm unbeatable y'all, let's go

[Verse 1]
The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in "Set It Off"
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm 
puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', "Hi Nas"
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, "Sorry. I made plans
 at 
Ray's Boom-Boom Room
"
Nine push-ups... Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the 
Patron
 Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's
Sedated from L's
, 
380 cocked
, 
naked ladies laid up in tails
Like 
Whodini
 I chose, 
gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know... When will they learn
Nas need a queen not a ho to...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't fuck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy
[Hook: Claudette Ortiz]
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be groovin'
But let's take... it... slow
[Verse 2]
One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife- play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue... A woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany,
 
you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbeque I call Professor and Ak
'Cuz u... point out my enemies
, 
someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cuz I'm lovin' ya energy
[Hook: Kelis]
[Verse 3]
Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like no one else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we... suck and fuck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we stop
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billy Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must...
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't fuck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy
[Hook: Claudette & Kelis]
(Claudette) (2x)
I can be... What you said
That you need... I can be...All that
I can be... I can have your back... baby

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
This shit's special
DJ Khaled!
[Verse 1: Scarface]
And if I cry two tears for her
That will be the most that I would give to her
She left me stranded in my nightmares
Taking pictures of my memories she right there
Twisting on the blade in my heart, deep
Always on my mind so I can't sleep
She used to tell me she was all mine
Now the only way I see the broad is online
I'm doing drugs trying to feel you
I'm killing me trying to kill you
I built my whole life around ya
I thought I found it all when I found her
Shopping sprees on whatever coast
How'd you really feel, I may never know
And as I ride through these streets
With my hand on my heat, eyes red from the sweets, I
Realize some things never change
Once in love and it's gone you don't look at it the same, nigga
Fuck love cause she don't live here
I'm soaked in blood but I'm still here
Hip Hop heartbreaks
Straight-laced, deep bass, 808s plus the mixtapes
Got a nigga feeling like I up and left ya
Get away now you all in the lectures
Being studied by the college's professors
Now I regret the day I met ya
(Bitch) I'll be the first one to say it
She ain't the one you want to play with
I fucked Hip Hop
[Verse 2: Nas]
And if I cry two tears for her
That would be the most that I can give to her
I am Joseph, Darryl, Jason,
 
Dr. Dre, O'Shea
And a host of those who passed away
Today I'm Drake, I'm Wayne, 2 Chainz
You say you want to rap, to this bitch you must commit
Then you're a slave to your grave, you won't get out, you cannot quit
She menstruates weekly, her vibe covers keep you warm
But the source to her heart is love, word up, right on
You know how girls are, she love when you licking on her world star
Kissing on her belly, trick on her at Onyx
Confused fans think that she illuminates demonic
But she's the object of my affections, God's essence, God bless her
She bought me Bentleys, Breitlings, made some friends resent me
For writing about my life, they thought I should have stayed quiet
She took me to places I would have never saw without her
And she took me from my girl powder
I doubt I'll ever be the same, hallowed be thy name
Give me strength so I don't do this dame like Orenthal James
Brad warned me while driving this auburn Ferrari
Never follow in her games, I fuck around and I'll be sorry
But I tried her used to ride her, for dollars not the fame
She slowed me down and had me guzzling on cups of lean
She's a middle-aged cougar, showing young'uns the dream
Noticed she wasn't breathing for a second then I screamed
"She's dead!" and everybody took it out on Nasty
I was just looking out for my music family
Wasn't trying to claim her to myself, she's yours
You can have her she's a motherfucking whore
I fuck Hip Hop
[Scratch Outro: DJ Premier]
And if I cry two tears for her, that would be the most that I would I give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
You say you wanna rap, to this bitch you must commit
I fuck hip hop
And if I cry two tears for her, that will be the most I can give to her
She ain’t the one you wanna play with
(I fuck hip hop)
And you all know how the story go



[Produced by Will.I.Am]
[Intro - Will.I.Am + (Nas)]
Hip hop
Hip hop (Ugh!)
Is dead (
Had to flip this track again, y'all!
)
Hip, hip hop
Hip hop (Ugh!)
Is dead
Hip, hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip, hip hop is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip, hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)
[Hook - Nas + (will.i.am)]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ
(Hip hop just died this morning
And she's dead, she's dead)
[Verse 1 - Nas]
Yeah, people smoke, chill, party, and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers on the llama
Revenge in their eyes,
 
Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya' "Nas helped grow us up"
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went deaf
So people, who's your top ten?
Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?
[Hook]
[Verse 2 - Nas]
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missing' the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why is that?
Cause Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
Cause we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I think they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me, we here for life, B
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not taking it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together
All together now
[Hook]
[Verse 3 - Nas]
Everybody sound the same,
 
commercialize the game
Reminiscing when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of Vodka
R.I.P
., 
we'll donate your lungs to a rasta
Went from turntables to MP3's
From 
"Beat Street"
 to 
commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm looking' over my shoulder
It's about eighty people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut

[Hook: Mark B. Mayfield]
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
[Verse 1: Nas]
Yea, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'
Salivatin' at the mouth
, 
South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be givin' up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout thirty years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
Waves spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition aging
I got families I'm feeding cause my mans is bleeding
Every five seconds look in all directions
I come through prepared; I give 'em a call
"I'm close, bring them guns downstairs"
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder
Two niggas dead, Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day
Friday, somebody-gotta-die-day
Saturday, put the gat away
Chillin' wit your chick and a bag of haze
Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way
Cause Sunday back to gunplay
Mo' shit start over nothin'
And get finished quick cause the art of repercussion
Yeah, I seen it, a G' going out indecent
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the 
SIG Sauer
 
on me now I'm scared to die
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty
But he old school,
 
holdin' a .38
, 
he in his forties
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob
A man rather die than live on his knees and starve
Cops steady askin' your man what happened
First he tell then he stop, like he not really rattin'
Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggas bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop
The streets lie, so you better be cautious
Your man'll fry you plus, everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm flossin
'
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them
Queensbridge projects has taught him, and that's for life
You heard me right, I got the block
[Outro: Mark B. Mayfield]
When the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

[Hook: Arlissa]
Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine, now rain is all there is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody when all I want is
All I want is you
[Verse 1: Nas]
Can we talk for a bit, brought you a miniature Yorkie
When you walk I mean you switch it engulfs me
Lick you off my lips like salt and vinegar chips
But now you act salty verbally you assault me
Often I'm in the star maxim yeah my star ship
Take me out tonight darling I beg your pardon
This wasn't part of our arrangement
Now you're bangin on my door I need an order of estrangement
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
What you did to the kid ain't a bit as capital punishment
You wanna split that quick already done with us
You're the one I spend money with, winters and summer with
Thought it was more than sexual we was on some other ish
Vision your silhouette while in Tuscany
Luxury when you trusting me stressing me
I just up and leave, i'm staying psycho free
Hard to love somebody else but you
But now I'm missing you Arlissa
[Bridge]
You you you you you
All I want, all I need, yeah
Is you you you you you you you
Just you, oh
[Hook]
Oh it's hard to love somebody when there's no more love to give
Oh you took away my sunshine, now rain is all that is
And it's easy to get lost when you got nowhere left to go
Oh it's hard to let somebody, it's hard to let somebody
When all I want is you, when all I want is you
You you you, you you you, you you you
When all I want is you

[Missy]
This is for my ghetto motherfuckers, uh
[Nas]
Uh, forty side felony
Felony, misdemeanor
The charge is murder
Escobar CBR bikes
I'm switching gears
Headlights, shine so bright
Bitches freeze like deers
Them fiends want that deep boy
Feds send in a decoy, pack that heat boy
Push ya where ya rest in peace boy
Get your mama's house shot up
Bodies all chopped up
When them bodies pop up, I ain't getting' locked up
My Bentley cruise the block, with the sun roof top
Hood rats jumpin' on my jock cause I blew up the spot
Crushin' your Benz, crushin' your Navigator system
My QB piece make y'all niggas tuck your shit in
It's Nas in your area, Queens 'bout to tear it up
Braveheart y'all scared of us, real niggas, they be us
[Missy & Lil' Mo]
What's your name, cause I'm impressed?
Can you treat me good, I won't settle for less
You a hot boy, a rock boy
A fun toy, tote a Glock boy
Where you live, is it by yourself?
Can I move with you, do you need some help?
I cook boy, I'll give you more
I'm a fly girl, and I like those
1 - [Missy & Lil' Mo]
Hot boyz

And the Bentley's, and the Rolls Royce
Playin' hardballs with them Platinum Visa's
[Missy & Lil' Mo]

Are you riding alone, can I be your date?
Come get me, get me, don't diss me, don't trick me
Got some friends, can they come too?
Can you hook them up wit' some boyz like you
A hot boy, a rock boy, on top boy
And I like those
Repeat 1
[Eve]
Yo only take 'em thugged out
Slightly bugged out, fuck with his tongue out
Know the job ain't getting done, until the body getting drugged out
Hot boy, keep me right
Play your part and I'll keep it tight
Where else you gonna be in the middle of the night
But up in the sheets with me aiight
Gangsta, true to your gang, street master
You the one I need when there's beef, street blaster
Ain't afraid to stop a cat, plus pop a cat, huh
Soldier, cash money, rule your world
What's topping that?
Huh, S-4-3-0 keep me on my toes
Get a tingle in my spine, what spot? Only he knows
He's a hot boy, Missy sing it out and I'm gon' spit it
Ruff Ryders scream it loud, daddy is you with it
If your team can't handle my bitches then we gon' ride
Brickhouse stallions, keep thugs open wide, huh
'Illadelph's best E-V-E stay committed
Mess with many, but if he ain't the realer
I ain't with it, with it
[Q-Tip]
Yo, mami, what the deal?
Ain't no heat fuckin' hotter than the heat a nigga hold
I think you really should be told that I deal with long shafts
That keep a long blast (blast)
Now look at a nigga and peel off fast (come on)
Word you got your girlfriend
Word, she can get it too
Fuck it though, I'm honest yo
I'm saying though, let's play it through
Getting cinematic with it
Niggas if you got it, hit it
Fuck the dumbness
Hit it till its numbness
[Missy & Lil' Mo']
Hot boy
Baby you got what I want
Won't you really come and satisfy me
I be lovin' you like endlessly
(Everyday all day)
Hot boy
Baby you got what I want
Won't you really come and satisfy me

[Verse One: Nas]
What?
Back to back Benzes, wit the wild gremlins
Gaudiere style lenses, talons in the 40 cal, this is
Life now, let me find out, you want the life style of mine
No pal of mine
Runnin' wit goons wit knife wounds from jail time
Got the squad lookin' like tycoon, we all shine
While we parle wit the flyest mommy of 25th street
Watch how honey in the Lex do it
I'm in the 6 V wit the 12 next to it
You wanna stick me, then put ya best to it
Or die black
, we see you in Allah Kingdom you try that
Check the fly cat, 
2 point 5 multiply that
Cash rules
, 
on my arm I flash jewels, and tatoos
You can look, but don't touch we bad news
[Verse Two: AZ]
American Me, elgancy, treasury
Wit the hopes to be rich before the bury me
Born a Baptist, but moved on to higher practice
My fire ashes, only macks I interact wit
We all Dons, strong arm, all on calm
But if it's war we on, comin' for niggas who crossed me wrong
Select features, sit back connect the pieces
Inject the thesis, spoke to my pops and left him speechless
He saw me sprout, goin' through worlds that wore me out
Never call me out, bitches and money, that's what we all about
Through all the routes landed here, beach houses wit the chandaliere
Me & my crew, mad cans of beer
It's copin', live vibe, still eyes open, it's clear
Presidential Suites at the Tangiers
[Chorus: AZ & (Nas)]
(How you livin' on your block?)
AZ:
Mines is hot, how you livin' on your block?
(I got it locked, what's goin' down on your side, who got shot?)
Same shit 
dun
(Yeah, alright I'll meet you 
up top
)
Yo it's hard to shake this feelin' that I might get knocked
(
Dun you know it don't stop, we can't close up shop
)
[Verse Three: AZ]
VVSin'
, 
nuttin' less than how we steppin'
Coupes kidded, cuties wear the sleazy dress &
See me flexin' through the hood, d's be stressin'
Illegal search, tryin' to find weapons for gun possession
Never want for questions, every move made is destined
Black professors, let's take it back to the essence
Another version, of the Goldie, mack, pimp servin'
Convince the urban, project, ghetto prince emergin'
Half Hispanic
, 
hollow tips, massive damage
The path was granted, loaded gats, blast the cannon
Chipped up, 
live by morals don't get it mixed up
Dis what?, millionaire strut, wit the Crist cup
Switched up, slow goin', gold showin'
Doe flowin', eyes don't lie, hoes knowin'
Main attraction, lace love in the latest fashion
Trained in mackin' never, rockin' Gators clashin'
Assorted wear, 
AZ, Firm extrordinaire
Make it more severe, lockin' shit down all this year
[Verse Four: Nas]
Nowhere to go from here, but the top of this sphere
Nuttin' stoppin' us here, we lockin' this here
Wit the black toaster by my hip bone, fuck a holster
See me at the Copa, platinum choka
The God's wit me, 
mad blunt smoke, it's hard to miss me
Pick one out of two dimes to twist me
New nines is crispy
, mind on chips, rhyme on shit
That's strictly made for cats whose rich
Excuse me, is that your bitch in my 6
Turnin' up the volume when she hear my hits
On her wall mad flicks, now you want me blasted
But don't get it confused over this rap shit
Kinda laced, lookin' at diamonds in my onyx face
Oyster perpetual Roly wit the day & date
Y'all playa hate this
To fly for female singers who get face lifts
& fake titties
We rule the world & take cities
I dreamed of this son
Happy we made it past the jakes, fakes
And fiends of the slum (Wor)
[Chorus: AZ & (Nas)]
[Outro: AZ & (Nas)]
(Unh...What?) It's a doe thing, niggas know the game don't change
(un, un) from the Coke game (Coke game) to the dope game
From a slow brain (Dope game) Ha, ha (Fuck a no name)
We done did it again son, they can't fuck around (No doubt, un)
You know the game don't stop, from the Coke game to the Dope game
(Firm Biz, Firm Biz...un...Total Package)
Niggas know that the game don't stop
From the Coke game to the Dope game
Fuck a no name 
(un, un B.K., Q.B., un)
That the game don't stop, from the Coke game
To the Dope game, know the doe... 
(Escobar, Sosa, ha ha, un)
Niggas know that the game don't stop (Firm Biz)
From the Coke game to the Dope game
Niggas know that the game don't stop
Niggas know that the game don't stop
Niggas know that the game don't stop
From the Coke game, to the Dope game, fuck a no name

Ma, I'm sorry who the fuck 
I AM
, 
I can't trust my fans
Out of luck, no constructive plans
My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand
You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man
Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't
But every church in the world can't save our children
I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be
Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately
Them bullets had some other names on it, a brother was blind
I hit the L, then we yell out, "It wasn't my time!"
I loaded up shells, one by one, you smelled blunt from my room door
Little Nasir was at war
And little did I care what you saw
Crew deep with a few heat, now it's time we settle the score
But in the projects, I visit Muhammad, in linen garments
Preaching Man, Woman, and Child, the living Prophet
And I'm similar, 
Nasir Bin Olu Dara
Visqu Allah, 
fist full of dollars
 in the dice game God
The Ice King, God, the Black Christ, elegant stance
Clothes fit me like a crime boss, 
the medicine man
I see the world collapsing, young pregnancies
Young girls are fasting in they Sasoon jeans, no prophylactic
All this fashion and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary
N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me
Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with money bags
Stop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast
And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York
You show off, I count off when you sample my voice
I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens
Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding?
Is he H to the izzo, M to the izzo?
For shizzle you phony,
 
the rapper version of Sisqo
And that's for certain, you cloned me, your wack clothes line
I'd rather Sean John,
 
bore me with your fake coke rhymes
And those times, they never took place, you liar
Un was your first court case, you had no priors
You master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick
Have you surrounded, you and them faggot you down with
While they riding NAS, trying to boost their careers
Corny as Cormega,
 
all you Hip-Hop queers
Since Illmatic
, 
It Was Written
: 
I Am...
Nastradamus
That's the answers to the puzzle I gave you, now here's a promise
My next few albums, instead of projects
They'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics
Come in my hood, but bring the guns with you
, it's dark
Headed through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx
Headed through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts
New Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town, every block
I'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page
Did crimes and headline on stage
I signed a contract, so here it is, you have it
Streets disciple
, I'm 
Stillmatic

[Produced by Fatboi]
[Hook:]
I've been drinking, I've been thinking
What my life would be without you
Come too far to turn back now
Think about all the things we've been though
I'm in love with the hustle, hustle hustle
I'm in love with the hustle, hustle hustle
[Verse 1: Rocko]
I'm the big of the barb of the bus (?) chef
The C-E-O, the rapper,
 MC Rocko the best, I got a million hustles
I'm a doctor, I'm the lawyer, but me not no judge
I'm an accountant, me need it all, me not gone budge
Natural born hustler, yes, that we are
Live in color flow, look I'm king in my ivory
Way in way out, train a boxer, I do it all
Realtor, builder, painter, artist
Play a little softball too, come to pitching, I'm the hardest
Kick back, getting tatted up drinking
Louis XIII, throwing back shots, thinking
[Hook:]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Veteran reporter
, prosecutor avoid her
I never trusted the Department of Justice
Police corruption, drugs, what's the explanation
Nas a Afrocentric-Asian, roam this ghetto plantation
Under surveillance, gotta pay another bailiff
Gotta spray another Mac, ducking all these bullets hailing
It's not enough crackheads like it used to be
Unless you selling bricks, you ain't really seeing G's
Gotta bust a strip real quick, pills or lean
Get whatever from a pharmacy, it's either that or a robbery
Catching niggas shining, book his punk ass
You know the look on our faces when we want cash
Get the bank card, social withdrawal, the money gone
Before you know what hit ya'll
Women stopped selling sex, started forging checks
Niggas got their video on the Star, they mixtape on the net
Let's hustle
[Hook:]
[Verse 3: Rocko]
Put some food on the table, everybody grab a plate
But didn't nobody cook, nobody brought to groceries
Took my homies to the water, taught 'em how to fish
Some niggas lazy, don't rather you feed 'em - I said I'm done
Blood sucking leaches, fuck 'em, I don't need 'em
Hustler niggas on it, that's the motto
H-N-O, Rocko
I already know my M-O, grind get dope
Anything ya'll (?)
With my (?) cause she plug with the boy
I know the lingo, I'm a hustler, I play with them toys
I know how to make that mail, everything stamped up
Letter A, number one, first at everything
Settle for nothing, I want better things
[Hook:]

[INTRO]
Dre, he a Compton-Compton O.G
Nas, he a QB-QB true G
Do the history
[Verse 1: Nas]
Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together like every several years
To sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax sippin' Cliquot in Rio, stupid fuckers
Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod
, and 
watching fly bitches with grey eyes
Wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? - cause I can vision
Collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take, is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude
So crack the Patron,
 
it's on heathens, The God's back
Hard body, Mr. Jones never leaving
[Hook: Marsha]
Hustlers, dealers,
 
drop-top riders
Make that cake,
 
cop two five fivers
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds
East to West Coast we riders
[Breakdown: Nas, (Game) x2]
He a Compton-Compton O.G
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)
(What you got's)
 
A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots
[Verse 2: Game]
1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
"Illmatic" on the top shelf, "The Chronic" on the left homie
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me
So fuck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack
Ripped the package off "Illmatic" and bumped that
For my niggas it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a
 
"New York State of Mind"
Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm,
 
bangin' The Firm
Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm makin 'em burn
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned"
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I stopped beefin' with niggas, cause I'm "Ether" to niggas
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
"If I Ruled the World" I summons all you weak rap niggas to death
[Breakdown: Nas, (Game)]
He a Compton-Compton 
O.G
(Mix that with a 
QB-QB
 true G)
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, the Jordans sportin'
Come off the dice game with a fortune walking, you a walking coffin'
The musket I tucked it, you bluff it I bust it
You're sideways talking, so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
Fuck ass niggas, get bucked ass niggas
Pluck ashes
 - of 
Cuban cigars
, you fooling with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that "Soul Plane" movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm busting
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the gatling on,
 
and I start clapping
Nasty man, from bagging grams and running from cops
To a mill' on the hand, a mill' on the watch
, 
I'm fucking with Doc
[Hook: Marsha]
Hustlers, dealers, drop-top riders
Make that cake, cop two five fivers
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds
East to West Coast we ridin'
[Breakdown: Nas, (Game)]
He a Compton-Compton O.G
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots

[Verse 1]
Man, Prince was a pimp, appolonia vanity
Sheila E. had me on the edge of insanity
Swore if I made it in music I'd be similar
Here I am, this is the future, I'm where the woman are
Rocking with ?, y'all need me, shine a spotlight up
In the sky ? like Batman, I pops right up
This is Nas hate if u must hate been hot since the days of cassette tapes
T-shirts over the thermals dripped in our memories
Sipping that Hennessey
 
.45th in my denim jeans
She told me she was my eyelashes
When we hump, I grunt just like a bull mastiff
They call me the best who ever did it
Only in the club one minute guess who I slip with
A chocolate dike ghetto thing sweet
We going to pop tonight, bon appetite
[Hook]
Do you know who I am? And she says
La lalala I already know
What we can't hold hands? And she says
La lalala I already know
You got to leave by three? you with me?
La lalala I already know
So until next week? you know, ma
La lalala I already know
[Verse 2]
You know, mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the nastiest sexiest thug of them all?
I seen her in the mall, she was wearing ?
Degarsole keyoke mose cherry cologne
She was looking very alone
'Til this big weightlifting Mr. Universe clone starts grabbing her own
But she can't stop looking im in the zone
One look at the kid she taking of her stone
Cash crazy ass crazy hair long
And baby amaze me because im in rare form
She like an ice cold bowl of post honeycomb
Followed me in the shop while I cop Nina Simone
Tap me on the shoulder I told her I her im on the phone
I played it off well nobody was on the cell
Shit, she said the tone?
She said mister so and so should I leave you alone?
I said
[Hook]
Tick-tock, tick-tock time is passing
Hello?
Turn the television off, focus here
[Verse 3]
You know, lover not a fighter
I'm the vagina liner reconstructor, bed sheet ruffler
For you freak girls undercover who loves ya?
I'm not a priest don't front for me, but step in my confessional
That's the bedroom, tell the truth I'll be impressional
Wait before you pass your collection plate
Show me you a professional so we straight?
She tried to kiss my lips, but no I don't do that
Want me to kiss my lips but not with a new jack
Few stacks spend my chips, yeah I do that
See the problem with you women is, look I got 'em
You can hear a mouse piss on cotton
You don't want to miss it then listen, stop stressing the man
We out to get as much sex as we can
And you roll wit the plan, shorty you lie
But you got to leave, 2:45
[Hook x2]

Nas - I Am...

[Intro]
La la
La la, la la, la la la la la la la
La la, la la, la la la la la la la
[Sample 1: Live at the Barbeque]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage
[Sample 2: Halftime]
Nas, why did you do it
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime
Check me out y'all
[Sample 3: It Ain't Hard to Tell]
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
[Sample 4: The World is Yours]
It's yours
Whose world is this?
The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
[Sample 5: One Love]
One what?
One love, one love, one love, one love
[Sample 6: The Message]
Fake thug, no love
You get the slug CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
[Sample 7: Street Dreams]
Street dreams are made of these
Everybody's looking for something
[Sample 8: If I Ruled the World]
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
[Skit]
[
Horse

Niggas heard that shit, man, the fuck is that, man?

[Horse]: 
Fuck all y'all faggot motherfuckers

[Intro]
Come along children
Now we're going to have a little music
Like old times
[Verse 1: Bliss]
Straight out the gate
This is our story we're scripting
Our film, our glorious vision
Our sound, our score that is written
In this sport, this division
My my, how the tournament's risen
Shit, everybody wants to soar in an instant
Everybody wants to be the Lord of the Ring wins
We laid dormant and listened
Hit ignition
Tore up the system
Elevate, accelerate and demonstrate
Live the dream and keep the horns to the mission
The formula's mixing
To fire the engine up and bring the force to the pistons
Never say never
Whenever together we give and go with the flow flipping like Jordan and Pippen
Slam the points home
Insight a roar to ignite the board
Wipe the floor with the notes that we write
And hold down with a mic to strike a chord
And then they can hear that thunder with the hooves
When we come with the hunger of the wolves
They were warned and the red flag flew
And his crewed cracked through
It's the running of the bulls
Today, we are together
Whenever we come together
The writers write
The cameras roll
Because together we got power
That's just rappin'
[Hook]
I said ay yo, I'mma lay my tracks down
I'm that freight train tearing through the sky in the clouds
I said ay yo, watch this hail mary fly
Keep on runnin' keep on gunnin' with this fire in my eyes
And I'm sky high, I'm sky high. Yeah, welcome to the time of my life
I'm sky high, I'm sky high, yeah, welcome to the time of my life
[Verse 2: Eso]
Sun, rain, snow or hail, we never got lost in the storm
And you best to respect that you never really know what you've got 'til it's gone
And a monster was born, with a want to explore
Life's roughest weather, but we know the code so we stuck together, yeah
And as life unravels, my mind's what fights my battles
I rhyme like lightning travels
, think quick, how you like them apples
Cuz I'm ready as I'll ever be, my head is in the melody, I'm flying now
Each feather is so heavenly, the energy of seven seas couldn't tie me down, bitch
So no fucking around dumb cunt, one jump and I'm up in the clouds
Trying to make that moment last, 
on a beat like Heath in a Joker mask
Which means, don' change that dial
Could've, would've, should've, just ain't our style
Shit, we got things to build
If your luck's low just know your wings are real
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
I'm so ill in my timeless timepiece
I keep a dime piece in arm's reach
Keep it 1000
From the housing projects I found my niche, you better find yours
I used to run with a lot of crime lords
Ramadan taught me use my mind more
Though I'm not religious
Nas y'all, just the realist
My imminent, conspicuous, synonym, sincere, rhyme and flow
Developed some images up in your mind bro
I survived continuing criminal enterprises that surrounded me
Innocent, no exaggeration
I don't pimp my past, I don't brag, no faking
My apartment had some break-ins
I'm thinking my past is worse than today is
That's when Biz Mark came with the vapours
It was anarchy,
 live in a heartbeat
Of the city that never sleeps
Niggas will gas you up to handle their beef
Peep game,
 you're dead if you don't think fast enough
We keeping it way street
[Hook]
[Bridge]
And my god, I feel alright
And my god, I feel alright, hey
And my god, I feel alright
And my god, I feel alright, hey

Kids!
]
I know I can (I know I can!)
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be!)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard it!)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be!)
[Verse 1]
Be, 
B-Boys and girls, listen up
You can be anything in the world,
 
in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Got her strung on that
Heroin, cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now, looks ugly and old
No fun cause when she reaches for hugs, people hold their breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'mma tell you how
Put your hands in the air, and take the vow
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Be, b-boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth
, 
but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Be, be, 'fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose
 
to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying "She's my Queen"
[Hook] x2
[Outro]
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music

[Verse 1: Nas]
Nas the Ice King
 
never seen twice the same spot
An introvert, watch like Yasser Arafat
I was the playboy up in every Marriott
And every Holiday Inn with somebody's girlfriend
The ladies started saying, Nas he get around
I thought about it and decided I should settle down
Met my little p but how am I gonna share my crown
Baby I'm the king I make the rules here on out
[Res]
Although you're an Ice King
Everything that you gave to me
Comes from the destitute and the torn
I can't live this life no more
Just another wasted one
Like a fallen star in Babylon
You said I was your princess, baby
I told you certain things you can't possess
So let me go, let me go
[Verse 2: Nas]
Here we go, yo
Now rollin on 22s, top down, seat back
Listening to slow grooves where gangsters be at
Watch say twelve, cop play themselves
Circling the corners like they got something on us
That's when my girl paged me, you ain't Kizzi and
I ain't Kunta, this ain't slavery, is you crazy?
There ain't no ties here that ain't my baby
[Res]
I've given until I break
The ground beneath us quakes
How can we grow when we've only begun
Forsaken beneath the sun
Although you're an Ice King
Everything that you gave to me
Comes from the destitute and the torn
I can't live this life no more

[Ludacris]
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
Now this is what they call poetry in motion
My soul bleeds on the paper, heart screams with emotion
It's my daily devotion
, 
the verses stay deeper than the ocean
So hip-hop you owe me a promotion!
Yeah I do a little boastin and braggin
What's all the commotion and naggin about? Cause I'm still the champ in the South?
Cause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin em out?
Well they're fired, and these pink slips, I'm handin em out
Cause this is "
Theater of the Mind
," consider it a sign
Of what's to come next, my money's just fine
Bank filled with dumb checks
, terrorist threat flow
Proceed to drop bombs like Mr. Funk Flex
But I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart
I do it with the beat box, I did it from the start
I do it for the dee jays, I do it for the charts
The Van Gogh flow
, Luda do it cause it's art
I do it for the fans
, I do it on command
I do it for the front row, I do it for the stands
I spit it for the hood, I do it for the block
And since nine years old I did it for hip-hop, so
[Hook One: Ludacris]
I don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
And I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
I do it for hip-hop
[Nas]
Uhh, uhh, uh
They say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward
Only niggas who really know me, who I talk with
They smile in the light, hate in the dark
You call it beef, to me, it's just a fuckin walk in the park
Cause you are who you are when nobody's lookin
That's who you are, so when the cash and the cars is gone
The day after tomorrow, don't be askin to borrow
Ski mask it hard, like the way you rap in your bars
I can ride on you and whoever,
 
devise new endeavors
I'm as live as a hive full of predators
Twenty thousand different species of bees
Some have poisonous stings, some just pollen their leaves
It's like rap, some just buzz, some will attack
Compromise their own life in fact
Sixteen years since my first sixteen
Pardon the rest of my niggas... but I'm the best who's ever did it!
[Hook Two: Nas] + (Ludacris)
(I don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops)
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop
Uh (I do it for hip-hop)
(And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks)
Why we do it kid? I do it for hip-hop
Yeah, I do it for hip-hop
Uh, I do it for hip-hop
[Jay-Z]
Hip-hop
! 
Started out in the park
We used to do it to avoid the narcs
I used to do it so the homeboy Clark
Can get the fuck off my back
 
while I knocked off these packs
I used to rap to impress my friends
To pass the time while I was gettin it in
Just so happens, I'm so illegal with the pen
They ain't want me doin anything illegal again
I lost a lot of dogs to these streets
I got Grammy awards on these beats
Thank God for Kool Herc
Without your shit I probably would've got merked
Shout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz
And even Jaz bum ass
Hip-hop helped me wash my rocks
These other rappers couldn't wash my socks
That's why I took the number one slot
The realest shit in rap comes from my voice box
Lord knows when I was on my clock
I prolly never woulda stopped, thank God for hip-hop
[Hook Three: Ludacris] + (Jay-Z) + {Both}
I don’t do for the cars and the fancy drops
(Uh, I do it for hip-hop)
(I do it for hip-hop)
I do it for hip-hop
And I don’t do for the chains and the flashin’ rocks
(Come on, I do it for hip-hop)
(I do it for hip-hop)
{I do it for hip-hop}

[Intro: Chrisette Michele]
Hip Hop
It will never die
Hip Hop
It will never, never die
[Verse 1: Nas]
Ghetto nigga strutting, with nothing but dreams in Queens broke
Mac-10s, you can smell the PCP smoke
Melle Mel told it real, in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember, we used to be close
Then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slipping in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast
, 
that black ice
Symbolize the rap life, it was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doing the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowing
, 
didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she want shellfish
Red Lobster was popping, standing on that line forever
I wish someone would step on my Bally leathers
Now it's whatever
Hip Hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift, but niggas never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn them, I was a tornado coming
He knew from the inside like the eye of a storm, and told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweeping leaves, socks to my knees
Home-made shorts, cut off Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wiping away eraser off the paper, man
I'm just trying to say it right
Big radio, tape's slowing down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I got to freeze them 'till they're ice cold
In the freezer later,
 
I'm staring at the speaker
Sunk in them 808s deeper,
 
cleaning my sneakers
With the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoestrings soak in water
[Outro: Nas (Chrisette Michele)]
(Live Hip Hop, Live) Ain't got nothing to do with Old School
(Live Hip Hop, Live) New School, Dirty South
(Give Hip Hop, Give) West Coast, East Coast, this about us
(Give Hip Hop, Give) This our thing, you know what I'm saying
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) This came from the gut, from the blood
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) From the soul, right here, man
(I Pray Hip Hop, Pray) This is our thing, man
(I Pray Hip Hop, Stays) You know? so I say what I say
(Live Hip Hop, Live) And I say what I say, and I mean it
(Live Hip Hop, Live) Y'all take it how you want to take it
(Give Hip Hop, Give) Because if you asking: "Why is Hip Hop dead?"
(Give Hip Hop, Give) It's a pretty good chance, you the reason it died, man
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) It's a pretty good, chance your lame ass, corny ass
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay) Is the reason it died, man
(I Pray Hip Hop, Pray) You don't give a fuck about it, you don't know nothing about it
(I Pray Hip Hop, Stays) You want this paper, be a hustler
(Live Hip Hop, Live) 
You a hustler, you ain't a rapper, get your paper man
(Live Hip Hop, Live) You know what I'm saying, but this rap shit is real
(Give Hip Hop, Give) Bitch, this shit is real: bitch
(Give Hip Hop, Give) *laughs*
(Stay Hip Hop, Stay)

[Intro: Nas]
Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know
[Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot
 
my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing, fashion
Designer clothes,
 
lacing your clique up
 
with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw
 
imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"
[Hook: Lauryn Hill (Nas)]
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons
, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
 (Could it be, if you could
Be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world (Still living for today, in
These last days and times)
[Verse 2: Nas]
The way to be, paradise like relaxing black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash,
 
Lost Tribe of Shabazz
, 
free at last
Brand new whips to crash
 then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl
, plus the 
Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling
, click rollin
Tricking 6 digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris,
 
I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release
 purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa
[Hook]
[Bridge]
And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
[Verse 3: Nas]
You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies
 
or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?
[Hook]

The year is 1994 and New Year’s is creeping up upon us. An MC from Queensbridge named Nas is currently keeping the streets on fire from coast to coast. Many brothers on the block, as well as Rap critics acknowledge Nas’ debut  LP Illmatic to be one of the greatest solo debuts of all time
Keep in mind, this after the riots. I think the O.J. Simpson trial was still on everybody's mind. Race, poverty and conflict were framing a lot of what was in America and Hip-Hop. I originally did this for a magazine called 
4080
. In it’s time, 4080 was a force of nature. I remember Harry Allen telling me how much he loved it. But the owner had addiction problems that forced it to close
Nas was  a legend already because of his verse on 
Live at the BBQ
. I was already a fan. I did this interview at the 4080 offices on a speaker phone. The interview was not seen again until it was republished in the book 
Lyrical Swords Vol. 2: Westside Rebellion
 in 2006. When Jay Z and Nas settled their differences, it was partially reprinted on Allhiphop.com. This is the first time
AB: What were your earliest memories of Hip-Hop? Not much being a part of it- but just the music itself and the culture?
Nas: I remember it just bein’ the fly shit, the new shit. Just niggas, Black people, young Black people, loud music, big speakers, turntables, females, weed, Private Stock, and seeing’ records. Like, if somebody was a big name, you saw he made a record. I mean, it was mad rappers. But when you look at a niggas record – you seen that was some shit! As being a young Black man, you would have never thought to see yourself on some wax. And that tight there, you was the man. You was chillin’. Even if a n***a never knew you, if they see you on record you was the man
AB: So what was the first Hip-Hop album you bought?
Nas: I think it was Run-DMC 
“King of Rock.”
 If it wasn't that, it was LL Cool J’’s 
“Radio.”
 Those were the first ones I bought. The other ones, I stole out my man’s crate
AB: What were the first ones you stole?
Nas: The first one I stole was I think, Mary Jane Girls. I consider that Hip-Hop
AB: I understand you used to break back in the day?
Nas: Yo, that was a long time ago. I'd rather not talk about it. We all did it
AB: I used to do that for a minute. So tell me about your youth. 
What was your relationship like with your father?
Nas: He was just a cool muthafucka. He was different from what I would visualize: a father being when you would look down and watch a [show] like Cosby Show. He was different than that type of shit. But he’s just a cool n***a – 
a straight up and down person
AB: 
And your mother?
Nas: My moms is real strong, real sensitive, real caring and real intelligent
AB: Do you have any business plans?
Nas: 
Ill Will music, dedicated to my man Ill Will. Bless the dead.
 He would probably be spinnin’ for me right now on the turntables or chillin’ with me ‘cause he was my right hand man. But now he’s still here with me, spiritually
AB: We all know a lot of Black men that have lost their lives needlessly. What do you think are the reasons for the havoc coast to coast?
Nas: It’s just that we're naturally born Black and aggressive towards getting what we deserve. We’’re born knowing that something is missing. We're born feeling like we're born in an 
alien nation
. From day one, your moms and what she goes through. I mean just, just, generations. It’s what your parents have already been through. Really, it depends on how your family structure is. If your moms is on dope, and your pops ain't there, you gonna grow up real strong in certain ways and real fucked up in certain ways. But if your moms is there and your pops is there but they are just weak people who didn't know how to guide you …If you're the kind of person who takes things upon yourself, then you're gonna be a different way. You know it’s all kinds of ways we come out. It’s so many of us that are around each other. So much s**t on our minds. We're thinking’ we're tyrants trying to get to the right solution. We're thinking’ about all the different ways of getting it and it’s mad obstacles in our way. It’s mad shit that we don't see in our way that makes us fall. It’s so easy for us to f**k up, especially when you are coming from a poor family
AB: On Main Source’s 
“Live at the BBQ”
 you had a line that said 
“When I was 12 I went to hell for snuffin’ Jesus.”
 I'm not a Christian, but the fact that a man would make a casual remark like that about the murder of an acknowledged Prophet to some and saviour by others- what brings lines like that out?
Nas: When I'm feeling’ up to a point where I’m on some shit where I just don't give a shit ‘bout nobody. ’Cause ain't nothin’ in my pocket. I’m going through some shit, I’ll diss anybody I want to. I'll tell you why. I could break the s**t down for you. Because when a person is that angry, that’s how he feels about everything. That’s how I felt lyrically at the time
AB: Reminds me of Malcolm X, in the movie when he yells to the priest “You tell Jesus to kiss my ass! What has he done for me. “He ain't done nothin’ for me!”
Nas: I kinda felt like how Malcolm X felt. And this was before the movie, I just thought of Malcolm when I said that. You know what I mean? I knew he would be behind me
AB: Are you coming to the West Coast any time soon?
Nas: True indeed. I plan on coming’ out there with the Queens shit, the inner side of Queens material. It’s a lot of punk muthaf**kas that never say Queens and shit
AB: Why do you think that is?
Nas: I don’t know, to tell you the truth. I don't know. It just became like a religion for some rappers not to mention Queens. But I’m from Queensbridge, and I’m just representing’. It’s all about 
the bridge
 with me
AB: Its funny to me because some of my earliers memories are from Queens rappers
Nas: 
B.D.P. put a cease to that shit
AB: Is that what it is? do you think they had an influence on that whole angle?
Nas: 
KRS ONE was so ill.
 He just came out and destroyed shit. A lot of rappers from Queens just couldn’t fuck with him. Or, at the time as just trying to concentrate on their career. You know, getting money or whatever. There wasn’t really a lot of battling rappers accept 
LL Cool J
AB: So what kind of angle were you trying to come on with this album?
Nas: 
I just wanted to speak. I just wanted to be the voice of a nation
AB: 
I saw a quote from a Hip-Hop magazine where you said you wanted to be the first Black President
Nas: Word up!
AB: How do you plan to get there?
Nas: Its’ so many tricks. So much shit. The people, the politicians, the government. The government is ill. They on some old Illmatic shit. They are just like the slave masters but more modern. They have different goals. The world is different now. They just on some new shit. Its about who got game, who’s smart and moves first
AB: When I look at the Declaration of Independence, America is nothing more than an Idea that has never really been put into practice
Nas: True indeed
AB: Like Disneyland. Where everybody is supposed to be happy. 
But it does not exist
Nas: I might have to quote you on that one day. Wise words
AB: Thank you brother. Can America happen? Or do you think America is just a concept?
Nas: As long as they keep living those ideals and shit. and trying to do that, I think yes. ‘Cause America is cool right now as long as you know what you gotta do. Like that nigga Don King will tell you in a minute. H’e s a Black man and he’s paid. So that means you can get that dough. Straight up and down. It's some good here
AB: I was recently reading a book by 
Dennis Kimbro called Think and Grow Rich
. He quotes a guy named S.B. Fuller who says that “Poverty is a state of mind.”I thought it was profound. I wondered if you agreed with that
Nas: Hmmm. Yeah, in ways. In ways
AB: In which ways is it not?
Nas: I mean, poverty is just reality. There is real poverty. You know what I’m saying? I don’t know. That shit is deep
AB: What human being had the most influence on you as a person?
Nas: Malcolm X and 
N.W.A
AB: Stay strong, and [Produced by DJ Premier]
[Intro]
Damn, look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggas just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right
Like I'm a f-, I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfucking gun
I can't believe this shit
Word up, word up
[Verse 1]
I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab me and bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds,
 
been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, living harshly
Beat up and battered
 
they pull me out
I watch as niggas scattered, making me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, finding myself fiending to be fired
A broken safety,
 
niggas place me in shelves
Under beds
 
so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with
 
hollow heads
[Hook] x2
How you like me now, I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds making every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power, I made you buckwild
[Verse 2]
Always I'm in some shit
My abdomen is the clip, the barrel is my dick uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me
I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggas shock me
I see niggas bleeding running from me in fear, stunningly tears
Fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys,
 
for years
I've been used in robberies, giving niggas heart to follow me
Placing peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up tech
 
with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced,
 
hoping one day police would place
Where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murdering, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo, I had some other plans
 
like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand
[Hook] x2
[Verse 3]
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a
 
nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept crying
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year
 
he's rusty, it's clear
He's bout to fall to pieces cause of his murder career
Yo I can hear somebody coming in, open the shelf
His eyes bubbling, he said it was on
I felt his palm troubled him shaking
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was aching
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waiting
My creation was for Blacks to kill Blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally go off, making niggas memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said remember me
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggas is waiting in hell for him
He squeezed harder,
 
I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor
 
his wig split
 
so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggas screaming, niggas running, cops is coming
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me,
 
damn

[John Lennon]
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today
[Rap Verse 1: Nas]
Imagine we could all get along
Won't be long
Til that day comes
Mothers, stop cookin', take off your aprons
Father, stop lookin' at every sports station
Take a second
And think of every poor nation
Making weapons
They can't afford a plate, no proper healthcare
Over here in Section 8, a lot on welfare
Yo, the wealthy laugh, the market crash, economy's bad
How did we change it, newsflash about a power that's dangerous
How do we escape these brainless acts of terror
I'd tell you now, if Jesus ever comes, it'll not be better
Put our hearts in the right place
Humans of all colors
We stand up as one race, I promise you, one day
Imagine that
[John Lennon]
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Living life in peace
[Hook: John Legend]
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
[Rap Verse 2: Pitbull]
America, the
Land of the free
America, the
Land of opportunity
America
What's the point of having a Statue Of Liberty
If you turnin' refugees, back at sea
Music was made to move them
Even the devil he dances
I got a lot of questions
And I'm searching for answers
We taught to believe in religion, but religion's
The reason the 
Twin Towers
 are missin'
Listen
That was the past, but maybe now, you realize
The man above us the only thing
That keeps us alive
We breathe the same air
We bleed the same blood
Imagine our people treated equal, imagine one love (One love)
[John Lennon]
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
[Repeat Hook]

[Produced by Jae Supreme]
[Verse 1]
I'm the nigga walkin with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin
Gimme a Smith-N-Wesson I'll have niggas undressin
I'm rollin with a mob and runnin from the cops
Drive stolen cars and shoot many Glocks
A marijuana addict,
 
if niggas want 
They had it,
 
cause I flip just like a acrobatic
I'm always on the corners rollin up Sess
When I dress it's never nothin less than Guess
So I walk with a bop and my hat turned back
Love commitin sins and my friends sell crack
I got it goin on, my knuckle game is strong
Sip Dom Pérignon and then carry on
Army certifieds, keep a Rent-A-Ride
Strippin mad hoes and kick em to the side
See I'm the type of brother who keeps a four-pounder
Start a lot of shit and shoot at out of towners
At every block party, I try to catch a body
All for props,
 
tell your pops 
 now I'm on the run, but still havin fun
Livin by the Mac, my gear is all black
I keep killin, because I'm ready and I'm willin
And I'm a villian
[Hook]
What?
What?
Wha-a-a-t?
[Verse 2]
I got beef with the President and still lovin it
Trying to make plans to overthrow the government
It won't work cause niggas don't believe enough
They'd rather stand on the corners and receive a cuff
Around they wrist
, 
you don't like the sound of this
Rebel, but my country doesn't want me
They'd rather hunt me, but you'll never catch us all
While you fuckin with the 
 we'll be sticking up the malls
Full of anger, all about danger
Pullin out my banger, stabbin up a stranger
I hear Walkie Talkies in my sleep
And use a whole lot of slang when I speak
Walking with a vest, the projects is where I rest
And the streets keep me stressed
Staring at your face, wait for you to make a sound
That's when I take you down, shoot you up and suit you up
All in black, and put you in a box
A hard rock with a .25 in my socks
Aiming at your temple, so take the diamonds off your hands
I'm buckwild like Billy Bear and Ganz
Prince of pistolers, words are crystal clear
And this you should fear
The maniac keeps killing, I'm known as a outlaw
Cause I'm a villain
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I keep bullets racing out the barrels of a Magnum
Put 'em to sleep and leave the doctors to tag them
An outlaw, although I never wear a 
In every town you see my face is on a poster
Hear so many gunshots my eardrums should pop
Eyesight should stop, from seeing mad niggas drop
To the concrete
, 
I got police putting chalk on the street
And this is done once a week
I'm out to kill, like Navy Seals
I'm crazy ill, and what I can't do my .380 will
I never play with a AK
Because I'm fine with a .9 and if caught I'll do lesser time
Sometimes you gotta plan shit, and understand it
See I'm a bandit whose hand'll itch
Without a gun in it, Nas is runnin it
I stay blunted, I'm the project's most wanted
My voice is like magic
My cassette is the clip and your radio's the Automatic
So when I'm in your town, "duck down"
Or take fire, whatever you desire
But I'm on point you might miss
Never fight this, you'll be sightless when I strike this
So roll the dice, I'm stoppin the bank
It's ill how I got the pen droppin the ink
No one can stop this Apocalypse
On your record player a method layer so run and tell your Mayor
Nas the parlayer, you better say your prayer
I'm the New York City slayer
I play high post and then lay low
Parlé slow
 
and wear horns, not a halo
And keep killin, cause I'm a villain

[Intro: Marsha Amborious (Nas)]
Oooh oooh, oooooooooooooooohhhhhhhh! The struggles of life! (Life!)
Oooh, oooh, oooh, da da da da da da! (Everything I ever wanted)
Oh, oh (Yeah Yeah!) Do do do do do do! (Yeah! My life, so real)
[Verse 1: Nas]
Before I use to dream I could rule the world
Now it's thorough I survived the perils in my fly apparel
Seven forty five appeal, no candy paint no chrome wheels
I Close deals tried to see my face on my own bills
The president here, he's honest and fair
Prayed for the days, when the kins of slaves is honered and shared
January 20th I was there
I'm aware the part I played to get young voters to care
Recession is a blessin in disguise
For a new economy to rise somethin old has to die
I'm still sippin' Rose' PJ's it be's like that
I brung the eighty seven Fila's back
Save collect, 
B.I.G.'S dream came correct
Tryin' to push seven hundreds, they made them yes
I used to think United College Fund was for bums (Nah)
The ghetto advocate for education look what I become
[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Yeah! Here we are!)
[Verse 2: Nas]
I don't say I'm maintainin', that's a lame's language (word)
Poor English, from a wise man I learned patience
Me not distinguished, is like a fiendless Queensbridge
I don't say I'm grindin', cause everything I do is redefining
Cause when you know the streets to the science
Apply it very moderate, 'til your business'll watch you profit
Rap game, NBA to NFL, the kids'll yell, "Will I win? "
The fella ends up in the cell - nonsense
Cause they can grow to be part of the Congress
Be responsive, to these inner-city problems
Behind a tent with a chauffeur, I rep for the culture
Rep for the thugs and STILL see eye to eye with Oprah
I was a dreamer a wisher would hope for
A better life for these kids while I sip on a Mosa
I plan yo, you should watch the black and white's hand, yo
Who's the best? Next to me, they couldn't light a candle
Yep!
[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Arrrrreeeeeeee!)
[Bridge: Marsha Ambrosious (Nas)]
You can be who you wanna, say what you wanna (Marsha!)
Tryna make it better, our sons and our daughters (Yeah!)
Use your mind - make a change
Yes, we can - see a brighter day
Gon' be struggle, gon' be pain
But no excuses to be made
This is the time that we've been waiting foooooooooor!
[Verse 3: Nas]
I done seen it all, I got it on with the weak and strong
There's no relief, it's like the beef keeps keepin on
I can't count the amount I drew heaters on
Cause we was warrin in the Ps', it was Vietnam
Now I got you in arenas, watchin me perform
The songs rappin 'bout them same beefs and the street I'm from
Thankful, for the art form I'm eatin from
I never see no losses, I only see we won - yeah
[Hook: Marsha Ambrosious {Nas}]
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (I Ruled the world)
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)
Before I use to dream I ruled the world
{I use to have to imagine, now I can actually have it}
So here I am, to rule the world, world
But now you used to dream you ruled the world
(Now, you, use, to, dream, you, ruled, the, world!)
{I use to dream} (Oh we come so far!)
So here we are, are, are, are (Here we are this day!)

[Jennifer Lopez & (Nas)]
Oh yes (Uh, this for you girl)
[Nas]
Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo hand
All I know, when Nas was yo man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'
[Jennifer Lopez]
Money, cars for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me "This ain't right"
Don't you know, it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Cause I love you I just got to say
[Hook]
I used to say I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And I know inside that I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
I said I didn't do it but I did it (Yes I did)
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright (Gonna be alright)
[Jennifer Lopez]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Cause I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize, I can't change you
[Hook]
[Jennifer Lopez & {Nas}]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay (Days I want to stay)
But leaving you is what I need to do (Need to do)
To be OK (I need to be OK)
I never thought it would be true (Would be true)
Be leaving without you (Leaving without you) {Huh, this life is crazy}
So now it's time for me to make that move
[Nas with J.Lo ad-libs]
Huh check it
Yo nobody understands me, I'm dealin' with pressure
My peoples is locked in a jail cell with no bail stressin'
Guess it's the life of a kingpin
Rap Stephen King, rap bling
Like neon lights, we gon' be alright
But it's like, you feelin' me lesser
Claim I'm actin' like a retard, right?
Me and my boys, we start fights, when will I mature
You scream I'm in the streets all night
Or where was I at, ya found light brown hairs on my hat
I'm slow caught
[Hook]

[Intro: DJ Khaled]
The season has returned
DJ KHALED!
We global now, we global
We international now, international
Nasir!
[Verse 1: Nas]
Money fall out the sky when I speak
Got a valet, can't leave mine out in these streets
Can't carpool, the crew is too deep
Why tuck it all in? The jewels are too sweet
You should ball if you could
I be diggin in my pockets, 
it ain't trickin if you got it
And since a nigga from the projects
Champagne out of a can would be the fly shit
And I'm a history maker, hood motivational speaker
Rap Led Zeppelin, best-dressed list
Show you how to bubble off of large investments
Ya heard me, and this journey, I'm the journalist
Line around the block to hear the words of the herbalist
Send ya girl to the Dominicans to perm her shit
Tell her tonight, we gonna see Nas return to his murder shit
[Hook: Nas] (DJ Khaled)
It's still Nasty, raw in the flesh
God's Son, never gone, never left
King, I played every card in the deck
The whole world waitin for what I'mma do next
And y'all already know where I came from
Queensbridge repper since day one
Nigga, I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Come on!)
I'm on! (Nasir!)
Come on!
[Hook: Cool]
Out of the shadows, into the light
I have the power to take back what's mine
(Can't hide, can't hide)
We have the power
(Alive, it's so fine to be alive)
We are the light
[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm God's hit man
, Chopard wristband
New York crown jewel, no if-and's
, top five
I'm the one, two, three, four and the fifth man
Smoke a hookah in Istanbul, I'm quicksand
I'm five mics
, five points of light
Hit the stage like a meteorite
They wanna all hear Ether tonight, but we ain't beefin tonight
That's history
, so now when you mention me
Say I'm a mystery like six degrees
Or the seven hills of Sicily, I need a vasectomy
They resurrected me but nothin is left for me
Just when you thought you'd seen the best of me
I take it a notch higher, yeah
Sip more wine than a sommelier
Get around town in a private Lear
And by sun down, I'm up out of here
[Hook]
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Power, paper, palace is so high
Lookin over skyscrapers, wildin out in Dubai
Do I look like I never seen the better things?
Emerald ring, I chase cheddar mean
Pockets on swole since eighteen years old
Gettin my dough, cigars are hand-rolled
From Guantanamo, Gallardos, the car shows
The Narcos, Gestapos, Optimos
Cause I love the dough more than you know
Still ain't reached the pinnacle
Braveheart general since nine-fo'
Got the belt to show, certified classic
Nine-six, Street Dreams was blastin
And no way they wanna hire assassins
They still harassin, I'm so platinum, it's natural
And nigga is my acronym, lights, camera, actionin
[Hook]
[Hook]
[Nas]
Nigga, I'm on!
I'm on!
Come on!
[Outro: DJ Khaled]
We global now, we global
We international now, international
Nasir!

[Verse 1: Nas]
Circumstances are like my first fight I lost
It was swinging, my arms bugging, adrenaline pumping
Oh shit, this little nigga's thugging
I mean, I was thirteen, I was nursing a knot on my face
But chose another time and a place
That I would avenge my last fight cuz the same shit
Ain't gonna happen that just happened last night
Knuckle game changed quicker than lightning
Hit 'em or slice 'em
Either stick 'em or blast pipes, it's the fastlife
I try to give another nigga advice, shoot dice
Do plenty of shit cause this life, how many you get?
How many niggas do you know get two?
Besides a nigga who snitch to skip a life-bid
, 
be one a' your crew
I don't respect killers, I respect O.G. knowledge
Codes of the streets got new rules, but no guidance
Lessons, detrimental to a young disciple
Focus, take care of your brothers, niggas do as I do
Keep your enemies close, where they can see you
It's not your enemy who get you
It's always your own people (x5)
[Hook: Tanya Herron]
Mass confusion, in my head
Killing me, driving me mad
Got me wondering, can I trust my friends?
Cuz they stick me in my back every chance they get
Am I paranoid? and if that's the case
Is it curable? Can you help me find my place?
I can't handle this, I'm losing it
With a loose grip I'm hanging on to emptiness
Help your brother, save him from the
Evil demons in between us, came between us
[Verse 2: Scarface]
I know you hate me, don't you
I bet you sit and wish my time never came
You probably rather see me die in the game
You probably rather see me die in a plane
Well ya'll see me up on top of my dough
I get my money shit changed
And niggas start looking at me different than this
And downplay the real nigga shit to get with a bitch
But I'mma tell a motherfucker like this
You only good as what you come up against
Nigga you get what you get
Sure the grass is greener on the other side of the fence
But any attempts and you gonna need the guy in the trench
I'ma starter while you riding the bench
You saying you a player, well I'm the one designing your prints
Something to go by, to let these niggas know I
Don't believe in letting shit slide, nigga gonna die
Best friends since high school seniors
Where the homeboys is meaner, but let the bullshit come between us
[Hook: Tanya Herron]
[Outro: Scarface]
Ay this um...
This song right here dedicated to the homie Curtis Davis
We love you home, Big Mello, RIP

[VERSE 1 NAS]
Two steps away from death
A vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession
They was checking the Rover
Inspecting the Tattoos
On my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six
Coffin holders
Or I'm
Sitting with goons in the visiting rooms
Flip it I could have been you
Behind state walls biddin'
These are the things that a G pray for
Acquit us
A little stash in the safe or
Little Shorty to wait for him
Or a Shorty to take the weight for him
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw Gods face
On the design in my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see Him every day ya'll
In a bus or the train or
The billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for Him
Have faith for Him
No matter what His name's called
Seen!

[VERSE 2 JR. GONG]
Can you think of a color that you never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you never been?
Well is many are called
But them never deemed
Worthy for the cause
Cause them never clean
Help who help themselves
Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah Jah
Like a Cherubim
Keep we strong through the winter
Like an Evergreen
And all of us are more connected
Than it ever seemed
All things are related
And creation is a package
Generate together
And we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage?
Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor stop we through the passage
Jah did make a promise
God is always honest
Always keeps his word
Yow nuh care what the plan is
Don't be astonished
Stumbling blocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, Woah!

[VERSE 3 NAS]
Some ask me if I feel
That Zion is surreal
And in my songs
Do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb
That's under these chrome wheels
My homies is the only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers
Have become more weird
As if they were superior
And fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature
I hold mirrors up
Give combinations of pain, joy, fear and love
Through my perspective
I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition
Getting high with my bredrin
Then I ask him why is Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons and suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
Its like its been exchanged for this penicillin
Seen
[Hook 4 x2 STEPHEN MARLEY]

[Kelis (Nas)]
You see, it's this thing (Kelis)
I like being single (ha ha)
Outside....in my mind (Get +Tasty+)
I liked the way we were (Cookies - +Tasty+)
(+Tasty+, yeah, let's go)
[verse 1 - Kelis]
He was next to me (come closer)
Our flight was s'posed to leave around 2:53
All I wanted to see
Is what would he do if I dropped down to my knees
I wanna play a game
If someone come in, it don't matter, just the same (I like it)
Try something fun with me
Let's take our clothes off all over the balcony
[Hook - Kelis (Nas)]
Let's get it on In Public
Just let it go, I promise that you'll love it
Oh Daddy, don't you wanna be my soldier? (yeah)
Ooo-oooh, let's get it on In Public, oooh
[Verse 2 - Kelis]
Don't try to run from me
I'll make your toes curl up and make your body scream
Come take a walk with me
We can do it over there by all the trees
Drive this car real fast
I'll lay my head and I'll make your body blast
Oww!
[Hook]
[Kelis] (Nas)
Let's make a movie baby (Sit over there)
Can we get away with it? (Open your legs)
I'll be an animal (yeah)
All lights on (I wanna see you)
I like it when we do it to this song (You like that)
Let's make a movie baby
Can we get away with it? (I'll be directing, heh)
So nasty
All lights on (I like to see)
I like it when we do it to this song (Yeah, yeah yeah)
Yeah? Talk to me
[Verse 3 - Nas (Kelis)]
The pussy or the mouth? 
That is the question (Okay) like Shakespeare
But my erection is the case here (yeah)
I ain't got time to drive you all the way home
But instead I can slide you to a club bathroom (Okay)
Or a restaurant's men's room
Then I can zoom in your womb
We both get what we want (Okay), then we can assume
To doing what we was, smokin' that bud and chillin'
But first I got it up, before anything, you willing?
To win it, it's animal behaviour
La chic, la freak-out, with a sexy beast ma (yeah?), who slays ya
This is for the mature who love the natural love-
-making outdoors on the hood of your car (Ohh, yeah)
Nas is good at it all when it comes to givin' it ?war?
Do I have to convince you now?
We don't need hotel keys
We jump in the trunk and stain everything upside ya G-string
[Hook] *with Nas ad-libs*
Repeat 2x
[Nas (Kelis)]
*Kelis moans*
So nasty, girl
If they gon' see us, cool, they gon' see us (haha)

Peace, how are you?
I ain't mean to be late
It was my night to watch my little girl
It's chilly out here
What happened? You crying?
Y'all got into it again huh?
See you gotta let them know from the jump
I don't care who they are, or who they're with
Yeah I know they know we're talking
Shh, why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us
Could love each other
Come on, stop crying now
Eh, there's something I gotta tell you
I heard they're watching you
Yeah, they're watching, they're watching me too
But there ain't no reason to get low
I'm proud, I'm here
You know I'mma stand up for you, no matter what
And I know you'll stand up for me
I don't have no doubts about you being true to me
The world is ours
But right now it feels like the whole world is against us
So study, be strong, don't cry no more
*Immediately follows A Message To The Feds, Sincerely, We The People*

[Nas]
Spit at the world
My lyrics, I could spit at your girl
Spit when I hurl, spit on the Dutch and finish the twirl
Spit facts, spit on wax my whole lifetime
Spit on my watch, make the ice shine
Spit trife lines, .44 spit slugs out
Ready to thug out at the clubhouse
Chickens who lickin' or spit a nut out
My name within itself is a language that bring you wealth
Careful, comin' at me is like hangin' yourself at a.....
I know you thought I'd be locked up
Dead by now, shot up, full of lead by now
Got up wit' JD doh', crazy dough
Queens with the So So Def, A-T-L's best (yeah I know)
Every ride up the 9-5, fly friendly skies
Thug passion for J Doves, Henneys for Nas
Then we mix that shit, tip that shit
Pass it around, hook the hood, everybody get wit' it
[Hook]
[Nas]
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
Cause Queens Bridge is in the house
This is Nas Escobar and I turns it out
[JD]
Through thick and thin, from beginning to the end
Never do I lose, all I do is win
Cause Collin Park is in the house
They call me Don Chi Chi and I turns it out
[JD]
I'm sumpin' y'all dread like locks, get bread by the flocks
Bitches love me and I'm duggy from the head to the socks
Too much to handle, here da man of the year
Hit rooms and light'em up like a chandelier
From C-P to the Bridge, y'all know what it is
Been gettin' money like this since I was a kid
I'm in the corner with bitches and buckets of Cris
Pourin' at the most goin'est nigga wit' shit that showin' it
Now look at my ice, look at your ice, DAMN
Look at my life, look at your life, DAMN
See, I got niggas wantin' to drop me, top me, stop me
Copy Chi to the T cause I'm nice in the 3 black same color AMG's
T.V's, front and back pack with nuttin' but ladies
You can look up or down, right or left
But all you gon' hear and see is So So Def
[Hook, JD then Nas]
Touch the whole global with cold vocals and dark words
Vocal cords translate what my drunk heart slurs
Chest clogged up with sparked up herb, I feel faint
Tryin' to hold myself together, coulda spilt my own drink
All I hear is beats bumpin', I'm seein' in doubles
Last thing I need to happen is to be in a scuffle
Where my dogs at? These ain't my niggas Allah
Help the guard, forgot my niggas took some girls to the car
Tryin' to make it through the crowd, which way is out?
Which way is around? These grimy motherfucker's pointin' me out
I wish I had the drink, but then I'm too intoxed to aim and put the clip in
It's like the floor's wet and every step is like I'm slippin'
And yo, I can't lose a step, I feel my enemies followin'
All I got as a weapon is this Hennessee bottle
I'm talkin' to myself, my peoples should be stickin' with me
Somebody grabbed me up, "Yo Nas, come take this picture wit' me"
My ice strillon, I'm feelin' my arm
Thought my Roley was gone, now I wanna swing but I'm calm
Still got that, DJ musta threw on another hot track
Think it was this one here, bounce to that
Too much Thug Passion and smokin'
Made it outside, mouth wide, vomittin', gaggin' and chokin'
From behind, niggas plottin' and scopin'
Everything was blurry at first, but now shit is movin' in slow motion
I saw my niggas pull up, Perelli's they skidded
They open the car door and toss-ed me in it
My cats tried to rob me, the crowd was rowdy
But one thing's for sure, So So Def know how to party
[Backdrop]
All night long {'til when?}
Til the early morn (it don't stop)
And uh (it don't quit)
And uh (So So Def with the dope shit, bitch!)

[Intro: Notorious B.I.G.]
Wooo! There's gonna be a lot of punchin in this motherfucker
Y'all better be swift with that punch button Jack
Biggie.. Biggie..
[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce
And wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G
I had to get P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court
For an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, cause man
[Chorus: K-Ci & JoJo]
Come and run with me .. I really wanna show you
How I run the streets .. I really wanna show you
How I'm clockin G's .. I really wanna show you
Come and run with me .. I really wanna show you
[Verse 2: Notorious B.I.G.]
I had the master plan
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs
And when he start to bust he like to ask, "Who's next?"
I got my honey on the Amtrak
With the crack in the crack of her ass
Two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be Lieutenant
Bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin black
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;
In the everyday struggle
[Chorus]
[Hook: Notorious B.I.G.]
I'm seeing body after body and our mayor Guiliani
Ain't tryin to see no black
Man turn to John Gotti
[Verse 3: Nas]
Guns and diamonds
Bitches put they tongues where the sun ain't shinin
Take ki's til they spot us, snakes flee with consignment
This kid he got his crib raided, police found grams
They locked up, his whole fam; moms sister his old man
Nigga bailed his moms out, then he told on his man
Now they home, actin like nuttin wrong, hustlin again
He tried to be the next Frank White, and Escobar
Pickin up coke a fiend holds it in a seperate car
Cooks it up til it's bright white, cut it tight right
Then he slings it to the fiends, lookin like Fright Night
Coppin the motorbikes, the scooters, countin dough on computers
High technology dealers, to the users and losers
Half-leg DiDi, try to swap drug for TV's
Stores run out of baking soda from BK to QB
My niggas die for the cause, .45 on the drawer
City laws made by Big Nas and Biggie Smalls
Bitches, holdin my weight in they titties and drawers
My bitches out of state get bust while they pushin my cars
Callin me up, callin me baller, call for they cut
Pretty hoes bring me my cash, swallow all of this nut
Seats on the Bent' stay nasty, push the dash
For the stash box is where the cash be; watchin for task force
Cause I know they comin but I'm reachin my goal
Fuck bummin, I'm makin sure I leave this whole game wit somethin
Crib in West Palms for my dime, crib for my moms
Ridiculous, you lookin at the next Nicholas Barnes, baby
[Chorus (repeat to fade)]

[Produced by Large Professor]
[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian,
 
half-man, half-amazing
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
[Verse 2]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop,
 
place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille,
 
it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats,
 
slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
[Verse 3]
This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang,
 
begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops,
 
giving mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple,
 
I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot,
 
vocals'll squeeze Glocks
MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fail
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell

[Intro:]
Take it to the bridge
To the motherfuckin' bridge
Queensbridge in the motherfucker
[Hook:] x3
It Ain't Hard to Tell
[Verse 1:]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up

School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill

Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook:] x3
[Verse 2:]
What's a beat if the rap don't click
I spit rhymes like I'm sick, dying loss in a pit
The only way I can escape is by vocals
Verbalize a strife
Stabbin' ears like a knife hood like
The Prophet of the gutter
Lyrics are silk mega butter
I flow never stutter
Clever poetic brothers on a mission
Dissin' all who perps the fraud
Scrams listen, (and) do what the experts record
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
Well I be packin' like a rasta in a weed spot
Hittin' your hearts like a hollow tip
Verbally illin' minds manipulated
My raps a nickel-plated
I illustrate it, X-rated, then move out
Nas the parlayer takes you on a new route
It's suicide poetry released from a cell
With immense clientele, I excel
It ain't hard to tell
[Hook:] x3
[Verse 3:]
Now, I'm blessed with the finesse to express like Shakespeare
The blocks "Cape Fear" drop metaphors when the breaks clears
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing

My poetry's deep I never fail
Nas' raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell
[Outro Scratches]
The type of lyrical terrorism I present

[Hook:]
It ain't hard to tell
(Nasty)
(Nasty)
(Nasty)
[Verse 1:]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathing a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like the Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket lining
Hit the Earth like a comet – invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazing
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook:] x2
[Verse 2:]
The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jewel, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille, it ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it like Iron Sheik
Jam like a Tec with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magnetize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook:] x2
[Verse 3:]
This rhythmatic explosion is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggas is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep, well let me try again
Wisdom be leaking out my grapefruit, troop
I dominate break loops, giving mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packing like a Rasta in the weed spot, vocals'll squeeze Glocks
MC's eavesdrop though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fail
Nas's raps should be locked in a cell, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook:] x2
[Outro:] x5

[Intro]
Yeah.. yeah.. [hahahaha] uh-huh, yeah yeah
[HAH hahahaha] Huh yo, you know it
Infamous ninety-nine (infamous ninety-nine)
[Hahahaha] Infamous two thousand
(Ain't nuttin but thugs over here baby)
[AHHH hahahaha].. [hahaha].. [HAH haha]
[Havoc]
Yo... straight thugs on this side - it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin they last breath
Read your last rites - God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit - takin a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin my will
 - you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin your ice, appraisin it like the Diamond District Jeweler
With they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted; or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress
It's the world that I live in, Q.B. made me
A moms that loved me and a pops that raised me
Chorus: Nas {singing to the chorus of Brandy's "The Boy is Mine"}
Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. cause we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine
[Prodigy]
I got the style of a still-born child, I'm ill
If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well
(Very very) 
The streets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
So when they start shootin, we don't stop the music
Keep it moving that's how we do it (c'mon, c'mon Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins,
 you still crawlin
(Still crawlin) Apply street rules to the office, high performance
Rap author, made millions off of - melodic, 
hypnotic productions
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions
(You feel me? You feel me?)
You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggas to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music
(Don't get no realer than this!)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (What?)
Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggas can't touch us
Chorus
[Nas Escobar]
Silk shirts on my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I'll front like my doo doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin, gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
Cause today goes either way - we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, NexTel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters
Wake up, guns under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
NAStradamus, last one to blast one when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat
, comin and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes
You don't need a suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket
Chorus
[Nas]
The, life, is, mine (repeat 3X)
Ill Will..
You need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck
What y'all niggas want.. we don't give a fuck
Thug, life, is, mine
Y'all need to give it up.. we don't give a fuck..
What y'all niggas want.. thug, life, is, mine

[Intro: Nas]
Uh huh, a love story, but not your ordinary love story
Not hardly, you heard
Get into this shit right here, check this shit out
You know, check it
(Chorus: Lauryn Hill) X2
As we turn the corner, I count down his name
I felt so ashamed, when it wasn't you
[Nas]
Companions, commitments, relationships
They can be so nice in days picnics, advance slow nights
You start to miss it all when you got no wife
Seeing couples, walking, holding each others hands, talking
Like everything around them don't exist
And yo they stop before crossing the street so they can kiss
That remind me, my love for this 'lil mami
A slim body from Saudi Arabia probably (uh, huh)
We met five day into her stay, a thirty day visit
Her second time in the USA
But my first time to gaze at her
And wave at her was at KNICKS game
Islamic name hard to spit game
My thug look made nervous, her Secret Service
The floor seats next to Spike Lee, I had to purchase
Later we met on 
Tavern on the Green
 and after we dined
I said "I got to have you just one time", she said
(Chorus: Lauryn Hill) X2
[Nas]
Seduced her fast, surprised me, laying beside me
Rolling in my satin sheets, flexible body
Hair, black and long, Indian skin completion
Eyes, nose and lips resemble the Egyptian
It's against rules to make conversation, with anybody new
Which was strange in our situation, that admired her more
Everyday I gave her a tour
Of New York streets, the parts that remained hard-core
It was coming to the day when she had to depart
When she left I felt the butcher knife stabbing my heart
Without a number to dial, continent near by the Nile she reside at
She said she would write
, 
so she could fly back
Private airplanes, been a year, letters never came
In the short time we were together it never rained
Just sun shine when our tongues climbed
Each others body, wish I can see you one time, cause now
(Chorus: Lauryn Hill) X2

Nas - It Was Written

When you're chillin' on the corner with your thugs

Yo say my name!
When your girl don't call you when you beep her
And you hit it and her thing feel deeper
Say my name!
Pull on her hair, spankin' her rear
While I'm in 'em bitches all I wanna hear is you say my name
Squeeze my gats beef is done
Police come you know the game

Dipped out crazy, Timbs chicken and gravy
Q.B., Dupri baby
1 - [JD] (Monica)
When it comes to the clubs packed, Cristal flowin'
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to homes plushed out chrome stuck out in traffic
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to a neck full of glow
And a check full of O's, you know
(I've got to have it)
When it comes to my honeys in the strip club
Sumpin' on dubs in the middle of the block
Like what? Say my name!
(I've got to have it)
[Monica]
Gotta have my tied up Iceberg Gucci Rolley
Bezzled up, bezzled up
Gotta have me a double O
With a six in the front
And a bump-bump in the truck
Gotta have me an escalade
My house is laid
A man that keeps my bills paid
My records play every day
What can I say?
I've got to have it
Repeat 1
[JD]
When you see a black do-rag through the tint
Of a black Bent going too fast
Say my name
When you talk about longevity
And niggas who know how to keep gettin' that cash
Say my name
When you're sick of your songs
Sittin' on the right
And wanna know what the top feel like
Say my name
If you wanna know what being hot feel like
And shuttin' down the spot feel like
Say my name!
JD from the home where the bowls get thrown
And the dough get gone real quick like
Keep niggas sick like 40 karats and a chain
Foolish ain't it?
Say my name!
Everything you did I've done did double
If you hate to see flash then your ass is in trouble
Scram now and don't look back
Cause until I die it's like that
Repeat 1
[Monica]
I've got to have it..

[Nas]
Million dollar homes platinums filled with alot of stones
Bitches on, every new nigga dick who rich
If the street could speak the sidewalk could talk
Everybody business be heard so I prefer
To blueprint, every plan among fam clear
Don't wanna risk a billion dollar plan the walls have ears
Meet at aquariums, me and the team cause I'm preparin 'em
For everythin I seen, who's the most feard and why they scared of 'em
Well first, we need to know who we kill first
Or how to know a whole from the Earth
YO they come in all shapes; skinny and tall
Easy to fall for the cake, they throwin they walk
Most niggas wanna shine when it ain't they time
Comin up with styles mimickin mine
My infinite mind, has no beginin or end
Take out the ink replace the blood of my pen
Thugin again
[Horse]
I'm pointed all time regulatin is a must
Adjust, your hustler state of mind for you blow up
Succes, wins along this hatred and envy
The games people play when your pockets lookin empty
The dime drop 'em, would he smoke or playin poker
He gambles with his life and his cards are gettin shorter
The young and reckless, pack gats inside they vests
I'm 22 to oo-ups, seein who the freshest
I guessed this, must my time to exhale
I've been waitin so damn long that this rap shit is stale
Make it happen, in these streets kids is clappin
Fuck this rappin, seein cheese hustlin crackin
This formal drive seat recline, big wheelie man
Doin scams for the rich and if it runs in my fam
Cross roads, cross breeds, cross over weak mc's
Horse man will always shine, never waste my time
[E Money Bags]
Crime relation got my niggas time facin in the line pacin the yard
All the gods this one for y'all
I never forget it, three times a week on the visit
Just tryin to hold my head until I see the death of these snitches
I know some real ones on the run keepin touch with they bitches
And you can feel what I'm sayin, I suggest that you listen
A victim of circumstance the doe took me
A circle plan design by devious minds to worship custom vans
TV's with fuckin plans keepin them chicken cluckin him
See me I'm buckin men, this life we stuck within
I know the way out theres light at the end of the tunnel
Fray out if I have to, in a heart beat to clap you, a lap to
Another chapter had to adapta
This way of life in your paw, make sure you spray it right
I know the game found my destiny, its best that we part
Before I act like sex me god, bust off severely
Make all my thugs feel me
For the lost crews that make they news yearly
[Nas]
Jump on it, most of my days spent high
My niggas in the cage get by
Writin letters collect calls and V.I.'s
GED's, lock down earnin college degrees
OG's who put us up on more G
How what if I would of stayed school for another grade
What I woulda knew would of got me more paid
But I ain't mad, can't complain blew like NASA
But what I would of learned mighta got me here faster
Cold days in the back of the train
Passengers faces reveal laughter, while some show pain
Blind man come and ask for some change
Now I'm in the Range or airplane, it ain't a fair game
How I end up, Benz truck with my ends up
To prove city housin, wheres plenty wildin
But 
there's many thousands of us prepared to do whatever
The higher power ask of us, flesh to ashes
To dust so the whole world hear us
, don't you want it nigga?
[Hook: Nas]
Want it baby, I want it baby
Don't go on it, your up on it baby
Jump on it, jump on it, I want it baby
You want it baby, I want it baby
Jump on it

[Hook]
I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor,

I wanna talk to the mayor, to the governor, to the motherfuckin' president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherfuckin' congressman

Young girl hit by policeman

The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now
Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggas play with 
PlayStations

On Mars plottin civilizations
Dissin us discriminatin different races
Tax payers pay for more jail for Black Latin faces
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard damn
Niggas gotta go create his own job
Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard
Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved
Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive
Swing a mack to be live cart ack to get high
It's the ghetto life yea I celebrate it I live it
And all I got is what you left me with I'mma get it
And y'all combinin' all the countries we goin' do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang
It ain't a black and white thing
It's to make the change, citizens of a higher plane
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
What y'all waitin for the world to blow up
Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless
Let y'all niggas bang my shit 
before Saddam hits
Let 
Nastradamus
 tell us what time it is
They try to buy us with doe
Fake black leaders of puppets always talking bout the city budget
The news got it all confused lyin to the public
They eyes watchin stay wise move above it
Water floods predicted, hurricanes, twisters
Its all signs of the Armageddon, three sixes
People reverse the system, politics verse religion
Holy war, muslim verse christians
Niggas in high places, they don't got the balls for this
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us
Mr. President I assume it was negligence
The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this
[Hook]
[Outro]
Can I talk to you Mr. President
Niggas tryin to get with the computers
We ain't John Henry
Banging down fuckin'..? fighting against the machines
We want to be Part of the establishment nigga
That's what we are steppin up for

This shit is real
Total Package in this nigga

Ill Will nigga
Mr. President wanna keep us from establishment
Niggas are american baby
American Made

Nas:
Yo A yo A yo A yo
I thank a dead homey
Incarcerated penpal I got the feds on me
A constipated mental'
Always rains in the ghetto it's 
pain
 in the ghetto
Caskets do u believe 
in angels or devils?
Welfare it's dark and there's no help here
Killer cops shooting 
black kids to instill fear
But we still here not afraid cracks is made stacks get made
A "G" will get you gats sprayed
At my man's funeral it's like nobody cares
The police get shot the mayor and everybody there
Graffiti on the lobby stairs, kids with knotty heads is greedy
Soldiers small faces painted on the walls
I was born 
to ball
Rings you can't afford name a clothes line I done worn it before
Dictate the naked soul of Nas, henny four fives
Ho's with thick thighs be the wives 
of rich guys
Never trust a bitch cuz a bitch lies
Enemys close cuz friends switch 
sides when shit gets live
Dealin' with a lot of pressure I'm in too deep
Life of a thug born and 
raised in the streets
Chorus:
Nature: You want war I'mma give u war
Nas: I'm in too deep
Nature: You want peace I'mma give u peace
Nas: Raised in the streets
Nature: You want love I'mma show u love
Nas: Life of a thug
Nature: There's no love for me in these streets
Nas: I'm in too deep
Nature: It's just hustlers in the streets
Nas: Raised in the streets
Nature:
Yo A yo
When you in too deep you better climb out and find out
Are you the one they looking at cuz when you looking back
It's your time to fear if the drama's severe
I see scars starting off at the side of they're ear
Ending up by the jaw of the throat another law broke
I try to patch it white kids is buying acid
Closing down spots popping a knot
Heard the foremores use binoculars watchin the blocks
Calling phantom on the tape
I'm the phantom of the wax
Now meat the man behind the music examing the facts
I use it, to my advantage do this shit everyday
Like sneaking gats up in Great A
Six Flags, catch me getting on the popular rides
If a nigga violate he getting popped on the line
Small hot ones locked in the spines
Transformed roll out pass it off to my man no doubt
I keep six disguises six shirts in the trunk
Imagin it gets six times worse when I'm drunk
Prepare for death first of the month
Open your eyes, it's right here in front of you open your eyes
I can't explain it cuz it's not normal, is niggas loyal
I talk about life and live it for you this shit is soil
Like the dirt that I walk on you talk on
Used to have love for ya know it's all gone all gone
Chorus:
Nature: You want war I'mma give u war
Nas: I'm in too deep
Nature: You want peace I'mma give u peace
Nas: Raised in the streets
Nature: You want love I'mma show u love
Nas: Life of a thug
Nature: There's no love for me in these streets
Nas: I'm in too deep
Nature: It's just hustlers in the streets
Nas: Raised in the streets

[Nas] Yo, Yo
[Puffy] Gansta, Gansta
[Nas] Gansta Yo
[Puffy] That's Right
[Nas] Journey Through the life of some real niggas
[Puffy] Some real niggas, You'll never see what I've seen
[Puffy]
When I sleep I dream of bodies in streams of blood
Naked bitches, dead nigga's ghost, Feds with toast
Knockin' my door down sweat poor down my body
Roast from the heat so I soak my sheets
Wake up shiverin', pull my ho close to me, she sexy
Every night is different pussy since my girl left me
And I tried to make her stay with me, but I stay busy
And her friends are cut-throats, they deep throat to lay with me
I reminisce how I miss a stare in this space
Resort to the lips of a stripper, sprayin' their face
Lampin' in a mansion, home alone
I hear footsteps, shit I kicks just not lyrics
I hold a fifth, wonderin' if ten shots can stop spirits
If nigga's try to rob me then I won't hear it
Cause it's different from the streets, I'm missin' my hood now
Missin' all the blocks cuz I'm surrounded by woods now
It's supposed to be good now
It's like I'm walkin' tight rope and can't look down
Fire below me
Now the fantasies I have for women are unholy
Success, thousand dollar bottles impress
Models with fat ass and big breasts
Floor seats, Knicks vs. Nets, private jets
Millionaire heir to Antigua, with Ananda, the MTV diva
Nas, how do we survive all this mess? (I didn't survive)
East vs. West the rap game
 where words became flesh
A whole pound of herb won't desolve my stress
Still I ride to the death, love hip-hop
Cause Afrikabababa was def, a lot of respect
Feel Me? Fuck to the rock Sean John jury
I got the same hands of crap platinum and the crap pyramids
Write about the black experience, sell it to Marimax
Tell me if you feelin' that
1 - [Lil' Kim & Joe Hooker]
Take a journey through the life of these real niggas
The things that they seen it would thrill niggas
If you've seen what they've seen, you would wonder
Through the rain and the pain and the thunder
By the time that you realized that it's goin' down
You may find yourself going underground
When they see that this life is upon us
We would see that there's no one that we can trust
[Beanie Sigel]
You can never see what I see, motherfucker
Beanie Sigel, the realest nigga from the streets was taught
Stay cased up nigga, stay deep in court
Reminiscin' on that cold cell, deep in thought
Gettin' skinny, couldn't eat, cause the meat was poor
Ya'll niggas couldn't live my life, I've been through it
Streached up in hospital beds, fed fluid
Two bullets hit my leg, one passed through it
Saw the blood and the hole in my calf, looked through it
My life's no joke, I don' played dice with soap
Upstate the case niggas slice your throat
Wear your boxers in the shower when you gaurd your soap
I done seen the biggest nigga's in the yard get broke
I done took blocks through war, took blocks for fall
Took blocks to Wall for box of raw
What you think 33 in the Glock is for?
Black fatigues, skullies and binoculars
C4, block your doors, nigga's can't stop this war
I show you faggots what this Swatz' is for
Hidding spots in the door for the Glocks is for
Read the papers, '94 I took the cops to war
Half of ya'll niggas livin' a lie
Only reason you switchin' up your droid is cause you keep gettin' robbed
I looked that nigga in the eyes before I send him to God
Beanie Sigel, desert eagle, the realest nigga alive
Repeat 1
[Nas]
Aiyo, Aiyo, Gansta, Gansta
The Bible has words that Christ wrote, evil men sacrifice goats
I speak all my life under oath
Since a kid, troublesome
Thrownin' shit at little girls jump ropes
Bustin' B-B Guns at stray cats, that was way back
Watched it die, covered in flies
Then I picked up a stick, try to dig in it's eyes
Makin' dirt pies, na, being buggy-eyed shit
And every other nigga that rap, sound like my shit
I wear chrome 45's with ice on the grip
I don't shoot it, I roll with killers and criminals
With heroin habits they picked up from the penile
They let you have it, all I do is give them a smile
Lifestlyes of the realest, you ain't ruthless you bitch
I got a pine box just your size, I know it'll fit
Your whole life's a mistake, stop holdin' the pen
Kill yourself, come back as a man over again
Cause in this lifetime I'm reignin', slay men
Leave your whole body cold
Your nails grow long, you get gray skin
May this nigga rest in peace, Amen
I run with brave men, straight out the housin', we wildin'
Names engraved in the pavement
Brick building, grown ladies jump off the roof
Nigga get paged, then murdered at the phonebooth
New York streets made me nigga, it's crazy nigga
Repeat 1

[Nas]
Yeah
It's like a jungle
Makes me wonder
It's like a jungle
[Olu Dara]
JUNGLE!!
[Nas]
Yo, I have to look out
Everywhere I go
I have to turn around
Watch my back, watch my front
That's what it's all about
It's a jungle of the mind
There's a jungle when you hang
Where they bang
The world's so big yet so small
It's one block
Many die mentally before they reach what they wanted
I choose to get blunted
And cruise the One Hundred Twenty Fifth street
Music loud as hell in my jeep
Eyes meet people, strangers
Not thinkin' of danger
Amongst my people
Some I see through
But one guy stares
Maybe he thinks he knows me
Or maybe he's crazy
Killer, baller, dealer
Something he has he wants to show me
But I'm at this red light
Is it me or is he looking dead right
In my face?
As I pull the strap that I keep
Underneath the seat
Just in time
I was able to fled the scene
And leave him standing there
With his hands in the air
See, my life is green
Harlem to Queens
Triborough bridge packed with cars
Trucks, vans and cabs
They got this new E-ZPass Thing
Computer, taking over the cash thing
So as I drive home
I roll my window up
And my endo up in the same motion
See life is so full of surprises
And as I paid my toll
I drove to see my man
"What up kid, Don, brova?
Whats the deal?"
He said
"Everything's easy bro'er man
It's all real"
I said
"But what happened earlier
Why everybody outside?"
He said like
"Blue suits came runnin' through
And took thirty brothas for a ride
Yo, right after you left the Ave"
Yo, the same thing that's been going on
Since I was young in the past
Still goes on, how long will it last?
Gotta get strong fast
Out in the jungle
Jungle
That's how it is
Olu, got the music playing
Outside it ain't no playing
We just paying attention
Listening now to everything that's happening
Cause if it's on it's on
And it's always on
It's just like this song "Jungle"
What's gonna happen next out here
It's gettin' crazier, weirder
People losing spirituality, morality
What's happening
From Jazz B-Bop to Rappin'
It's all the same thing, a Black thing
A map thing, a world thing
Boy, girl thing
Woman, man, child
From Sweden to the Nile
To Australia, Europe
Africa to Venezuela
China, Japan
Everywhere you go understand
It's a jungle
The whole world
[Olu Dara]
Jungle
Jungle
JUNGLE!!
JUMGLE!!

[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence
That's for my niggas doing years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get em
Can we please pour out some liquor
Symobolizing let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep til slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle trying to gain
Smoking trauma, sniffing Ra while selling cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowing how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Blooding and thugging, folking and loking
Cryping and creeping, Latin and Kinging
Or just for poor righteous teaching
[Hook: Quan]
As day comes and night falls
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishing y'all were home
[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah and can we have another moment of silence
For brothers who died from Black-on-Black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dying
And can we please pour some more liquors
For Will,
 
Bokeem, Bar, Pappy my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple,
 
salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhyming Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hoping that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishing I was there with you
Let's take em home
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn
For Pac, Biggie and Pun, cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Tah and Aaliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we hope to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children
Who got raped or murdered 
or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Busting her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggas in the pen hoping rhymes'll get em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For every mother that held a son in the street bleeding
Crying a song of sorrow to dark and deep for speaking
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love em
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence?
That's for my niggas doin' years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?
Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain
Smokin' trauma
, 
sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to stop and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace?
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'
Or just for poor righteous teachin'
[Hook: Quan sings]
As days goes and nights fall
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishin' y'all were home
[Verse 2: Nas]
Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggas
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn?
For Pac, Biggie and Pun cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Alliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya...
[Nas]
Photographs of lost memories
On the blocks with blunts and Hennessey
Picture some niggas in mock neck shirts
Ballantine Ale in brown bags
Brothers like to brag 'bout their cousins
That locked in the system
We all fall victims, we all call Christian
Or Islamic faith, to restore all our faith
Barbed wire and tall brick wall
But we all can escape
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Nas]
I had a dream, I was a gangster drinking Moets, holding techs
Making sure the cash is correct, then I stepped
Investments in stock,
 
sewing up the blocks
To sell rocks,
 winning gun fights with the cops
Custom-made suits, hands full of ice and gold
Making thousand dollar bets on the dice I rolled
Girls working night patrol, the whore market
When I walk, niggas is rolling out the red carpet
Now how good could a black man have it?
Living like a king
, is a habit 
I keep an automatic
The whole crew life is love above word
Rumors about the way we make niggas well heard
Nicknamed the "Killa Clan"
Soon to kill a man
If there is still a gram
I shake my left hand
And not do a minute on the rock
Cause if I do a minute on the rock
The juries getting knocked
I'm 'bout girls, that kept braggin'
Cause I own all the runner-ups in every States Beauty Pagent
Inside a lamborgini, called the Martini
Little kids in the streets, they wanna be me
I'm living in a mansion, hold a niggas wife for ransom
I'm like a rich Charles Manson
A view, backyard, 
about 40 acres
You read about me in the papers
I hit the jackpot
Every night from all my crack spots
We attack cops for props
I got sons with guns, they all done crimes
They so wild
, they even scare my ass sometimes
Other niggas on the blocks is so corny
I got my dime, I'm lookin like someone smoke for me
Bad bitches kissing my ass
I got a few mill. in the stash
With beds made of cash
But on my head was a price
I made the bad-guys in Miami-Vice, look nice
All of a sudden, I got raided
My crib was invaded
But, the Nas still made it...
To the getaway car
And now my driving skills got to be up to par
The cops parked the car
And sprayed till it was smoked up
That's when I woke up
[Hook: Piano hook]
[Jungle]
Yea Nas, nigga
Word Life Kid
[Verse 2: Nas]
The whole thing was a nightmare
I fell asleep watching Scarface
Laying in the chair
Standing on the block
It was flooded with cops
Through the parks... Was the D's and the Narcs
Watching me walking out my building
Staring and hawkin shit
But I as fortunate
I usually be going out with the 9
Instead, I had 10 bucks to buy a dime...
Bag of weed
Never cracks I ain't with that
I bought buddha, some phillies, and a Kit-Kat
Now I'm walking back, through the drug infested area
Which is filled with hysteria
When a cop yelled, "Come here black."
I thought to myself, "what part of the game is that? "
I didn't do no crime, for you to be wasting your time
With your antagonistic mind
He said that I was being smart and I better run
He looked like a Klans-man with a gun
So I started floating
Police in Queensbridge, they don't be joking
I ran up my crib, in the nick of time
Rolled up a philly and stashed the 9
Police later left, I was outta breath
And what not
Somebody got shot, that why it's hot
I called my man and told him the adventure
And later, I meet him at the community center
I need a six pack, I'm vexed
It's Just Another Day in the Projects!
[Hook: Piano Hook]

[Sample 1]
Nas - "Hey Nas"
[Sample 2]
Amy Winehouse, "Just Friends"
This particular record was released Sept 17, 2011, in order to pay tribute to Amy Winehouse, who had passed 2 months before, July 23, 2011
Prior to this release, there had not been a Nas & Amy Winehouse collaborative song or remix out to our knowledge. So we felt the first to have one

[Hook]
To the kids in the p.j.'s
Ghetto children I know it ain't easy
Ya'll wanting millions
Sunshine turns to rain
Its ghetto pain
When a one time raise
Sometimes the young is slain
To the kids in the p.j.'s black babies
Brought up in this world where it's wild and crazy 
child of the Nile
Future lifestyle looks hazey
Dreams to drive a Mercedes
With a pile of ladies
[NAS]
Third grade singing star spangled banner
Using proper manners
Learnt to handle anger animal behavior
Later on my block rocking with my jocks on
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn
Humming a KISS rock song
Socks long to my knees
Summer breeze running through the leaves playing freeze tag
Can I stay out please dad
Can I hang out with my little gang out
Hearing shots rang out
Heard my moms call my name out
Come upstairs run up stairs
Take a bath shit stained underwear
Wipe yourself with paper bad
Little ass in my bed at 8:30 wash my plate
Ate dinner up late
Gazing at the wall praying basketball
Was my future for this young one
Hooping in the sun
Proud to be where I come from
Later shooting guns fantasizing
Fascinated by gold rope chains
Looking back at my hood days
But things ain't changed
[Hook]
[Millenium Thug]
In my hood niggas smoke wood
Nothing is good
Look at my eys and see what I could
Living my life and feel what I felt
The hand that I was dealt
Drama that my uncle Shabazz had
I was a little lad
Niggas shooting through my Grams window shattering glass
Had the chicken pox
On that toy horse that rocks
My moms grabbed me down to safety
Everybody in the crib was going crazy
That was in the 80's
And now im 17
Money cash dreams
Niggas be slave
I be brave spit like A.K.'s and S.K.'s
Close range niggas see brains
Millenium Thugs the name
But now it's slash cocaine
Blast niggas in vaine
Satch yo' chain
Cherrish the life
My niggas got a fetish for ice
Turn out the lights
I bust so I could spar up the night
Uniting the pipes
Queensbridge niggas is sheist
Need no price body yall dudes on spite
Who knew I would of spazzed out
Little Nayshawn owner of the crack house
Get my papes on
Tired of 'friderators all the steaks gone
[Wiz]
Now picture this shit
With six Aunts five Uncles
Thugging a double apartment out
Kids, cousins, and brothers
There I go in the pamper by the radiator
Cursing eatin first
Little nigga with a appetite that got worst
Firs day of school ten man cliq
All I'm learning is how to extort shit
'cuz class I forefit
Graduated on another level
Selling birds busting birds
Fuck with the herbs
Never we fuck up the herbs
Make 'em pay like you
Stick 'em up get down
Since ten was taught to turn 'em around
Rip they pockets out
Bust two the way they run
I ain't give a fuck that's how I was
I was young
[Hook]
[Horse]
Horse was born as a brave child
Big for my size
A bully to little guys
With chocolate miks and apple pies
The playground was mine
I stayed scarred up all the time
From shopping carts flipping
Now we race to the finish line
Hated playing cooties 'cuz that shit
Wasn't fun all the honey's say I'm it
Then they little ass run
I was sweared to put a hickey on the ones
That I caught
I was a nasty little nigga I learned to hump before I walk
Kept a sling shot on my side to shoot
Squirrles and cats
Wanted to be Captain America with the
Shield and the hat I started getting older fell
More in love with the streets
Infactuated by the ropes and the shiny
Gold teeth I was to big to break dance
Fuck spiining on my back
My role models now run numbers and sell
Crack this project child blessed
Chasing ghetto success
He needs a name for himself
To ge the same respect

[Intro]
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
[Verse 1: Tyga]
Uh, chandelier ceiling, my couch, don’t sit with denim
My marble floors are killing, 
gold cars are so relentless
5 girls in the kitchen, they cooking something like chemists
Monumental shit is, statues like Egyptians
God cover my soul, need it, can’t let it go
I know you get lonely when I ain’t home, on the road
I know I ain’t perfect, I’m out here working for the throne
I would take you along, but then that college loan you’ll owe
Young girls in cheap dresses, tryna impress us
Saying they all different, but I don’t show them no effort
Underestimated that R8, then I tested
Had to make investments, honey colored dressed it
I’m blessed it, cross-sign baptism West shit
Shit on anybody with opinions, you dead wrong
Go against a bull nigga head-on
I'm too strong, eight arms ticking to a bomb
Army stance, ready for war
We used a Andy Warhol to paint the decor
Apologizing for my actions, sometimes I get bored
They say my music knocks, so I hope it open every door
[Hook: Tyga] x2
We all dream one day we kings and queens
We all dream one day we be kings and queens
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
My nigga made it, we just young, living the dream
[Verse 2: Wale]
Never take this shit to heart, I take indo to chest
And now a nigga chasing dreams without losing his breath
Though my credits are slept, my ambition the best
Though I do this to be heard, I’mma do it to death
We in cool with all of these niggas
I’m through with all of these niggas
You fool with all of these niggas
You lose like all of these (niggas)
Honest, sincere, they seersuckers, lying in suits
Anybody riding with young’in will probably recoup
Heavenly Father, Martin, Malcolm mixed with them lyrics
Finna be king, but I’m way too proud to offer as (minion?)
I just offer a guillotine to my vehicle, nigga
And don’t offer least of shit to these people’s opinions
I’m a king to these niggas, love a queen, fuck the bitches
Double M-G,
 
Y-M-C-M, B
 
‘cause we run this you dig?
We all kings, give anything to my soft queens
I’m lost without them, when they around I am Charles Sheen
[Hook] x2
[Verse 3: Nas]
You’re in the presence of a majestic, esoteric
Message from the most ghettoest king, worldwide respected
I can say ghettoest ‘cause I come from where metal spit
Praying to God I can slide and slip out the Devil’s grip
Won’t pop another pill, can’t drink another sip
Tryna slow down with this pussy, I can’t, I love this shit
I seem to love these whips - a white
Maserati’s my birthright car,
 
pass it, I need another hit
At night, where they murdered Herbie Drawz
That’s the same block Metta World Peace learned to play ball
See I’m born alone, die alone, from the hoods to the private home
College to prison, understand it, knowledge and wisdom
Shout out to baby mothers of niggas who gangbang
‘Cause he could die any day and you still the same thing
So that make you a queen, surviving anything
Escobar season begins, so let the semis ring
Pimp of the year, I could smack your father
Not only with my hand, but with a black revolver
I been in pressed silk since breast milk
Mets cap on tilt, we some kings, nigga

[Hook]
Picture us married
, 
you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G
I remember the first time, girl you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
[Verse 1]
She was the modern Isis
, 
honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how excitin life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The 
sheistiest
, 
put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin we can stay together
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I see you dressed up in white face covered in veil
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
To a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Driving off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the states
You can throw your friend the 
bouquet
Something in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cuz I love you
Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop til I tell you me to, beautiful
Deeper and harder love layin new with you
Running my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
While I'm wit you and I won't even care, word
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
Til one day she decided to flip
It was nuttin I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talkin this divorcin shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With a fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen God bless you
[Hook to fade]

On the stage whylin, jumpin and laughin

[Verse 11: Chip Fu from The Fu-Schickens]
Yo! I strip the booth anytime my lips move
And it spews, my screws and they loose, I'm a move and it's proof
Now give me two minutes I'm still wicked and still kickin it
With skills built and hot {?} you can't step in my shoes YO!!
When I'm in the mood, when I'm in the booth and whenever when you

Nas give me eight bars, eight stars Escobar
Yo we rule, 
and we still ain't got nothin to prove,

[Outro: Nas]
Aiyyo Chi Ali hold ya head up in the peniles
This your man Nas, here they are
Unbelievable , Hip Hop is Dead
Let's see what happens aight!!!

(Intro) Movie Sample
"They can get to anyone, anywhere."
"Drugs, gambling, prostitution, all cash, all moved off shore
And 30% of their clients are legitiment
I wouldn't break this Firm
When that happens you're gonna go to jail like the rest of them
It'll happen someday believe me
Your life as you know it is over."
[Cormega]
Ayo, guns and roses, sons and soldiers
Drug game, cocaine, Ac's and Range Rovers
Snakes plan up ways to set their own man up
For grams when they bag up Cristal White
At night pistols might lift you like heat seeking missiles
Streets tempt you, police out to get you
Cause niggas you ran with got knocked and snitched too
Your bitch knew the time you faced
You didn't hide the safe
Now she's fucking in your fly estate
By the fireplace,
 
my shine stay laced
Mind original,
 
Firm La Familia,
 
organized criminal's boy
You just a hand to hand soldier, I'm a general
One way ticket to hell is what I'm sending you
Yo, your idiot rookie cops know my props go high
Like Himalayan mountains
Mega bouncing in the Z-3, counting up G's with no doubt son
[Nas]
I'll die for my niggas
Stick you for pies and lie for my niggas
Plead guilty, get the chair and fry for my niggas
It's essential that we all as they are like and mental
We've been through life, cold blood living sinful
Though we learn from old thugs that made it
Peeped how they've played it
We rated and evaluated, calculated the ages we be
The days we see, chips freely, beyond whips and TV's
Stock bonds, loot flipped the CD's
But niggas hate to see you on top
They'd rather be you what not
I keep the desert eagle up on cock
Spot the victories got quick, why pop shit?
My niggas leave you shot quick in a hop skip
Specialize in fly shit
VS on my breath while niggas gossip on the tactics
I'm on some 'Doe or Die' shit
[Foxy Brown]
Ill Nana capo, the Firm team Gestapo
36 moves, 37 ways triple days
Triple pays Nana, Fox boogy Firm mama
Kniver the lady cadaver or scarlet whichever O'Hara
The hazardous we laced the Lazarus
Dripping Gambinana, behind the liner
Three niners, from head to toe laced up in Gabbana
With Sosa chip, the 4.6 Range Rover to Villanova
From Castilino to Columbo, Foxy Brown papa
Beyond figures boo, I'll die for my nigga's rollie
The Firm controlee, they chop ki's to clock G's
Rock crocky's and drop three's and cop 3's
[AZ]
Check my lingo and all the white ice that make my rings glow
I've seen doe, got a dime wife from Santo Domingo
Face it, its mathematics, basics far from fake shit
My mind is sacred, my skin shine like a Cuban bracelet
Egyptian Pharaoh, potent ganja use to get me paro/paranoid
Now I inhale from gun shots, through my double barrel
Beneath the ground is how the sound travel
So what have you, keep the minds
FEDS not stopping 'til they grab you
Use to bust guns, now into stocks and trust funds
G's and CD's so my seed could soon touch some
The foulness, I once provoke, it's now behind me
Its gon' to take more than selling coke now to buy me
You have me thinking; I gotta kill to keep from sinking
That con way of life; that keeps live niggas from Lincoln
I saw it coming, that's why I slowed down from dumping
Most of my crew is running, can't even afford a summons

[JR GONG INTRO]
Now I and I say greetings in the name of The Mighty King
And I & I say played by the King love is all I bring
And I & I say Africa is I & I responsibility Dreadlocks
Yes, Huh!

Going to The Promise Land
Yes the Promise Land O Gosh now

[VERSE 1 JR GONG]
Imagine Ghana like California with Sunset Boulevard
Johannesburg would be Miami
Somalia like New York
With the most pretty light
The nuffest pretty car
Ever New Year the African Times Square lock-off
Imagine Lagos like Las Vegas
The Ballers dem a Ball
Angola like Atlanta
A pure plane take off
Bush Gardens inna Mali
Chicago inna Chad
Magic Kingdom inna Egypt
Philadelphia like Sudan
The Congo like Colorado
Fort Knox inna Gabon
People living in Morocco like the state of Oregon
Algeria warmer than Arizona bring your sun lotion
Early morning class of Yoga on the beach in Senegal
Ethiopia the capitol of fi di Congression
A deh so I belong
A deh di The King come from
I can see us all in limos
Jaguars and B'mos
[Hook 2 SAMPLE]
Riding on the King's Highway
To the Promise Land
Going to the Promise Land
O Gosh
Ye the Promise Land
Yeaha the Promise Land
Ooo
[VERSE 2 NAS]
Promised Land I picture Porsches
Basquiat Portraits
Pinky Rings realistic princesses
Heiresses bunch a Kings and Queens
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince
Powerless they not allowed to fit
But not about to slip
Vision Promised Land with fashion like
Madison Ave Manhattan
Saks 5th Ave and
Rodeo
Relaxing popping labels
Promise Land no fables
This where the truth's told
Use them two holes
Above your nose
To see the proof yo!
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when
The world was run by black men
Back to the future
Anything can happen
If these are the last days
And 100-foot waves come crashing down
I get some hash and pounds
Pass around the bud then watch the flood
Can't stop apocalypse
My synopsis is catastrophic
If satellites is causing earthquakes
Will we survive it
Honestly man it's the sign of the times
And the times at hand
[Hook 3 SAMPLE]
There's alot of work to be done, O gosh
In the Promised Land
In the Promised Land
O Gosh
Take me to The Promise Land
Ye the Promise Land
O Gosh now
To the Promise Land
Hey

No time for segregation
[Hook 4 SAMPLE]
In the Promised Land
Yes a to
The Promised Land
The Promised Land
Going to The Promise Land
Ooo
There's a lot of work to be done in the Promise Land

[Verse 1: Nas]
My stripes show like regiments, military intelligence
Murder game, I leave no evidence -- credentials
Go ask my pre-school, even talk to my old principal
He'd tell you how you I used to pack a No. 2 pencil
Stabbing students, grabbing teachers, Catholics, preachers
In the school staircase, cutting class, passing my reefer
In my own class,
 
operation return, they tried to say
I was incompetent, not able to learn
The table turned now, got my own label I earn
Like that nigga said in "Dead Presidents", money to burn
Queensbridge, pay homage respect, Nas is the vet
Acknowledge the rep,
 
polish baguettes,
 
niggas is this and that
I'm just the best, putting all violence to rest
Between Latin Kings the bloods los sangres, blood in Spanish
So many thugs vanish, unite the system
To fight with inner street wisdom, to help teach a prison
[Verse 2: Big Punisher]
My crew puff lye,
 
anyone test the Pun must die
Just give me one try
Now you know you done fucked up right
Hah, you ain't got no wins in mi casa
Que te pasa, you ain't even in my clasa
I hate an actor that plays a rapper
I'm Terror Squad beta kappa everybody's favorite rapper
Grand imperial, college material, insane criminal
The same nigga who known to blow out your brain mineral
I reign subliminal inside your visual
Try to supply your physical with my spiritual side of this lyrical
I'll appear in your dreams, like Freddie do, no kidding you
Even if I stuttered I would still sh-sh-sh-shit on you
Soon as I chitter chatter your shit'll shatter
I'm the kid out of Bronx, that'll stomp you to death like it didn't matter
I'm even better than before,
 
iller metaphors
Killers bet it all on Pun, cause one verse, dead em all
[Hook: scratches by DJ Spinbad]
J-J-J-John Blaze
Ja-Ja-ah-John Bla-Blaze
J-Ja-J-Ja, John Blaze
Johnny Blaze
 ain't a damn thing changed
[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Aiyyo my attitude is subject to change
I mess around
 
and spit twelve at the driver's side door of your Range
Six hit you, the other six, up in your dame
Mafia style, leave you with your watch and your chains
Take heed that, not only can I flow I can aim
Cause y'all misdemeanor niggas can't stand the reign
Better believe that, whenever I see y'all I'ma test ya
Only cause I know that faggots respect pressure
Hardcore, like shit you get, kicked out the yard for
Kiss ain't the cops, but I lock niggas up
You could meet me in my cell, I soap and sock niggas up
Far as the flow go, you could let your dough show
Put your money on the table, we could battle on cable
Y'all hot dog niggas get nathans
Fuck around with Jason, that shorty from The Lox
, John Blazin
[Verse 4: Raekwon]
My son cool out (what) don't beef yo, throw the tool out
Let's run these niggas, kidnap they work, make em move out
Crushed hash, hands is like glass
, 
keep the heat
In the dash
, 
did some dirt for some work, caught a gash
The flicker blocker, wicked sneaker rocker footwear
Strike me out God
, 
stacking up joints, rack em like Footlocker
This is raw, raw like fuck kid, represent
Here to Crenshaw
Hold my words stronger than a Benz stall
Relentless,
 
the anthology consolidated
With the quickness
, 
dress up in the wig and blouse
, 
killer sickness
Lex
, imagination large,
 gold cards
Beat the bogus squad brains that connect put on the 
Older God
Specialist, 
iciclist,
 
Woolrich collar
Feeling the rich, work for every dollar don't snitch, that's why
Broke niggas who got heart God, sign 'em up
Start the wind up, we John Blazin
Don up in the line up
[Hook]
[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
It's simple mathematics, you gotta love us
Cause Joey Crack plus gat equals a lotta dead motherfuckers
Just when you thought I was done, I recruited Pun
Terror Squad Enterprise,
 
undisputed Dunn
I'm from the slums where it's worse, 
bust with guns til it hurts
For fucking with my funds on the first
And go to church like a mobster
Discuss your death over shrimp and lobster
With my Cuban partners
Lucas with the cartridge, twenty shot
Run up on any block, disrespect any cop
Used to run many spots, now I own shops
Gortex with the lot, five sixty-four bills a pop
I'm hot, who wanna get burned
I fire one in your knot and watch your whole fuckin' head turn
You best learn to 
parley
, I've had a hard day
Fuck around with the Don and get John Blazed
[Hook x2]

[Hook - Nas + Nashawn]
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful mind we brave men
I blow smoke and I'mma keep sayin
[Verse 1:Nashawn]
I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper calm
I'm gonna kill something
Rap cats be real frontin
Fuck shootin legs
Cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how bout that
Close range with the gauge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn corners when you turn corners, know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside
(Chorus)
[Verse 2: Nas]
I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin hell
 
stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you wit me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin)
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter
If the court parole ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is coming
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal
(Chorus)

[VERSE 1 - Nas]
Yeah!
Got out the 600
Blunted
Chicks hunt him
Neighborhood know he comin'
Jakes hate him
Snakes could not violate him
Pimps memorize his lines-verbatim
He reps N.Y. yo
Gives C-notes to winos
Not church
It's how he tithe though
He walks the tenement
Sleeps at his super fly condo
My kinda nigga
My Icon, my Idol
No certificate
For this misfit who handle business
The odds stacked against him
He fights back mackin Benzes
Never puts cash or ass
Before friendship
He laughs last?
As some die young
He is still existing
Somehow he got around the pitfalls of the system
When he walks we watch
When he talks we listen
Leaders

Who do I follow?
Who do I copy?
Look in to the mirror
And it's you I see look at me
Everything new
Like it fresh from the factory
Everything you do?
It impact me
Your lifestyle attract me
Parents try distract me
When I grow up
I want to be like you exactly
And as soon as I get over this acne
There's no way anybody coulda stop me
Me gravitate toward the aura
And all the mannerism
The sending out of orders
And man start moving busy
The locking of the corners?
The streets and all the buildings
Mi love you like a father
Mi ready and mi willing
Anything what you a talk
Is law in my dominion
And mi have similar thoughts
I share the same opinions
Mi have it say you smart
With mi best interest at heart
I'm following your path
Yow mine whe you a walk

They appeal to the conscious
The Paramount
The Caesar, the monsters
The grandiose, the martyrs
The hell on earth pompous
Ellsworth Bumpy Johnsons
The Harlemites the Garveyites
Black as the credit card we swipe
Poppin' Dom tonight
For all of mine
I can see myself back at the 
Autobahn
Malcolm on the podium
Shells drop to linoleum
Swipe those
Place 'em on display at the Smithsonian
Next to only gems
That were left behind
By holy men
Infectious
Charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexists
Resistance against oppression
Progressive thinking
Ghetto speakers
Protestors against the colored
Only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon
The contradiction
The cross the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinning
On Esau's back inscription
That 
it was written
That nothing is coincidence
'n
They took our leaders and they lynched them

[Cee-Lo (Nas)]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la..
(Uh-oh, yeah)
[Nas]
Mr. International
The man centerfold women loathe
Voice bump out the Bose in a tinted Rolls
Craftiness, take a stab at it
Don't ask if Nasty's back at it
I don't run out of magic
Popular, 
box-cutter flow
Time is money; the watch cost dough
Shaking the dice, fragrances from some beautiful ladies
The lights, the ambiance, yeah, this is the life
The money, hotties on each arm--It's on
I party like a rap star
, baby the facts are
The third time's a charm
So meet me by the Eiffel Tower
Bring a bottle of Dom
[Cee-Lo]
I am here (I am here)
This is the place (This is the place)
The atmosphere of espionage at expensive tape
And each one that I see is an unfamiliar face
So I guess I'll just cut straight through the chase
And before I could say the name of who've I came to see
Someone suspicion then came to me
I'm so close and I've come so far
A glass of red wine sits from the women at the end of the bar
I love to talk to you; but I don't have the time
She looks like the prettiest part of a perfect crime
Ohh if I could I could I'd put a picket fence around a wild flower
But darling I have Less Than an Hour
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Hmmmm... Ohhhh... funny how time flies when you're having fun
(Nas: Yeah, let' em know) But I got to do what must be done
[Nas]
You're on a winning streak
You've survived the killer streets
Now you at the crap table, where the real villains meet
Number seven might get you to Heaven
You break the bank, just might make you a legend
It's after eleven, you playing against a poker face
Genie eyes, light green, sipping on Bellini's
You play your cards right, she'll let you touch
She'll be a devil in disguise; lady incubus
Better know who to trust
She might roll with thugs who roll bodies up
 
in Asian rugs
I'mma rush up and move on 'em, put the uz' on 'em
The crews do something new, inform me
[Cee-Lo]
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Ohhh... time will wait baby
(I.... have Less Than an Hour)
Ew-ohhh.... ewwwwwwwww.... hmmmmm..
I'm in the pursuit of my own personal power
And I only have an hour

[Intro: Nas]
Uh, yeah, it's like that
They wanna know how nigga do it, youknowwhatimsaying?
I had a nigga come up to me and ask me and shit
Why I ain't got that, youknowhatimsaying?
Fuck nigga get on your job, nigga let your nuts hang beeitch
Check it out though
[Hook: V-12]
These well, theeeeeese
41st side Lake Entertainment
Oh yeah, if you come to QB you gonna get...
[Nas]
Yo, foes decompose in their coffins, hoes creeping with bosses
No sleeping my fortress break day thinking of losses
Taxes and IRS government gangstas
But I'm a scientist in love with big president faces
My residence changes from ghetto to acres
Avoiding jealousy snake shit
Can't afford another felony lake bent, driving them Porsche
Niggas saying Nas came through with a flying saucer
With some strange shoes on the tiring flossing
So now they now wanna offer 'em killing stick 'em and cost 'em
Catch him slipping, tripping get 'em for all his fortune
What's up with this Nas hatred? Y'all can suck my dick
Got these niggas wives naked making them fuck my fist
My mystique have the world froze
My physique got me dressed up in shell toes
And ganja leaf, I inhale slow
I'm from out of town capsule some kind of portal
Spitting these rhymes at you like I'm immortal
[Hook: V-12]
Lay low, lay low (lay low)
Cause all y'all niggas know (y'all niggas)
If you come to QB you're gon' get murdered
(You're gon' get murdered, murdered, murdered)
You're gon' get murdered (Why get shot up?)
If you come to QB you're gon' to get murdered
[Lake]
Same old dudes that jewel me, now salute me
I've grew more than they ever though I would be
Having no pops to mourn me, just show me
God didn't plan for another man to control me
You know me from busting my gun blood
But even up north my cell smell like Christian Dior
Before I lost my case I had to gain mastered
Been had heart now my papers starting to match it
I stack 'til they capture me and kept a bottle of half-a-G
And sold 20's while I rap to beats
My wifey beef over my robberies
But they've put my mans in the "L" still on the armory
Loyal to the heritage, though I put seven in it
Dude snaked me, word to Spanky, I never snitch
I put a bullet in your face 'fore I go to Jake
Rule number one out here; DON'T FUCK WITH LAKE
[Hook: V-12]
[Nas]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Our guns are haunted with the ghost of bodies
Smoke 'em like we supposed to
Your whole crew comes face to face with shotty
Told you! Bravehearted, we appear when it's on
Light up your block like its day time
 y'all niggas be gon'
So many niggas that's be pursuing Nas, when they spot me
They be jumping out of moving cars and landing on my Timbs
I tell 'em be careful don't damage the skin
Amateurs cram around with the hopes to get glance at the end
[Lake]
Ayo most of my friends have ulterior motives
I'm wise cause I now realize that sound is golden
Mourned shorty, from cat shacky who wrote to me
Living through them back then was giving hope to me
I control many, being a flossiest
Most notorious, Queensbridge extortionist
Love my hood no question, I'mma rep it
But I'm not just a QB tenant, I'm the President
[Hook: V-12]

[Intro Skit]
Someday I'm gonna be walkin down the streets
Mindin my own business.. and BAM!!
I'm gon' be shot by some pig who's gonna SWEAR
That it was a mistake
I accept that as a part of my destiny!
{*
Si es mi destino morir en la calle como un perro
! Hahaha*}
[Raekwon the Chef]
Whattup kid? That's right..
Yo.. aiyyo.. aiyyo..
[Hook: Raekwon]
Aiyyo let my niggas live
We show and prove get paper, catch me in the caper on shrooms yo
Let my niggas live
We real niggas that's God-body, challenge anything, make major moves
Let my niggas live
We giants, live off the land lions, post with iron,
 no pryin rules
Let my niggas live; aiyyo let my niggas live
Handle your bid and kill no kids
[Raekwon the Chef]
Millionaire feat, whole family eat; yo, y'all niggas is weak
Got a bird beak, chirp chirp speak
Kids that's rich that'll, run in your bitch and by the third week
Yo mark my word, me and my herb speak
That's that fire move like Schwinns yo
Invisible pens that write light, leave blends
Hit with the JF Kennedy shot
Smash with the Acapulco rifle got got
Bolt off, but got clocked
Legendary here, custom made it, shit bladed, word up
Design your alphabet, reps get graded
We in get-high saloons, big bag of shrooms, arm's length
Home of Allah's ten big rooms
So what we up in here, modelin large with rigorous moves
Exotic Gods bust my hammer at frauds
Call him a live merchant, dressed in all red, that's right y'all
Gucci jumper X-5, gettin more head
[Hook]
[Nas]
I scream at the mirror, curse, askin God, "Why me?"
Run in the black church, gun in my hand, y'all try me
I'm God-son, son of man, son of Marcus Garvey
Rastafari irie, Ha-ile Selassie
Police'll try to break us, but the streets raised us
It takes more than metal bars
, we destined for ours
I hear murder plans from dopefiends,
 
with elephant hands
Snots in they nostril,
 
the blocks is hostile
There's no pots to piss in, Glocks is spittin
Rocks cookin underground bodies stiffin, cops look at bird shit
Drop on the window pane, the oxygen is cocaine
It drove lots of men to die with no name
I been on boats, nut down throats, pee on bitches who famous
Pretty dick, puttin stitches in they anus
I'm the animal that Hugh Heffner created
The only nigga Sade dated, the most hated, Nas nigga
[Hook]
[Inspectah Deck]
Roughneck reppin the set, bang 'em twice in the neck
C.O. flip and jerk the whole yard rec
Block vets, pop barettas Glocks and tecs
You're no threat, gun talk, the language of the project
Checkin shorty with the +Black Tail+ stance, leapord pants
Yellin fuck her man, makin killings off her lap dance
Plus the young guns runnin the slums, funds is major
Drugged out, got you huntin for crumbs stuck to the razor
Semi-autos roar in the building hall
Symptoms of bloodsport, the slugs are still in wall
Call it a 
New York state of mind
, gotta take mine
In the daytime, the Jakes'll hit ya forty-one times
So I live by the sword and obey hood laws
Make my team click like high heels on wood floors
[Hook]

[Produced by J. Cole & No. I.D.]
[Intro]
Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's being born same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end, as far as rap goes
It's only natural, I explain my plateau
And also what defines my name
[Hook]
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor now let the story begin
[Verse 1: Nas]
I ain't mad at you, young king,
 
this unsung song is haunting
Along comes a one son called a offspring
The Earth spins, my Old Earth grin, sung a church hymn
She birthed in September,
 
took my first wind,
 
again, the Earth spins
I jumped in my first Benz, fled out, lead out
Screams got in the game and took bread out
The nerve of these niggas, weak flow
, 
yo Cole let's murder this sequel
Freedom or jail from Fayetteville to QB though
Cause back when I was young there was massive niggas
But I passed them niggas, just being nasty nigga
Military hat, fatigue pants sagging,
 
Henny'd up
Execs asking will he live to see his own release date happen
Straight off the corner with the armor
, 
arm and hammer
But I had a appeal, I was a charmer
Yet still being my mama's son was my biggest honor
This shit was just kinda just a hobby in my project lobby
We was trying to be the Queensbridge Cosby's
But the street life robbed me of that, so I had to put it in raps
And who could I ask for help? Older niggas was getting mad
But that's the gift and the curse, that's the good and the bad
At least you got Jay, but he already one of the greats
And it's hard for the great to tell somebody how to be great
Nigga I tried and niggas threw that shit right back in my face
They took my cosign, but they ain't let me EP their tapes
And when they joint tanked, that's when they point blame
So point blank, young Cole, you won't be the same
The first album freedoms and them fourth album pressures
A big difference between 'em but I get why you said it
Radio records are needed, I just wanted it to bring the warning
Global warming to that cold world you was breathing
That's some advice I never got
If I don't sell another record, I'll just steady rock
While you was writing down my rhymes I was just trying to show you
That if you say what's on your mind, you can stand the test of time
Now I'm playing Born Sinner loud,
 
saw you live, rock the crowd
Like wow, you made your nigga Nas proud
So you ain't let Nas down
It's just part of the game, becoming a rap king, my nigga
You ain't let Nas down
How that sound? Here the crown, pass it to you like nothing, nigga
You ain't let Nas down
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Slick Rick was like Jesus, G Rap wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
Large Professor's my mentor, that's how the story end

[The Game]
Second floor of my hotel, I'm rollin' up bout to blaze
And zone out, to this Frankie Beverly and Maze
As I daze about the past, and them days in the past
He set my mind free, so my mind free at last
So much that I don't even drink from a fuckin' glass
I'd rather find the first fountain I can and do it fast
Didn't understand the dream of a King, do the math
Coincidentally on your birthdays I ditched the class
Cause the younger me, dumber me was chasin' the cash
Chasin' the ass, lowlife with his face in the grass
Ridin' home from school, in front of the bus
Not even thinkin' bout how Rosa Parks done it for us
How she stayed behind bars and she done it for us
And she stayed behind bars 'til she won it for us
Sometimes I wanna give up or at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face
Cause sometimes I wanna give up and at least take a break
That's when I close my eyes and see Coretta Scott's face
[Nas]
Standin' at the pew, panaramic view of the seatin' and greetin'
I've been meanin' to do me some letter readin'
To the King, he forever breathin', your message is never leavin'
Some of your homies phonies, I should've said it when I see them
Them sleazy bastards, some greedy pastors, jerks
Should never be aloud at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta
So people be patient, I know this ghetto grammar
But I'm a street dude, normally I just speak rude
Martin Luther, the martyr
, the trooper, hate killed him
Nobel Peace Prize winner, they duplicate your feelin'
As a kid I ain't relate really
I would say your dream speech jokingly, 'til your world awoke in me
First I thought you were passive, soft one who ass kissed
I was young but honest, I was feelin' Muhammad
I ain't even know the strength you had to have to march
You was more than just talk, you the first real Braveheart, we miss you
Feel like King be in me sometimes
[The Game]
The word nigger, is nothin' like nigga
Don't sound shit a like, like Game, like Jigga
One came before the other, like aim and pull the trigga
One is slang for my brother, one is hang and take a picture
The rope ain't tight enough, he still alive, go fix it
Pour some gasoline on him, call his daughters black bitches
Make 'em pick cotton, while they mama cleanin' up the kitchen
Same cotton in white T's, that's the cotton they was pickin'
If Dr. King marched today would Bill Gates march
I know Obama would but would Hilary take part
Great minds think great thoughts
The pictures I paint, make the Mona Lisa look like fake art
I feel the pain of Nelson Mandela
Cause when it rains it pours, I need Rihanna's Umbrella
For Coretta Scott's tear drops, when she got the phone call
That the future just took a fuckin' head shot
I wonder why Jesse Jackson ain't catch him before his body dropped
Would he give me the answer
Probably not

[Hook x2]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I've been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official
[Verse 1]
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought "Kick In The Door" was for?
But that's my heart,
 
y'all still tripping off the Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'mma tell you how the whole thing start
Off top I brung Queens up from hard times
Rocking at the Fever
, 
streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues
, 
dropping out schools
The crack epidemic had rap representing the rules
So I got in them shoes, tried 'em, wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit so I couldn't sport 'em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warring
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island
, and Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changing, I had a baby
I was making my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticing my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed 'em in with more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label
, 
Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thing
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it
, 
before Ready To Die hit
Big and I hit blunts performing at the Ark
Next thing you knew, Big blew and all the balling starts
He had Kim in his crew
, 
I found Fox
Only niggas in New York with number one charts
Big was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon my niggas
But dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on the purple tape
Bad Boy biting Nas album cover way
Big told me Rae was stealing my slang
And Rae told me out in
 
Shaolin
, 
Big would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us
, but hit with 
"Ain't No Nigga"
Had much Versace swagger
Big admired the Brooklynite and took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today don't know nothing, about this boss shit
There's more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Rap became a version of 
Malcom and Martin
Rest In Peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
Had lost trust for Steve Stoute at some point til I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal? Puff soaked Interscope offices
With champagne bottles on Steve, and Steve thought the drama's on me
Cause previously it would have been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learn, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
Then this nigga's with Jigga too much, he used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone planning
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hitting the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs
, thinking he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars who might follow
Taught her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss, It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores
In the Firm I learned I Am NaStradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with mama
She was getting old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not til I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assassinate my character, degrade my hood
Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What y'all want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse?
 
Fuck that shit, the first shall be last
I'm the man's man,
 
a rapper's rapper
G-O-D S-O-N, they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad
 
for dolo
[Hook]

Yeah, check check, testing
It's clear out there, yeah
It's like I'm hang glidin' over the hood, ha
Never worry, ohhh, no, no, no
[Verse 1]
Check, let there be light
No gang bangin' in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls, bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic cause ya'll ain't listenin' right
What's all this talk that Nas got bought
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Ain't nobody been where I been
, 
they at a stand still
This is all overseen by my man Will
[Hook: Tre Williams]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And I know my business, so my sins great
And I thank the hood for all the love they gave
And I forgive 'em all, they did they best to hate
Oh, let there be light
[Verse 2]
This ain't the glorified, just paintin' the street picture
There's no guidance or Bibles, just blunts and swishers
Gillettes cut 'caine in kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth "Supreme" Griffith
It's like the same difference except when niggas get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, niggas get to snitchin
If I could reverse demises and turn falls to rises
And bring back the niggas who was livest
Old hustlers, reminiscing on better days
They home, doing nothing, might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers
, 
one foot in the grave
They used to love us till we found our own way thru the maze
New York, set trippin and flaggin
Got the West Coast laughing, now Esco's asking
What happened? 
My homegirl from upper Manhattan
She remembers the quarters that's Latin, alotta rat-a-tat-tatting
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The son of the audio cassette era
, 
tech wearer
Bullets and begets
, 
Benz Bose Speaker Terror
'Til man I get mine till I'm dead, so I can drive somethin' red
Like that horse standing on it's hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in they bunk beds
I wanted bread like Wonder,
 
not manned-a-wanno like the parent of Lionel
Nas is the Ghetto American Idol
No matter what you do you're never getting my title
I can't sound smart cause y'all run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about 'ye
Like there's no other way for a ex-hustler
Cake getter, the ex-wig splitter to touch you, I beg to differ
When you're four years into the game, we can have a conversation
Eight years in the game, I invite ya on vacation
Ten years in the game, after I've enjoyed my fame
Only then I let ya pick my brain, niggas
[Bridge: Nas] + (Tre Williams)
[And I] Right about now [And I] (They don't really know)
[And I] (They don't really see) I don't even deal with all that garbage
(No, no, no) We getting real right, ya know?
[And I] (Though I walk through the valley) That is Tre Williams ladies and gentlemen
[And I] (They should fear no) [And I] (no, no-oh)
Focus on good things man, good times, Heh-heh, alright
[Hook] - 2X (with alterations)
Oh let it be, let it be, yeah
Let it be, let it be

[Intro] (Nas)
Chi-ching, haa, chi-ching, haa
[Hook]
(Nas)
Take a picture, cherish it
, I'm God's Son, inherence it
This is level 7 where gangster and mobsters stepping
(Nashawn)
Take a picture, cherish it, its Nashawn
My feature is heaven, safe for the bitches, this is level 7
[Nas]
Number 1, uhh what does it take to have a woman's bra?
[Nashawn]
Intelligently they mind done
[Nas]
And what about shopping and copping expensive things
[Nashwan]
Take them on yachts and lobster, rocks and rings
[Nas]
? Crash with a transvestite on its best night
But nigga not me on a hot night
I'm with a sister whose thick as shit and she knock me
[Nashawn]
You hit her off properly then let her get on top of me
Level 2 is elementary stage
[Nas]
The first thing a slave learned is its country amazing
[Nashawn]
They separated the families on ever plantation
[Nas]
Feeing for that black pussy, slaves masters chasing
[Nashawn]
Chase they women like they chicken feet
Violating, raping 'em
Rip their clothes, let their niggas see
[Nas]
And that's the start of the first black pimps history
[Nashawn]
Told his queen if they want to fuck, make them pay a fee
[Hook] - 2X
[Nas]
Level 3, God answer me, is there any devil in me?
[Nashawn]
Naw there's thug and there's rebel in me
[Nas]
Hood like ghetto tears falling down my eyes
[Nasahwn]
How about the staircase, kill them with a surprise
[Nas]
I'm willing to live and willing to die
[Nashawn]
Kill a man for a cause, I'm willing to fry
[Nas]
While my people say it's a fucked up predicament
[Nashawn]
You talk the wrong thing, school learned ignorance
[Nas]
Now my religion is the all mighty 
Dallam
[Nashawn]
There's everybody making this money
Turn this street game to pimp game scholar
[Nas]
Level 4, never make a whore to a house wife
With my charisma
[Nashawn]
It takes a special kind of dude just to pimp her
[Nas]
Level 5, I leaned the ways of the streets when I was only 9
[Nashawn]
Turn nothing into a dime, beer into wine
[Nas]
Wine into Champaign, Chris, level 6
[Nashawn]
Only millionaire shit, buying buildings, and real estate
Me and my gorillas chill to sell a home away
[Nas]
Went from savvy to humane
Welcome to level 7, enter the life of true fame
[Hook] - 2X

I wake up every morning
Thinking what we gon' do today
(What we gon' do today)
There's got to be a better way
(Got to be a better way)
To maintain is the price of fame
Life is like a dice game
(Maintain is the price of fame)
Life is like a dice game
1, 2...
I never knock a brother
I'm anti-jail for real
Smooth criminal skill
Locked in a human flesh shield
Watching niggas get rich beside me
Pushing a 5 B-Y me up in the passenger seat
But I see me as Hallie Selassie in my kingdom
Sipping Asti Spumante
Dripped in, 
reality kicks in
I need the papes to start clicking
Got a connect out in Richmond
Every nigga in the fam will pitch it
It's on, word is bond
That's my name, big Nas
All wise to civilize
From the Northern Hemisphere of the earth
Peace to my seed and thanks for her birth
Destiny, that's her name
It's going on
You know my name
Big Nas in the house, y'all
On the freestyle tip
When I finish this shit
It's sure to be a hit

[Nas]
Yo 
ill will
, ruff ryders
What what, sraight like that
[Verse 1]
You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that I wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penitentiary, sending me letters I answer back
That eventually, we all be bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns
, 
fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate
, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast, nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say I did the right thing
[Hook x4]
Life is what you make it nigga, I'mma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it(uh)
[Verse 2: DMX]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Everyday shit, around the way shit got me stressed
 (what)
So I keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna test (uh)
I got no time for games cause I'm all grown up
You wanna joke nigga? laugh when you get blown up (come on)
See how funny it is when your kids ain't got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bumb shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Make history before you go
Fuck the misery, you livin' po' we gettin doe
Except the dollars other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is valuable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughter feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Payin' doctors when I'm born, a preacher if I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life diminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game,
 can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on
, 
hope for the best
Prepare for the worst,
 no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last nigga,
 let's get this cash nigga
[Hook]

[Intro]
(AZ) Ayo what's up what's up let's keep it real son
Count this money, you know what I'm sayin'
(Nas) Yeah yeah
(AZ) 
Ayo put the Grants over there in the safe you know what I'm sayin'
Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
(Nas) I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes you know what I'm sayin'
Yo then what man, what
[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 Percenters
But something must've got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some rest in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so
Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers, will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die
[Hook: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one,
 
cuss while I pus from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying "fuck tomorrow"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
[Hook]

[Intro]
To my niggas.. huh..
We all we got..
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..
[Chorus]
It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
And the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose
, bring 
fake snakes
 and 
hoes
And the only way out, is death or goin broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggas in it
And I'll admit it, this life is fucked up but yo..
(but yo..) this life is the only life I know {*echoes}
[Verse:1]
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, makin love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rollin up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and submachines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Child both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dyin
Cause it's hard to fuck around when we dealin with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone sayin, "Please daddy pay it"
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, 
you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggas want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink? Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, comin out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos
, 
bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard fuckin with niggas you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to fuck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wantin you stuck
[Chorus]
[Verse:2]
Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rollin wit you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the ear?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a ho
And you don't even let him know, cause you fucked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
Then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they seperate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggas don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggas get hit, I'mma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'mma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
Til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong? Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret bein grimy
What's lust, a bust nut? What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs, til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
When he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll stop tickin, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya
You gettin older player, look at those who gave up
[Chorus]

* iTunes bonus track
[Intro]
Ay yeah, what's happenin mommy? How you doin baby?
Oh you lookin kinda good and everything, I see you with them stilettos on baby
Ay check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me?
Ay let me put the bug in your ear baby
Why don't you turnin' them floor shoes into some ho shoes, ya dig?
Yeah, check this out, this Universe Finest, your Royal Highness
You know what baby? I can do a whole lot of thangs for you
Guess why, cause I'm a motherfuckin pimp
[Hook: singer]
(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe
(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase
I-In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you, you a nigga
(Like me...) Hustlin and grindin babe
(I be...) Stayin on that paper chase
In this life there's pimps and hoes
Tell me which one are you
[Verse 1]
The good man in me say "Get money and stay on the path"
But the pimp shit in me say "Yo, keep lookin for ass"
But my daughter gave me a gift, somethin to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow
I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes
Better wait till you grown, when he love you, you'll know
Everybody's got a dream, a hopeful wish to own a six times two
Cylinder whip, a fantasy, a bone to pick
Or ends to get against who I don't know
Someone who said you won't blow, you won't eat, you won't cake
They mistake blamin me for they failures, I'm fresh, gettin tailored
Single breasted, a lip brush, it's senseless, some pimp shit
A woman hates a man and stays with him for many years
Tell him she loves him and be jealous of him
Now lame is how the ghetto judge him, cause he still with her
She'll take his cash and give it to some other real nigga
[Hook]
[Interlude]
Ay pimpin been goin on man for eons and eons man since the beginnin of time
You know me, the only thing I need to do is get on the grind and get mine
So the only thing I gotta tell you man is you know, do what you gotta do man
Bring my money back, get on that track and get on your back
[Verse 2]
I heard 'em say the NBA's a bunch of million-dollar slaves
Or [Poitier](pending) wasn't real back in the days, the point I make is
Jerry owns the Lakers, his yearly takings
Let's just say more than collectively all of his players
That's business, not really pimp shit
Maybe a tid-bit similar to when we rappers make big hits
And not own the masters, that's the deal
By the way, Poitier helps all the Denzels excel
He kept it more than real, but Hollywood can turn a girl out
I knew a girl bout, 5'9", so fine, she could result grind
She was sleek, sheek, with a classic mouth
Movie directors always fucked her on the casting couch
She came out with a blockbuster, can't knock a hustler
She not a hooker, she focused, a hopeless soul on a lonely road
I showed her all my stones and gold
I said "Bitch, life is cold, you need to roll with a nigga"
[Hook]

[Chorus]
I never wanted you to be my man
I just needed company
Don't want to get dependent on
Your time or who you spend it on
I lose it when you love me
Like smoke, I hung around in the unbalanced
Woah, ohh
[Verse 1: Nas]
It’s not a movie, this is not a script to proofread
I’ll spit some untruths to dumb fools and
 
groupies
Fun to punctuate, pronounciate the funds I make
The miles I take
 
put in your face
Oh my mistake, you’re not a floozy
Then excuse me
Before I talk, my style introduced me
Get your name and phone number like 1-2-3
Y’all know the story, y’all know the commentary
I kick the narrative, this is legendary
The good Samaritan, hood thespian
Like a polygamist, with a twist
Will I marry again?
 Maybe, I guess
I hold a lady’s interest, I just met
The love scholar
, 
she’s the teacher’s pet
Every other eve we meet and make each other sweat
I feel triumphant
, 
no strings
Just a fling to have fun with
I be out in London, Camden
Huntin’ for the answers, why did God take away the homie?
I can’t stand it
I’m a firm believer that we all meet up in eternity
Just hope the big man show me some courtesy
Why? ‘Cause I’m deemed a heart breaker
Like smoke, girls linger ‘round a player
[Chorus]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, this recession is a test
It’s affecting my complexion
Misdirectin' my affection
My concerns are bill collections
The facts is the taxes, they after me
Chapter three, my property
My handlers, they dealt with me improperly
I say some things I should probably keep privately
Evaluate the world bank trusts like I’m IEG
Those fly suites and my 
bourgeoisie
Tall freak, she wouldn’t protest with me at Wall Street
She says, no you’re so deep
I said, no let’s go through it
Historically so ruthless as feds came for Joe Louis
She said, my man you need to laugh sometimes
Classifies me as a whore, I tell her have some wine
You colder than penguin pussy, in her dismay
She’s thinkin’ that’s just so silly to say
But if you really think about it hussy
See a penguin, he drags his ass on the ground all day
And it’s a dragon, it’s a bastard you’re in tune with, just lust
I’m through with you after my crush
So is that humorous enough?
The smoke I puff
Tell the car to go to Aura,
 
Funky Buddah
, Whisky Mist
 
on Mayfair
I hope I meet Monie Love so she can show me love
NYC to UK I might stay there
Everybody in the club tonight say, “Yeah”
You know how me and Amy are, straight players
[Outro]
Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh

[Intro:]
Uhh, Uhh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill
[Verse 1]
Yo my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mac in my right arm, Tequila bottle in
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, Can´t do myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I ain't shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I ain't saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me
[Hook]
I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself
[Verse 2]
Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My decadent lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I ain't your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the haze blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
The reason that I want to be alone
Tired of all the things that went wrong
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, driving again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...
[Hook]

[Hook]
It's like that y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
That y'all (that y'all!), that y'all (that y'all!)
And that's all!
[Nas]
Street's disciple,
 
my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr Tuffy while I'm
 
on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was twelve, I went to hell for snuffing Jesus
Nasty Nas is a rebel to America
Police murderer, I'm causing hysteria
My troops roll up with a strange force
I was trapped in a cage and let out by the Main Source
Swimming in women like a lifeguard
Put on a bulletproof nigga I strike hard
Kidnap the President's wife without a plan
And hanging niggas like the Ku Klux Klan
I melt mics till the sound wave's over
Before stepping to me you'd rather step to Jehovah
Slamming MC's on cement
Cause verbally, I'm iller than a AIDS patient
I move swift and uplift your mind
Shoot the gift when I riff in rhyme
Rapping sniper,
 speaking real words
My thoughts react, like Steven Spielberg's
Poetry attacks, paragraphs punch hard
My brain is insane, I'm out to lunch, God
Science is dropped
, 
my raps are toxic
My voicebox locks and excels like a rocket
[Hook]
[Joe Fatal]
Fatal is merciful and they curse me
When I grip the mic I show no mercy
I got heart, I rip the party apart
From the seams and hem up like bell-bottom jeans
But you get done, 
you get blues like 501
Brothers are live but I bet ya I'm liver son
So let me get upon the scene and redeem
The dream of a team, 
and knock 'em out like Mitch Green
Smoke some thai weed, flow at a high speed
Rap on off breaks stomping like Northlakes
Cause I'm living larger than the founders of Fendi
An Asiatic brother that many rappers envy
So round up your crew and entourage
And let the God Merciful just take charge
[Hook]
[Akinyele]
Some of them said (said what?) that the Ak should quit
But I don't sweat it, cause I'm too big for that small shit
Like pigs when it comes to a showdown
Huff and puff but the Ak won't get blown down
Cause I come strong, rather than come at all and not be ready
That's what separates me from the petty
MC's gas themselves by drinking too much Getty
And get torn the fuck up like confetti
I'm rich and thick in lyrics like Aunt Jemima
It doesn't take Keenan Ivory Wayans to know that I'mma
Get you sucker
 
if you bite like a piranha
So save them preschool rhymes for the kids at Wonderama
Point blank, period, with no comma
Rhymes so dangerous, 
call for the homicide
Cause I knock 'em dead even when I'm at my worst
The only future that lies ahead of them is the lights from the hearse
Got game like a crackhead
But don't be misled, I keep rappers on lock like a dread
Knots in the head from the words that I said
So get a shovel and dig your grave cause the shit you talk is dead
[Hook]
[Large Professor]
I grab up girls like jacks
Add 'em on like tax, and I'm over like 
Hot Trax
As far as brothers are concerned a pressure cooker from start
To finish I diminish like a Cuisinart
Secondly, I'm sick of critics, who's necking me
(
Oooh he got an afro
) yo, but I got dough
Why's my name the Large Professor?
Cause I milked your cow in other words I hit your heifer
Don't talk about how you can break Rambo
That's just a bunch of mamba-ja-hambo
Propaganda, save it for Savanda
Joe and Amanda, Zach and Alexandra
Don't let the folks around your way puff your head
Cause you'll be the owner of a hospital bed
I'll kick fire out your ass so fast
You'll be as crispy as my man Bill Blass
[Hook x4]

Yo, this is Nas with my Man DJ Clue
The Professional part two
Puttin' it down for you fake ass DJ's and shit like that
Straight outta Q.B. all the way around the fuckin' world
Black Frank Sinatra on yo' ass
Q.B. Braveheart nigga...
[Verse 1]
Was classified as the bastard who died
Rumors say I came back alive with an axe
And attacked niggas actin' like Nas
My passion is to capitalize
Come through my hood you get jacked for your ride
Catch you from the passengers side
My words turn the sea red
Like the eyes of a weed head
Ya'll peep my led then hide like Easter eggs
I ride 'till the beef is dead, caskets dropped
Your soul go further up than astronauts
I talk it and live it
Ya'll weak dudes should offer forgiveness
Cause frontin' like you ill gets yourself torchered by killers
In Newyork I'm the realest
Predicted by fortune tellers
Sick with the talkin' methods
AK's, Berettas
My whole team is Steelers like Jerome Bettis
Ramming niggers' like Saint Louis, we're dough-getters'
And ya'll niggas is losers, nothin' fuckin' with us
Nothin' but Bravehearts gon' hustle wit' us
Ugh!
[Verse 2]
When ya'll niggas fall
And start makin' 800 collect call commercials like Arsenio Hall
I'm on Times Square on New Years with Dick Clark dropping the ball
With Kool and the Gang, doin' my thing
Princess cut chains
I bend bitches like bike frames
My tight game will make Hilary leave Bill quick as lightning
I'll have her wearin' tight jeans
Givin' nice brains in a white Range
Pullin' up to club life, turned her to a thug life dame
I'm saying, you're rolling with Nastradamus
We flowin' to St. Thomas
Jewelry box full of stones so I can change diamonds
Matchin' masterpieces on black sandy beaches
Even the paparazzi tries to peep us
Disguised with dark shades and fake beards
A lucky photographer noticed Tyra Banks here
But I showed the tabloids bogus passports
I told 'em back off before I flip like Castor Troy
[Verse 3]
Live from the Bridge, cliques stay high from the iz'
Wear the most popular shit, niggas knockin' my shit
Denali's, fat designed rims, 2000 S Benz
Watchin' ESPN with two dime lesbians
I hit it of course, I did it to floss
The last Don, doin' hits like Pepe and Cross
Esco, cash long, niggas think I'm Blacula
Cause I'm in a castle with a bitch cold waxin' her
I leave my teeth marks in hoes, scoop 'em like a spatula
Pass 'em to my peoples and party like a Bachelor
'till I meet a gangsta bitch, give her banks to hit
In return all she wants to do is drink the dick
Fuck street clothes, we thug it out in Tuxedos
Stomp niggas with hard bottoms in casinos
A Hundred Bravehearts vest' up, nigga reload
We keep low, Hundred Thousand bank ceelo

Yo NYC, U-N-I-verse, se-riously

Monopolize, strategies of war,
 exercise, mega
Got word back from Noreaga
The D.A. got video cassette taper
The god with the 
God-U-Now
, 
pullin a caper
Runnin up in the spot, mask and duct taped up
Pig tied they motherfuckin wrists to they ankles
I been through, crime shit my niggas in-to
Peep the issue situation like this
, 
we stickin him too
JFK
 
on our way to L.A
Got links with big cats down to Santa Barbre (Barbara)
My crew do it the Mobb way, everyday
Crime pay, who wanted gunplay? Drill me
Niggas kill me, 
grillin me
, you wanna look?
Peep the nine milli, now undress, you know the drill-y
Niggas suspect, weak links pose threats
, 
I have yet
To met challenger who go against my set
Gem stars razor sharp like Gilette, shavin closely on
Any character approach me
I let the streets get the best of me, infamy, my destiny
While cat burg-lars tryin to sneak peep the recipe
Inside my rap cookbook, paragraphs is gourmet
You pay about $5,000 a plate
[Verse 2: Havoc]
No doubt kid, I hit them niggas like a
 
bid
The prosecutor, runnin up in your crib
Do your dirt, 
I do my dirt all by my lonely
It's only me, and the 
gat
 that's 
holdin me
We got it locked beyond measure, the click's under pressure
Extort you for your treasure smack you with the undresser
Represent your click, go ahead, get that ass whipped
(
Floatin in the river with your body wrapped in plastic
)
Wannabe thug, get smacked for back talkin
QB
 represent fuck that, it can happen
While you rappin, I'm busy tryin to sneak the gat in
Contamin(ate), cut the party short while you jammin
We think smarter, reach harder,
 got the

Bodyguard of somethin you don't want a part of
If I was you, then I would do what I have to
But you ain't me
, 
you hesitated so I clapped you
Then stepped off casually, naturally me
[Verse 3: Nas]
Niggas thinkin shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder clicks meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean
, 
projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on a phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600,
 
you just a crumb inside a world
Where the rich run it
, 
curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome
, 
niggas mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock or swerve on it
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Aire lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than El DeBarge's
Catchin charges, of marksmen, livin heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin
, puttin niggas in 
mausoleums
From Queens cross the Throgs Neck, heads bop, I see 'em
[Hook: Prodigy (3X)]
For niggas don't know how to act
To all my niggas on the block slangin crack
Rest in peace to my niggas layin on they back
To all the niggas who bust gats (live nigga rap)
[H] If you's a live nigga

[Hook]
Live now niggas, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro
[Nas]
Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, 
why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I shot pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid
, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga
[Hook]
[Scarlett]
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
God, I respect you cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, 
held me down after
 
Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, "Me a victim?", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggas I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggas, rich niggas, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now
[Hook: Scarlett]
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
Cause I promise you you'll regret it bro
[Scarlett]
Son, come close, lemme talk to you
I got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it
Look out for little me, one

Welcome to the house of pain, Just Blaze niggas
[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
There's no way out, it seems I can't get free
Somebody tell me what's happening to me
[Verse 1: Notorious B.I.G.]
The country bud got me chokin'
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smokin'
Yea that sick nigga Biggie wit the 8-shot fifth
Wit the extra clip for that extra shit
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling
All the blood spilling, is all a part of drug dealing
A born gangsta my daddy was a thug
Had a .38 wit the hollow point slug
So when he lit shots, niggas dropped
Quicker than a bootlegger sells his liquor
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes
Payin' dues, while kids was on their one's and two's
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster
Got the Mac 11 swingin' from my shoulder
It's a damn shame I got to put my momma through the strain
I'm livin' in a house of pain
[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
Is anybody listenin' and tell me can you can see this darkness surrounding me
Now it's gettin' colder heavy on my shoulder and it's gettin' hard to breathe
Visions gettin' blurry, I'm gettin' worried cause it's gettin' hard to see
When your livin' in the house of pain
[Verse 2: 2Pac]
The motherfuckin' dust kicker, who can you trust?
Do you have the heart to see a nigga before you bust?
My name is spoken on the tongues of so many foes
Bustin' motherfuckers out the blocks and I ain't even go
Now how the hell do you explain my claim to fame?
From doin' flicks to bustin' tricks out the fuckin' frame
Got these bitches on my jock, niggas on my block
Jealous ass suckers got em duckin' from my smokin' Glock
And bustin' niggas asses is to stay alive
Skinny ass playa watchin' bigger motherfuckers fry
They ask me how I'm livin', I'm a hustler
Buckin' busters 'til they die
Now it's on in the ghetto you ain't heard?
Niggas got they AK's headin' for the burbs
Aimin' at them skin headed bitches let it rain
Givin' 'em a wet, welcome to the house of pain
[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
[Verse 3: Nas]
MJB
, 
be worried niggas, yea,
 Nas
Wendy Williams say I stayed dusted maybe I should
Cuz these rappers'll have your phone tapped like Savion Glover
And on the West, yo, police corrupt, some are bloods
But these Teflons I loaded explodin' some mugs
I'm like Furious in "Boyz n the Hood"
But at the drive through I ain't runnin' I'm dumpin'
Crazy like a Piru
 and locc'd up, know how Nas do
I'm callin' Henchmen and Conception, to organize a black truce
And we party hard, party wit Nas
Since they ain't no more - Mardi Gras
And Bush won't apologize
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize
Ya'll yellin' my name but y'all soon dyin'
Tryin' to portray real but they be ly-in
Cuz they want the real niggas to die so they can gain
But never that, this ain't Everlast, this the House of Pain
[Hook: Mary J. Blige]

[Intro : Akon]
Im steady tryin' to find a motive
Why do what i do?
Freedom ain't gettin no closer
No matter how far i go
My car is stolen, no registration
Cops patrolin
And now they done stopped me, and I get locked up
[Chorus]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (im locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
[Verse 1 : Nas]
What's up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should've slid to my crib
Fuck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son?
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs all the dime
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What's up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove one what? One love
[Verse 2 : Akon]
Headin up town to re-up
Back with a couple keys
The corner blocks on fire
Undercovers dressed as fiends
Makin so much money
Products moving fast
Put away the stash
And as I sold the last bag I fucked around and got locked up
[Chorus]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out (I got locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (baby girl I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
[Verse 3 : Akon]
Cuz visitation no longer comes by
Seems like they forgot about me
Commissary is getting empty
Cell mates getting food without me
Can't wait to get out and move forward with my life
Got a family that loves me and wants me to do right
But instead I'm here locked up
[Chorous]
They won't let me out, they won't let me out
(ohhh I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
(my nigga I'm locked up)
They won't let me out, they won't let me out (I'm locked up)
They won't let me out no, they won't let me out
[Verse 4 : Nas]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' something word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm gonna put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reels, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it lowkey
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies, I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love
[Outro : Akon]
Pay me a visit (they won't let me out)
Send me some magazines (they won't let me out)
Send me some money orders (they won't let me out, no)
Pay me a visit, baby (they won't let me out)
Cuz I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Where's my lawyer? (they won't let me out)
I'm locked up, they won't let me out, no
Get me out of here (they won't let me out)
Im locked up (they won't let me out, they won't let me out)
Baby, I'm locked up (they won't let me out, no)
Where's my niggas? On the lock-down
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
I'm locked up, they won't let me out
Ohhh... they won't let me out
Can you please accept my phone calls?
Cuz I'm locked up, locked up, locked up

[Verse 1: AZ]
Visualizing the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as 5 percenters
But somethin' musta got in us cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some rest in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others such as myself are trying to carry on tradition
Keeping this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though, we know somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leaving thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough, so
Until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers, will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keeping it real, packing steel, getting high
Cause life's a bitch and then you die
[Hook: AZ]
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we get high
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die
That's why we puff lye
Cause you never know when you're gonna go
[Bridge 1: Nas]
Times is Illmatic
Times is Illmatic
Times is Illmatic
(Destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it)
[Bridge 2: ?]
You gotta get the ground beneath your feet partner
Get the wind behind your back
Ride the blades of Glory if you got to
Otherwise you ain't shit
You might as well be (?) your damn self
[Verse 2: Nas]
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessing
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some Godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young, at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners, take their wallets, their jewels, and rip their green cards
Dipped to the projects flashing my quick cash and
Got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now I think about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doing years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of saying "fuck tomorrow"
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Times is Illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
I Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
[Hook: AZ]
[Bridge 1: Nas]
[Outro: ?]
Yea, you know the flavor, Nas and AZ on the remix joint
This is another explosion from the awesome
Yes, man

Bravehearts
[Verse 1]
Now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step with
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas, yo
Grey Goose and a whole lotta hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well dressed
With finesse in a white tee,
 
looking for wifey
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive thru the city no doubt
But don't say my car's topless, say the titties is out
Newness here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot with
Push the pool stick in your new crib
Same hand that you hoop with,
 
swing around like you stu-pid
King of the town? Yeah, I been that
You know I click-clack; where you and your mens at?
Do the Smurf, do the Wop,
 
Baseball Bat
Rooftop like we bringing '88 back
[Hook]
They shooting – aw, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Getting big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?
[Verse 2]
This ain't rapping, this is Street Hop
Now get up off your ass, like your seat's hot
My live niggas, lit up the reefer
Trunk of the car, we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none, no reason for your mans
To panic, you don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all the tension
Baller convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers can move swift
Girls get close, you can feel where the tool's kept
All my just-coming homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phoney
Pull out my waist, the eagle four-forty
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I see niggas running, yo, my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk asses
Like Pun said, you ain't even en mi clasa
Maybach Benz, back seat, TV plasma
Ladies looking for
 
athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is,
 show me love
Let me feel how the head is
Females whose the sexiest is always the nastiest
[Outro]
And I like a 
little sassiness,
 
a lotta class
Mommy reach in your bag,
 
pass the fifth
I'm a leader at last, this a don you with
My nines'll spit, niggas lose consciousness

Commissioner Steve Stoute, Lenny - ha!

Bravehearts

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yo ain't nothing but trouble God
When I kick in the door
 with D-Block, Bravehearts and the 
Double R
Don't make me let the machine off
This is methadone music that you can lean off
"Made You Look," the remix with me up on it
I copped your shit, now I break weed up on it
And everything is real I see
Like my niggas that been home but they only got a jail ID
I helped the game, it ain't help me
I'm top five dead or alive and that's just off one LP
And, I still buzz, they feel cuz
Cause they know the flow's Ill just like Will was
I'm just tryin to make sure that my sons wealthy
Out of shape but I make sure that my guns healthy
I'm a ape, you can't stand 'Kiss
Comin through the hood in a 
Aston Vanquish the color of dandruff
They said we jumped him, I just let the gun snuff him
Copped P then turboed soon as they uncuff him
This goes out to all of your mans
Why put you in the verse when I can put in a coroner van
D-Block
[Hook - Nas]
They shooting! Ah, made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin big money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangsters? Where them dimes at?
[Verse 2: Ludacris]
I'm from the school of hard knocks, sneak peeks and low blows
Where X's mark spots and kitchens mark O's
Where love is gon' getcha and hate is gon' snitch ya
And fingers squeeze triggers like boa constrictors
It's the, Mr. Luda, Jada and Nas
And our bullets give you a deep tissue massage
So hear a song and dance 
while I make these ends
You never stood half a chance like Siamese Twins
Ah, they shooting, look in the barrel
Then he made the front page of the Miami Herald
Or Chi. Tribune
, 
nozzles with silent doom
We in that A-Town Journal as violent goons
You should print my information, quote my rhyme
And keep me in between these New York and L.A. Times
I was the victim of society, it's 'Cris the menace
With mo' shit out on the streets than evicted tenants
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, I grasp the ratchet, the blinker, the biscuit, the burner
The heat, the toaster, the twister you meetin your owner
The banger, the hammer, the flamers I aim at the cannons
And can ya, manhandlin ya, you'll be famous I'll cancel you
And cut, that's the end of your movie
Pretendin you actin like you and your mens'll come shoot me
My tennis shoes 
Gucci
, old school pea soup green
Jean Lee suit on, Veuve Clicquot champagne
Friday the 13th
 my CD drop, 
I rhyme to more Base than EZ Rock
I'm 
Jason
, call up P.D. watch
Them Bravehearts, Jungle and Wiz and Nashawn
Ill Will rasta Lake
, never revealin his face on
TV or pictures or even them niggas
Sorry that I made you wait long, glad them fakes gone
We shooting! Squeezing them triggers with Luda beside me
Me and 'Kiss get Luniz of weed, set to Styles P
Tell him hold his head, God's Son got him we made y'all look
From San Quentin to Rikers Island to

[Nas]
Laced and Macy's don't have it, a hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wastin' fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-muggin' on my clean-thuggin' mean nothin'
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writing Russian,
 
ice disgusting
I started bling, how could you question my direction?
Or my Tom Ford collection
Gangstas two-steppin'
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all living trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we ridin' heavy
N.Y. to Miami, cause, we make the world go round
[Nas] (Chris Brown)
Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us
(We make the world go round)
[The Game]
I see the haters on the floor jockin' my swag
I'm poppin' Ralph Lauren tags and pourin' champagne inside a polo glass
Model bitches rollin' grass
, 
Escobar unfoldin' cash
Toastin' with my entourage, went from robbin' armored cars
To all my stars, red carpet to the L'Ermitage
We throwin' red dice at the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage
Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad
(We the best)
, 
big pimpin', top down chrome spinnin'
Top Gun, Tom Cruise tucked inside my Gucci linen
No [censored], just Romo
You tryin' to shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson that's so-so
Nick want his baby back but thats Loso
Tell Hawaii 5-0 to catch me at the Pro Bowl
On the field, diamonds choking the jockey on my polo
CB let em know though
[Nas] (Chris Brown)
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas

Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers

And tell the ballers pour glass for all us

[Chris Brown]
We make the world go round
From my town to your town
We on top, no stoppin' us now
We got patron, the ballers two steppin'
Ladies on the float, and all 'em two steppin'
From L.A. to Harlem, two steppin'
So iced out cause we need to put them haters out
[Nas]
We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a hundred cash shoppin'
Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up
Prefer pea snaps, Perrier-Jouet, a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens;
 I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss
, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seein' me is like seein' through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light
Flashin'
And I'm laughin', my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum, but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what

Now let's toast to the hustlers

Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas

Tell them gangstas, toast to the ballers

And tell the ballers pour glass for all us

[Hook]
A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his ones
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect
In case y'all niggas got to get murdered
A Mastermind - Sleeps at night real easy
A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book
A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational
Lives forever, these tales are classical
[Nas]
Velvet bow ties, bulletproofs in the tux, when I roll by
In a car similar to Osama's,
 
in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggas ran
They was amateurs in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, you'll never lose man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my Masterminds
[Hook]
[Nas]
It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you lame
And I'm nice on that 
black stone merlot
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Weather below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, "drive home"
Cause she the wife 
and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said "Goodbye"
With niggas who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards in my Denali truck
Knowing that I'm surrounded by OGs that I don't really get down with
They got a separate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggas could link
I knew, they kill hoes too like Rae Carruth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga Sonny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switched that
Now I'm strong with niggas who feel Sonny was wrong
My money's long, his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gonna be
But I'm a Mastermind
[Hook]
[Nas]
I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myself, my niggas will slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
Feds, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King Of New York shit only last 15 minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brilliant,
 came in and killed it
Made millions every three months, new jury
I'm low, 
smoking blueberry
 with a ho
That know a few scary individuals, eerie as she get into it
Squares, they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary, then she said she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too
[Hook]

[Hook: John Legend]
Look how far we came
Through the fire, I stood knowing we would reign
Feels like yesterday when all this was a dream
Through these Maybach curtains I see how life has changed
[Intro: Meek Mill]
I think I'mma dedicate this one
To all the people that thought I wouldn't make it here
Dreamchasers
[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, it was all a dream
On the corner servin' all them fiends
Me and a bunch of my niggas, yeah, we was all a team
The system labeled us killas, but momma called us kings
Walked through the hall of a prison, now it's the hall of fame
And people got the nerve to ask why I wear all these chains
When I was booked, they had me shackled to the wall of shame
So I'm just representin', better yet just reminiscin'
Put down on that Bentley truck, I used to want the Expedition
Now it's bigger things, grew up and got bigger dreams
Cause in my hood, niggas try to smoke you just like nicotine
And this money shit ain't funny,
 
all the shit it brings
You bound to lose your family and your friends, boy this shit is mean
And birthdays was the worst days
Last week I made a hundred on a Thursday
And Club Liv got me sinnin' on a church day
Stevie J all on the mic, he screamin' out my birthplace
Philly, we back!
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
I'm blunted - You wanna see life's meaning?
On the radio, Al Green, while Mom's cleanin'
Mom's singing along with the songs
And shortly I learned the words to 'em
Nerf balls, I threw 'em
But now I'm a perfectionist to a fault like Jesus
Judgin' his own miracles, but he won't cause he automatic
I'm like an old blues singer living in the bottle
Whose wife left him down in the bottom
Writing songs is how we solvin' the problem
My liquid money's a hypnotist to your Mrs
Lay back like I'm in the chair of a dentist
Nasir relentless, a freak like Prince is
Mystique like Sade
Soon as I enter people, point and see my anointment
I ain't tryna do too much
Same time, I ain't no bum nigga not doin' enough
But I ain't tryna do no dumb shit, chasin' my tail in a circle
I made it so I'm chillin' now
Transparent ceiling now
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
The chorus cinematic, going back to Cali
Young street nigga, late 80's suede Bally's
Jewels like Rick the Ruler, looking like I ripped the jeweler
I could cut a check, make some people hit your shooter
Domino effect, you in that magic city
Where all they do is flex; call it Milli Vanilli
Coming from the bottom, my lil' nigga from Philly
Young legend outta Queens, take over city to city
Honor thy mother, go to war for my brother
Giving sufficient funds to significant others
Went from poor now women screamin' for my signature
More war came from the bottom so I know the war
Never worn, always on, y'all niggas luke warm
Talking cash over salads, heavy croûtons
Cuban links equivalent to having suits on
Stretch Maybachs 'til they bring the coupes on
[Hook]

(Check check)
A'ight fuck that shit, word word, fuck that other shit, y'know what I'm sayin? 
We gonna do a lil sum like this
, y'know what I'm sayin?

Keep it on and on and on and on-in
. Know'm sayin, Big Nas, Grand Wizard, what is it. Ha-ha it's like
You know what I'm sayin. Yo go head and rip that shit dun
[Verse 1]
I rap for listeners, bluntheads, fly ladies and prisoners
Henessey-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissing
A unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-er
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Chocolate blunts make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, the times of white lines
The hype pipes
, 
murderous nighttimes and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap
With my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas
 
no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rolling mats for craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, I roll a deuce, nothing below
 
(Peace God!)
Peace God -- now the shit is explained
I'm taking niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that y'all
[Hook]
"Now let me take a trip down memory lane"
"Coming outta Queensbridge"
[Verse 2]
One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate,
 
my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blown, black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro,
 dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets
, hustling brothers who keep the same rank
Pumping for something, some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hanging niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
Fuck "rap is real", watch the herbs stand still
Never talking to snakes cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane
[Hook x4]

Skills provide the shows, also fright the foes
And when I step into a room, pimps hide they hoes
"Is that really him?" "Yes, that's his Highness
And for the last time stop looking at his fine ass"
(Y'know!) Homosexuals, smirk, converse and say
"That nigga box is WORKING girlfriend!"
You wanna talk about a fat phrase carrier
To billionaire white chick jump the race barrier?
You know a nice girl, but I didn't want a bit of her
Sayin, "I like your slang what's with the wife, get rid of her"
Son, Sony talking Japanese
With mice like, "Whattup Rick? You can have my cheese kid"
I am such a heavy hitter
Even chandelier jealous off the patch ice glitter (bling!)
Rappers walking round, strapping fearsome, HERE SON
And remember your rap career's done
Finally, a change from these fake rap artists
[Rick] Me and Nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, real niggas that are Billboard charters
[Rick] Me and Nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, we'll separate the men from the heartless
[Rick] Me and Nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, a tag team from the top all-starters
[Rick] Me and Nas bring it to your hardest
[Nas]
Runnin spots, pants leg tucked in my socks
Puff and lay a spread, order drinks, Henn on the rocks
Wintertime sport a fox, maybe a sable
Three-quarter length mink sound right for this occasion
Heard me John Blazin, see me in gangster flicks
Life is so amazing, hate to be paperless
Bill Gate in this, it must be God, I'm not a atheist
Wanted like kingpins by ATF
Your girl want my name on her chest
Me and Rick argue about whose chain is the best
Gucci boxers, my diet changed from sushi to pastas
Wear my hat like the late Sinatra's
Models pop the coochie when the spot us
Finally rappers you could be proud of, from the Bronx
To Queensbridge Houses WHAT? If you feel me then holla
Thug niggas, who bail be worth a million dollars, what
Finally, a change from these fake rap artists
[Rick] Me and Nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, real niggas that are Billboard charters
[Rick] Me and Nas bring it to your hardest
Finally, we'll separate the men from the heartless

But you don't owe her no favours
But her respect is due

All the heartache I go through (If I had it all)
It's for you

Cops keep firing in my environment
Middle finger to the law nigger gripping my balls

I like to see them fall, guilty for doing wrong
Middle finger to the law nigger gripping my balls

Now all you hypocrites, witness the injustice
Conversations taped illegally, then they cuff us
U.S. attorneys, 
 send us off to hard prison time
Whether you innocent or did the crime
Say you come from ?? pursue your heart
Run your place, put guns in your face
Put you in the coff' for nothing
Now your strugglin', tied up, standing in line-ups
Call your lawyer, they charged you with murder
Why? Coz these liars said you shot another man on his driveway
Guilty, just for being black on a Friday
 your feelings, because your nervous
Charged for murder you didn't commit, then they serve ya
, 
Slashing, stab wounds, 
 injuries
You were placed there intentionally
Either you bang or you miss me, listen to me

When do we stop playing?
When do we stop pimping and start spraying?
Taking shots for every cop that popped Shaun Bell
His body laying but they all quit
Because they know that our generation won't do shit!
Nothing, nada
But every rapper is a shotter or a Don Dodder
Or a killer, but you ain't killing nothing
And it's peace unless it's another nigger
Tryna raise boys to Superman
And while i'm at it fuck Poppa Jay Cooperman
It's never justice for blacks but they sin just us to our right
With grown whites and latinos
I pray to God that you hear this single
This is Banner's 
 y'all
[Hook]
[Outro]
You still want to be nigger too?

[Nashawn]
Ayo, I'm yappin' these jewels
Clappin' these dudes
A straight born Killa
It's Q.B. Borough nigga, untamed Gorillas
Niggas that put holes in squealers
Dope dealers, I see police flashin' through my rearview mirror
Put the brick in my waist, tighten my belt
Safety off the Nine, they gotta kill me for mine
I'm flaotin', left lane open where I could get through
The cop blazed the pistol, busted out my back window
I skidded out, now I'm outta control
Slammed on the break and shot out the rear do'
I'm hearin' ambulance sirens, I kept firin'
It's gotta be them cause I ain't dyin'
I'm bonin' out
Bit the top off a Guiness stoute
Pour some out, Bravehearts no doubt
I glove niggas, uppercut thug niggas
Look at my mug, you can tell that I'm bugged niggas
Chorus - Why it feel good to be real and reveal who's fake? Why ya'll
Niggas got the girly mouth? Why we feel great? Why ya'll look mad with a
Frowned face? Why the hoes love The Gods, Bbravehearts, Nas, and Nash?
Why them Bravehearts roll hard with Nickel plates? With big slugs that
Can't be traced, and why ya'll look so corny tryin' to imitate these
Real niggas that'll punch you in your face?
[Nas]
I saw niggas get smacked and have the street thinkin' they real
Saw niggas wives and knew 'em as the cum drinkin' girls
Hosaditty, she act like she innocent
She act like her Pussy is place that no nigga been
Why she act like she never met me?
She can't forget me
Thugs respect me, jealous niggas say F me
Cause my cruise shots like Lefty and Sunny Black
Your Hoes wanna lick Honey out my crack
I'll fart in your bitch mouth, she call me psychic
Cause I knew she would like it
Push fleetwood Caddy's feelin' righteous
I eat good, no red meat I like Fish
Ya'll never in your life seen money
I live like a Gangster from the Nineteen Twenties
Smuggle bootleg liquor
I shoot 'till you dead nigga
I'm about bread, these rhymes is off the head nigga
Wear Esco leathers and Esco fleece
I could flow over techno beats and rep the streets
You a one verse assasin
I'm a multiple LP long lastin'
Peekin' again
Grimy nigga with different color ink in my skin
Former low life, now I'm the Bling Bling King
Respect it
See me with the shit I say on record
Not like these fake thugs, please wake up
If I die I'm'a rise from the grave
With two Four-Fives and maggots in my eyes to make niggas pay!

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Eyes must be wide shut
Liquor got you open, closing your blinders
Just in case you need a friendly reminder
Let me take this bullet, bullet out my head
Change your body, need a visor
Car too big, but fuck it, don't need a driver
All me want is a girl who'll be a rider
Can't believe pull it, pull it
Nigga gun, gun down
[Bridge]
She want me to hold her, hold her down
Sorry boo boo, you gets no love, no love now
Must be coo coo, got me fucked up, fucked up, wow
You know a nigga ain't goin' hold ya, hold ya down
[Hook]
I'm a mirage (Fuck I look like?)
I'm a mirage (What the fuck I look like?)
It's all in your mind, your mind (Fuck I look like?)
Open your eyes, you're blind (What the fuck I look like?)
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Yeah girl, your mind should apologize to ya
Keep on tellin' all of those 
crazy
 lies to ya
You believe 'em, I don't wanna accept the truth
Who the fuck you kiddin', kiddin', what's the use?
Sad to see you playing the fool
You don't know half the shit that a nigga been through
I guess you got your reward, reward for it
You actin' like you don't need me, baby
[Bridge]
Excuse my French but...
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
You lookin' for love, and I'm the one you imagine
With athlete money from just rappin'
My body wrapped in some Valentino, Laurel Piano fashion
Sex with passion, romancin', laughin'
Happiness, action, restaurants, relaxin'
They got some good sushi in Aspen, that good pussy I'm smashin'
I call you Matsuhisa, yeah I'm your Visa
American Express, I must confess
I'm tryna go beyond love, and this is hard to translate
Love is good, but to me, good is just the enemy of great
You wanna make it to the top, but you don't got what it take
To be a model, actress, singer, stripper
Want me to help you to become a star, you was my sister
You was my soldier, damn, I used to miss ya
I used to love ya, I think to hold ya
You didn't know me, it was only just a mirage
[Hook: Chris Brown]

[Intro]
42nd street terminal
[Verse 1]
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big money and the most
Uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic
Nothing is figurative
I can wish it into existence
God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread
I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas
Why argue niggas
The truth is the truth
I really put my scars on niggas
They wear them lifetime, they tell they hoes, Nas did this
Pointing to they scars like
Right here, baby, really Nas did this
Like a badge of honor, not bragging I'm just honest
War stories we tell them
, 
nothing's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Dempsey,
 
matte black Bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, 
passing round the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
Fuck your ice
I rock rubies, amethyst
I'll fuck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous
[Break: Large Professor]
Yo, what we talking bout niggas
What we talking bout niggas
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what recollect fucker
[Verse 2: Nas]
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand living in public housing
Integrity intact, repping hard
They asking how he disappear and reappear back on top
Saying Nas must have naked pictures of God or something
To keep winning is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathing, I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smiling, I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump being up down up, play with cash
[Break: Large Professor]
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge
 
to Bushwick
Harlem
Bronx
All that
You ain't even supposed to be here
You know where you at
[Verse 3]
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hanging from the roof of my mouth
Shit was felicissimo melting pot, city sweltering hot
Staggering, drunker than those cops that 2Pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reaching, soon as I heard them iron wheels screeching
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Token man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor thief shit, minor league shit, beasting
Looking for the juks young, but now we older chiefing
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Bugging on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alcohol aging my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I
Must be, something in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all
[
Outro

This for my trapped in the 90s niggas
For my trapped in the 90s niggas
Ha for y'all niggas

[Intro]
We bigger than the Jews..
Bigger than the Irish..
You can run the whole fuckin country!
YOU could be the next John D. Rockerfeller
"Nobody noticed us, nobody gave a shit..
But the bigger we get
The more we're TAKING from other people.."
[Nas]
Yo, in a mahogany, black scenery, that was lightning and rain drops
I'm tied up in the basement cocaine spot like Bangkok
I'm blindfold, Vietnam type mind control this torture
His accent sounds like the rarest culture
Askin me, my atrophy stabbin me gradually
Says his attribute, was satanic, masonic, ironic
I felt reminded of my fast life ventures
And winters
, 
blinded til the flashlight enters
[AZ]
Yo Dunn, before the sun set call connect get all the tech's
I'm vexed, this nigga soft as sex, lost respect, let's off his neck
My calibre, got me thinkin on a higher algebra
See me I'm just as foul as ya but you ain't got no style in ya
I'm into bigger cheddar, G's and better, Armarett-ah's
Armani sweaters,
 
plus these crabs could never dead us
Chorus: AZ (repeat 2X)
Mo money, mo murder, mo homicide
You catch that body nigga, better have that alibi
You never know it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, (now) watch that suicide
[AZ]
Now government official, got you sippin Cristal in crystal
You fish you foul so you fell and took your fam witchu
I'm out to get you, guaranteed every shell'll hit you
Plus 
I'm on some shit too
, 
layin down whose-ever witchu
Mafiosa,
 the New York City 
90's era Sosa
AZ, you know my culture, now my wolves is out to ghost ya
[Nas]
Scent of a rose on the graveyard for real now
The stakes is up a half a mil now
I 
tried to grab him with his shield down
Four walked in, they're crazy paid up
Sharp but straight up
Gators from Barbados, never seen nobody play those
Lay-Low's what they called him, his head baldin
Sippin cappucino, spilled on his silk suits, was scaldin
Laugh was vulgar, 
canvas paintings of the Ayatollah
And on his arm he wore a priceless vulture
Tobacco pipe smoker,
 
Escobar your life is over
Justify the righteous nova
, 
bullets flew out his right shoulder
Corpse leavin a foul odor
The Firm Volume 1 adjourned, bring it to a closure
Chorus
[Nas]
So now you're rollin wit us
Like co-defendents,
 no phony business
So know the difference - from supreme solo
It's the styles ancient as Moses scriptures
It's Latin Kings, Black Kufis, and White Justice, amongst us
Crime invades the minds of youngsters
Where it's pitch black they can't see you
Godfather 3, fallin for dead, in a cathedral
[AZ]
Now you're forced to listen, 
I got the mind of a grad from Princeton
Play your position, or soon you'll be lost and missin
It's far from fiction, 
my presence is like that of a christian
With ammunition puttin states under submission
Street addiction, got me tied in thorough with boroughs
Still in the ghetto, but in the cut where it's mellow
Incognito, on the lee-low, like Carlito
Cause we know, niggas don't really want us to see doe
You never know it might just be yo' time you take yo' ride
To them pearly white gates, watch that suicide
Chorus 2X
[Nas]
Homicide, mo homicide
Mo suicide, mo homicide..
{*music fades*}
{*untitled 1:18 length song starts*}
Born alone, die alone.. {repeat 4X}
[AZ]
All alone in this wilderness
Who can figure life as ill as this?
My vision's blurred from guerilla's mist
Gun sprays, trey's left a portion of my crew in graves
Niggas that would screw in ways unknown to these dudes today
Intelligence, kept us all away from state evidence
Cause it's evident, this world is controlled on dead presidents
Never hesitant, I'm soulless, filled with coldness
Born to uphold this til I'm left dead from oldness
Born alone, die alone.. {repeat 6X to fade}

[Intro - Kissing]
I love you so much, don't ever leave me, I won't let you leave
[Verse 1]
The ho turned me out
, 
green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I ain't gonna lose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I dont know how to act
When she not around, Im heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted
, 
she got me trapped
[Hook]
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I can't be rich
[Verse 2]
All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
It's so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
I'm a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when I'm not with you, I'm off guard
Niggas always expect to see us two together, stable
The best couple they seen since 
Trump and Marla Maple
Don't need no pre-nup
Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a dollar sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, 
slingin' all night long, fiendin' to stroke ya
Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you,
 
heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I won't sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you
Before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm wit you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
It's hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I liked you better when you were illegal
But you had to get professional
Musical
Now when we fuck we use prophylactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's,
 
limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxury, when I asked it
Fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya assets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

[Verse 1: Nas]
My niggas got scarred grills
Skully hats and gats be fullys
Brrrat, cars peel, the East Coast cartel
Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors
Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards gettin' sprayed up
Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up
Even if they indicted Jacob
Forensics, Paramedics carry cowards off
Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
They die and hit Hell from an iron
I'm flyin', wire or cell, I'm paid from this shit
Got bitches high as hell, 
and they fuckin' like AIDS don't exist
They get sent to your hotel, a maid and shit
Put a barrel in a capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about
King poetic
, too many haters to count
Too much paper to count, 
QB
 BITCH!
[Hook: Nas]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
Money Over Bullshit
, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
+Money Over Bullshit+, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
[Verse 2: Nas]
Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet
Thinkin' about which nigga to target
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no Martyrs
Black Tech
 on the table, 
Mag .44
Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door
Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar
You niggas fish-made, y'all niggas is fifth grade
Niggas, it's fifty ways to disect the General
If I give ya the top five, you will not survive
Rule 1: cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue
Rule 2: thought ya knew don't fuck with God's Son
Rule 3: see, matter fact, I just wait
If y'all reach top five, then I'mma eat y'all alive
Each one of you guys that claim Hip-Hop is still alive
Like y'all ain't in agreement wit Nas
That shit is dead motha'fucka, it's dead bitch
[Hook: Nas]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
+Money Over Bullshit+, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
+Money Over Bullshit+, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
[Verse 3: Nas]
From crack pushers
 
to Lac' pushers
 and ambushers
And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous
From nickel and dimin; to trickin; them diamonds
Vegas, places in Switzerland
From non-blastin; to auto, I don't have to blast mine
They blast mine, black nine, you flatline
My cash climb, buy rare art
Antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases
Five-star restaurant eaters; don't forget who your peeps is
'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
Only if they grind with you - or slang for ya
Seen niggas live, laugh, party, and die in that very same corner
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
Private planes landed out in Teterboro, 
weed I twirl
Once even gave me a phobia
That I be in a spot trapped like Madame Zenobia's
With this kid eyein' my
 
Rolly
, y'all
[Hook: Nas]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
+Money Over Bullshit+, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
(My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of, ha-ha)
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
+Money Over Bullshit+, pistols over brawn
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
[Outro: Nas]
There it is, QB bitch, yea, QB bitch, yea, yea, QB bitch

[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
I'm trying to put it all in words, but it's
More than I can say
It would take a whole lifetime to tell you
More than I can say
Every time I wrote a line it’s still
More than I can say
This is the realest shit I ever wrote
More than I can say
[Verse 1 - Nas]
Bottles and El Dorados, trapped in the allure
The sickness: dreaming of riches
Reality was the cure.
 
My doctor
Physician was music,
 I'm sure
The prescription was super-model sandwiches
And suicide doors.
 
I used to stand in my mirror
Fixing up my hat right
DMV don't make licenses for the fast life
Was taught never drop my head when I'm doing right
And though I may be watched by feds with the blue sights
I just want the whole world to bop their heads
Someone to stop my bread
If my pops was here, he'd be like
 "son, you the one
They gotta crown you, a gift from around you
Know they don't understand you, but what can they handle?
If they was wearing Gucci loafers, they'd be through, over
Just stay on point, do what you do
Soldier: remember I'm with you when the world get colder..
[Hook - Keyshia Cole]
[Verse 2 - Nas]
Keep having the same dream
About a mic, a gun, a cross, they all
In the middle of flames
An hourglass of salt dripping down to its last grain
Hear a voice that asks what do I claim?
I ask what it means.
 
It's sort of a trance
As the planet Earth appears in the palm of my hands
I could do what I wish with it,
 
and waking up
To study my dreambook, see if it links up
Looking for some significance, like does the dream
Represent this cold world I'm living in?
Ask my man, then his laughter begin
He had the same dream, but in his, he grabbed the gun
Damn son! I told him in mine I took the mic
The cross, I had it all my life, the same height
I'm trying to sneak sleep, so that my mind won't find out
Time out: my body won't wind down

Yea, yea
It started with rhythms I heard listenin' to the wall
The bouncin' of basketballs on playgrounds and all
The empty bottles that's hollow, wind blowin' inside 'em
The flow and the rhymin' got my alignment to a Science
Mixin' with my moms in the kitchen, them spoons rattlin'
Pots and pans, faucet water pourin', tunes managin'
To come from all the fussin' and ramblin'
What I noticed was -- pure music, untampered with
By things show biz does; older thugs showed us stuff
Like how to hold a plug, juice from the street light
It almost could have blowed us up
Crates of records, great sessions had the whole hood jammin'
Large speakers, fresh made, smell the wood sandin'
Father did his blues smooth, legendary jazz man
Saw his wife secondary to his true passion
Started with my crew rappin', new jacks in '82
Never looked back, now look what it changed me to.. music

Through my bass line, I'm livin' through it
Another expression of life, I couldn't live without it
I like my music pure, not watered down
DAMN!, it felt good to fulfill the dreams of gettin' out the hood
Kept me busy, gave me a chance to stop sellin' drugs
Spinnin' time in the basement kept me from actin' up
Zonin' out, wishin' Dre. could check it out
I'm here now, I can't believe it, Proof in the puddin'
Everything happened for a reason
Through this music I'm able to feed the family
When I'm stressed out, it's m

It's a life style, all in the streets and in Hollywood
Music in my DNA, it's my livelihood.. music

Keep the music alive
The good and the strong survive
I closed my eyes and imagined I was 'Jackson Five'
Randy and Michael
 goin' through life cycle
Music alive leader, let life go
So vital to a youngster, comin' up amongst street hustlers
The big be the toucher's, since such a special place
Givin' the ghetto a taste of what freedom is like
I reached a point in my life where I was needin' the mic
No second guessin', self-expression in lessons learned
Aggression, became sessions where sessions burned
Put my soul into it, 'naw my feet is firm
And the game, where name is hard to earn
And hot cat's career gets scared and burn
Through the years, mine took a Godly turn
This is the story of my life here trapped in a verse
No matter the money or the movies, music is first, yea..

[Verse 1] (Nas)
Aiyyo, 
it's packed on this Rikers bus
The tightest cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lasso
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a fuckin' killa
Mother's a dopefiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shorties gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry
Repeat Chorus
[Verse 2] (
Millenium Thug
)
It is I that step up
Me that don't give a fuck, you that foe, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
Fuck a 20-inch, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back
But yo
Repeat Chorus
[Verse 3] (Nas + Millenium Thug)
Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun, shootin' dudes with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
[MT] But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in the system, I'm bout to rebel
[Verse 4] (Millenium Thug)
There's not a bitch in sight
Or block bench, or black gate
Or gray fence
, 
look who fucked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine
, 
at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the newsflash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say
Repeat Chorus
[Nas]
This goes out to Che Guevara;
A Revolutionary destroyed by his country
Just trying to fight for what's real
This goes out to my nigga Malcolm El-Hajj Malik Shabazz
Just trying to fight for what's real
This goes out to Martin, all about peace and destroyed by his own country
This goes out to everybody in the whole world
Just trying to fight for what's real
To Patrice Lumumba;
Just trying to fight for what's real and destroyed by his own people
This goes out to my hood niggas
Coming up everyday just trying to survive the only way we know how
But see we know too much now, and we seen too much now
So ain't nothing gon' to stop us now
To my country, to my country, my country, my country...

[Hook: Joss Stone]
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
My generation will make a change
This generation will make a change
[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Now me love fi see the schoolers them a graduate
A study hard, and save the party for the holidays
Diplomatic with them diploma, and them bound fi great
Because them nah pick up no 'matic, and a perpetrate
And then I love the energies, what them a generate
My Generation it so special, it will make a change
Because the elders sew the seed, and it a germinate
So anytime them see the progress them a celebrate
Because we rising up despite of the economy
And then a we a star the show, like the astronomy
And how we keep on breaking through, is an anomaly
Because we keep remaining true, without apology
The mission have fi carry through and finish properly
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe
, Paris to Napoli
Say Zambia to Honolulu, back to Tripoli
And everybody want a future living happily
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Can you blame my generation? subjected gentrification
Depicting their frustrations, over ill instrumentation
Because music is the way to convey to you what I’m facing
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation
Now if you can’t relate then maybe you are too complacent
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements
Whats up with tomorrow? Will you lead? Will you follow?
Improve your values
, 
education is real power
I reach them like Bono, so get rid of your self sorrow
Add some bravado, 
get wealthy like Wells Fargo
It's truth, that I am you, and I am proof
Surviving through, we do what we gotta do
Yo, we could break the cycle, let nobody lie to you
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school
Because there’s a mission we gotta finish before we leave
This generation is destined to do historic deeds
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
If you weather that storm, then that rain bring sun
Been a long time coming, I know change gone come
Man I got to keep it moving to the beat of my drum
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son
But they thinking that my generation got to die young
If we all come together then they can't divide one
Don’t worry 'bout it; just be about it
Got a message from God: Heaven too crowded
But I say: Hey young world, you never looked better
And I heard change started with man in the mirror
This generation, I’mma represent
A generation led by a black president
Now hows that for change? Who knew that can change?
I don’t even look at the flag the same
, heck
So when you finish reading revelations
Thank God for my generation
[Hook]

[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, be the realest shit I never wrote
I ain't write this by the way nigga, some real shit right here nigga
This'll be the realest shit you ever quote
Let's go!
[Hook: Young Jeezy]
My president is black,
 
my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home, and daddy's still in jail
Tryna make a plate, anybody seen the scale?
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My money's light green
 
and my Jordans' light grey
And they love to see white, now how much you tryna pay?
Let's go!
[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
Today was a good day, hope I have me a great night
I don't know what you fishin' for, catch you a great white
Me, I see great white,
 
heavy as killer whales
I cannot believe this: who knew it came in bales?
Who knew what came with jail? Who knew what came with prison?
Just cause you got opinions, does that make you a politician?
Bush robbed all of us, would that make him a criminal?
And then he cheated in Florida, would that make him a Seminole?
I say and I quote, 
"We need a miracle"
And I say a miracle cause this shit is hysterical
By my nephews and nieces,
 
I will email Jesus
Tell him forward to Moses and CC Allah
Mr. Soul Survivor, guess that make me a Konvict
Be all you can be, now don't that sound like some dumb shit
When you die over crude oil as black as my nigga Bu
It's really a Desert Storm, that's word to my nigga Clue
Catch me in Las Vegas, A.R. Arizona
Rep for them real niggas, I'm winnin' in California
Winnin' in Tennessee, hands down Atlanta
Landslide Alabama, on my way to Savannah
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
I said I woke up this morning, headache this big
Pay all these damn bills, feed all these damn kids
Buy all these school shoes, buy all these school clothes
For some strange reason my son addicted to Polos
Love me some spinach dip, I'm addicted to Houston's
And if the numbers is right I take a trip out to Houston
An earthquake out in China
, 
a hurricane in New Orleans
Street Dreams Tour, I showed my ass in New Orleans
Did it for Soulja Slim, brought out B.G
It's all love Bun, I'm forgivin' you Pimp C
You know how the Pimp be, that nigga gon' speak his mind
If he could speak down from heaven, he'd tell me "stay on my grind"
Tell him: "I'm doing fine".
 
Obama for mankind
We ready for damn change so y'all let the man shine
Stuntin' on Martin Luther,
 
feeling just like a King
Guess this is what he meant when he said that "he had a dream"
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yeah, our history, black history, no president ever did shit for me
Had to hit the streets, had to flip some keys so a nigga won't go broke
Then they put us in jail, now a nigga can't go vote
So I spend dough on these hoes strippin
She ain't a politician, honey's a pole-o-tician
My president is black, 
Rose golden charms
22-inch rims like Hulk Hogan's arms
When thousands of peoples is riled up to see you
That can arouse your ego.
 
We've got mouths to feed, so
Gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from
Cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
No matter how big you can ever be
For whatever fee or publicity, never lose your integrity
For years there's been some prize horses in this stable
Just two albums in, 
I'm the realest nigga on this label
Mr. Black President, yo Obama for real
They gotta put your face on the 5-thousand dollar bill
[Outro: Young Jeezy]
So I’m sittin right here now man
It’s June 3rd haha, 2:08 AM
Nigga I wanna say win, lose or draw
Man we congratulate you already homie
See I motivate the thugs right
You motivate us homie, that’s what it is
This a hands off policy, y'all touch him we ridin nigga
Yeah, first black president, win, lose or draw nigga
Haha, matter of fact, you know what it is man
Shouts out to Jackie Robinson, Booker T. Washington homie
Oh you ain’t think I knew that shit?
Sydney Poitier what they do?
I’m important too though
I was, I was the first nigga to ride through my hood in a Lamborghini

[Hook: 1]
My President is black, my Maybach too
And I'll be God damned if my diamonds ain't blue
My money's dark green and my Porsche is light grey
And I'm headed for D.C, anybody feel me?
[Verse: Jay-Z]
My President is black, in fact he's half-white
So even in a racist mind he's half right
If you have racist mind you'll be a'ight
My President is black but his house is all white
Rosa Parks sat so Martin Luther could walk
Martin Luther walked so Barack Obama could run
Barack Obama ran so all the children could fly
So I'mma spread my wings, you can meet me in the sky
I already got my own clothes, already got my own shoes
I was hot before Barack, imagine what I'm gonna do
Hello Miss America, hey pretty lady
Red, white, and blue flag, wave for me baby
Never thought I'd say this shit, baby I'm good
You can keep your puss, I don't want no more Bush
No more war, no more Iraq
No more white lies, the President is black
[Hook: 1]
[Talking: Young Jeezy]
Yeah, be the realest shit I never wrote
I ain't write this by the way nigga, some real shit right here nigga
This'll be the realest shit you ever quote
Let's go!
[Hook: 2]
My president is black, my Lambo's blue
And I'll be goddamned if my rims ain't too
My mama ain't at home, and daddy's still in jail

Money make the world go round
Money make the world go round
(What? Go money)
Money makes the world go round
TM
Yo, for those who live the way that I live
We came a long way
From wiping coal outta eyelids, to rap's hottest
Fake Gazelles to black Pradas
Selling nicks to trey bags, to making hits like Kidada Jones' father
OG's would send me to the store with a dollar
Hit me with some wise advice for me to follow
Ain't nothing free in the world in life
No matter who you are, everybody got they price
And some cost more than other's
When you poor, it's like life ain't even worth living
But when you rich, it's every fat ass worth hittin'
With no chips, your drawers just stay on your hips
I play with the six cuz money make the whole world spin
But without the Franklin faces, you see who's your real friends
It's V-12's, honeys on the cell, bobbin' out the JBL
It's Nas and R. Kell
[R. Kelly]
Never thought that I'd ever live this life
Money stacked in rolls, honeys on each side
Anything I want, I can say it's mine
No more worries 'bout how can I provide
[KP] Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Nuttin' move but the money)
[R ] You believe it if you want to
[KP] Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Said nuttin' move but the money)
[R. Kelly]
Oh, many say it's wrong cuz I love to spend
Ice in everything countin' Benjamins
All I wanna do try, and let you know
If you don't believe, ask someone who's broke
[KP] Money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Money makes the world go round)
[R ] You believe it if you want to
[KP] Money makes the world go round
[R ] Yes it does
[Nas] (Still nuttin' move but the money)
[R ] Said money makes the world go round
[Nas] (Money make the world go round, what?
Still nuttin' move but the money)
[R ] Nothing but the money
[KP] Money makes the world go round
[R ] Yes it does
[R ] Feels so good, yeah, yeah
[KP] So good, this life I finally live
[R ] And feels so real

[Verse 1]
Word to Will, buried in his Fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors,
 women lose drawers
A true boss, never lose wars, 
got cheddar to floss
Guns under my bed, mask and a flashlight
Living my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mama told me from weed, I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Bopping to the Supremes
, smoking joints
That's cool, but I'mma live how I want
[Hook]
I did it my way
, 
from crumbs and roaches and rats
I did it my way, 
converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, 
from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard
I did it my way, 
to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door
I did it my way, 
never gave a fuck what nobody said
I did it my way, they hope that I fail and wished I was dead
I did it my way, 
if I fucked up it falls on me
I did it my way, I'm lucked up and struck rich, 
now we all can eat
[Verse 2]
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Jacuzzi's, Gucci soap, throwing cash in the air
Though I, still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table,
 
I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get what I got
They think its alot, 
the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not
But I be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped
No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond
I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours
Did he die in vain and represent for the cause
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game, Ya'll can't relate, fuck ya'll
 
(Ill Will)
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies,
 scolding my foes who phony
From blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil
Heron and blow it ruins minds,
 knew a crew one time
'89
, 
they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches, smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, 
I reminisce and remember, sitting on wood benches
Gave me splinters
, just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, moving
I thank the ones who said shorty go home, we about to be shooting
[Hook]

[Intro]
Aiyyo whattup niggas?
Fresh off the honeymoon
The honeymoon's over
Fresh off vaca' (Yeah, yeah)
I'm jet-laggin', still jet-laggin'
But this just a preview
Let's get it on again y'all
[Verse]
I designed it, rhymed it, flow classic
You askin' who am signed with?
The real deal's Ill Will, stay scomit
Why's drama when other artists pay homage
You hatin any rapper I do a song with
"What's wrong with Nas helpin' crews get stronger"
You selfish, wantin' me to yourself
But prophets need help too, y'all see Nas get insulted
I ride for the real shit, High as the Lock's get melted
Twelve Years, givin' you nuttin' but big moments
How can Murda Inc not wanna fuck wit
The top hustler - R.O.C. crusha
Nas a legend 'fore BIG & Pac left us
Bubbled wit Dr. Drizze, you heard it on Makaveli
Sayin': "Nas is ring leader, brings Ether, brings heater"
Your dream teamer scream, "He's the Supreme Teacher"
Similar to anybody you know
Oh, I created, cremated, bodied that flow
Anyone you think is fuckin' wit me
Better be vets, better be Ra, better be Kool G, or KRS
Better be LL, or Slick or them
Neva put me in the Top Ten, bitch!
It's disrespect to the life that burnt the verses
Or nigga writes who comes first
It's the Ice Cube, MC Shan, them type dudes
So BET's list was wrong, don't get me wrong
I did chill in the throne alone so long
This is my My Will
[Outro]
Yeah, Escobaro Cigars, that's how we doin' it
Ayyo Quan, welcome to the game!
Shot-out to Ill Will (This is my my will)
Bravehearts stand up! Whuttup Scarface?
Whuttup Tre Williams?
 (This is my will)
Ill Will '05, what y'all know 'bout that?
Queens, Queens I know you miss me
I gotchu, I gotchu Queens, New York stand up!
Aha, I gotchu baby, let's do it again!

[Intro: Nas]
Yea, uh, uh, real niggas dawg, ya heard
Yea, journey to the life, just journey
[Verse One: Nas]
I'm the nigga that ain't loud
Throw C-low
, never ace out
Only move out wit a particular crew, I hate crowds
The observer, money and murder the hood praise it
I was raised in it, early age
Was presented with the ultimatum
Be a boss with a army, drop the Atari games
Hard cocaine that had my neighborhood strung out
Brains numb out, guns out
I was smart high hopes in my heart
But dope cartels would emerge
Bloody shirts on niggas while they hollerin'
'Til their lungs don't work
Figures I end up with a scarred memory of my youth
With dudes in the drug loot, feelin' henny "SHOOT"
My nigga Will still here, man I wish it was truth
Buried in his favorite shit, FILA sneakers and FILA suit
My eyes are the window of my soul
My niggas let the Indo roll
Thinkin' time flies we gettin' old
That's the words of my right hand man, my main dawg
We been rollin since day one, he down for the cause
All he talk is extortion, kidnap shit, big gat shit
I'm like - "yo think positive", but he act sick
He only think about lettin' his Mac spit
He like fuck who he hit
Me it bothers, cause he know I'm rent 'em it regardless
If he keep wildin' out he's makin' both of us targets
So I pull him, tell him on some deep shit, try to school 'em
We already lost niggas by how we was movin'
We still livin', but our lives need much improvin'
I think I'm gonna lose 'em
[Hook: Nas]
I was blind in this world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack and run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
Like all this time, it's just a fragment of my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me
[Verse Two: Nas]
Feelin' like I got the dons clout
Trigger pawn cocked Glocks spray up your moms spot
I ain't playin' wit you, war, fuck pistols
Bring machines, icy bell buckles, ten guns, M-1'S with ice muzzles
Life's a struggle, get your wifey touch too, everybody involved
Homicide, doctors patchin' up your war scars
Task Force chargin' at us, news flash, thug crews blast at officers
Coroners pick you up from the grass
Livin' fast 'til somebody tries meltin' my chest
I'm high loosin' it, could of hit my own self with the tec
Refuse to quit, but I tried tellin' me to relax
It's like I can't hear my words 'til I'm trapped to the max
Even then I blame everybody else except me, pops left me
I was just three, I cried for help, moms was busy
That don't mean nigga's stupid
But I got a habit wit - makin' up excuses
Was born ruthless, hated school, they ain't teach me I'm a bad seed
Planted in this ghetto, where my niggas can't read
Multiply, subtract; only knowin' how to count cracks and count stacks
Now what y'all know about that
One side of me wanted out of this life
Glue traps on the floor for the mice
'Til the nigga saw the light
I wanted money when I got it, I would 
spend it
I wanted jewels, but when 
I heard it, yo I wouldn't listen
All of the drama in my life I got my self into
All the toxins my body took in, faded my mental
I let these niggas words get to me
But 
I'm tired of my ice, tired of Bentley
It's the end of the century
I recognized the world is a beautiful place
Niggas opinions ruinin' my musical taste
Cause everytime I caught a case, could of got me in jail
If you wasn't scared of jail, you more likely to fail
I thought the whole world was cursed, from the hand I was dealt
And +My Worst Enemy+ was my self
Word to my self...word to my self...word to my self...
[Hook: Nas]
I was blind to the world
All I thought about was diamonds and pearls
I had beef wit a nigga, then I'm clappin' his girl
Nappin' his kids, ransack, run through his rib
Blow up his mom's crib, there's no way he could live
It's gettin' clearer, starin' at the man in the mirror
Cause all this time, it was a fragment in my mind
Come to find out, shit wasn't what is made to be
In reality +My Worst Enemy+ was me

Word word word word
[Nas]
I come through in a new double R listening to smiling faces
Check out my jewelry pound in your faces
Italian air forces leather laces with the basket weave
Iron in your face so fast from the draft so sneeze
It's the nastiest, flashiest, turn girls to Massicast
Cause I be giving them pain, it's a cold world
Bernie Mac will be snappin' on you
But I ain't a joke; you think I'm here to entertain you
Fallen angel after them halos
Nobody moves until I say so, take the money out the safe slow
Escape route and I'm out, I cake out like intimates
Like the brightest, the flyest
[Hook]
You got to be the flyest
I know your ass is mean, like you be strappin them
Jeans, but you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just take my pumps while standing in your pumps
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You just breathe and stare while I'm pulling your hair
Cause you can work it like that
You got to be the flyest
You can be Nas's angel, let the largest train you but
You work it like that
[Nas]
Uh, Philly rap a hydro, puffing on a line slow
Your CD needs me, keep it kickin' like Del Greco
Pull up at the Delano South Beach I know
For King Solomon jury security in the Tahoe
Spandex for money, I stay on the tight
G-packs and weed stacks stay on the flight
Elbow out the left window, okays on the right
Canary out our ears, you know she playing them right
Hilton style, billionaire boys club
Braveheart, ya'll don't want no war with us
Dump a semi-auto made by, I made girls bust
When I hit them full thrust, full throttle
[Hook]
[Nas]
Big living, what it tastes like, tapes right, used to hate life
To move an eight, every night was my passion
Pipe bombs safe from stashes, Aston's, Rolls Royces
Cold oysters and many sorts of women shake like horses
I got them peeling out their clothes, really about this dough
Problem, hear me out just scone from my pistol poppin'
It's at my mind, just a mystery school
Brainwash them, then fix them with my tools
Mami hit me with some moves
I'm addicted to spinning, dipping these women in different waters
Watching for dudes with tape recorders on them cause they informants
I been okay with these warmers
Girls harass me and gas me and say that I'm enormous
[Hook]
Move your waist girl.. Yeah yeah (x2)
You got to be Nas's Angel
You can be Charlie's Angel
You can be Nas's Angel

Just like niggas can't do what you do
[Nas] Right, right
[Dre] You know, can't nobody fuck with this

Niggas need to kill that shit
And make some money, y'know
[Nas] Word
[Dre] Fuck it
[Nas] What is it, what is it God
[Dre] Let's get together, make some fuckin' music
[Nas] Right, that's what I'm sayin', that's what I'm sayin'
[Dre] and get paid, and just, let that be it
All these niggas talkin all this bullshit
Better sit back, and watch what happens
[Verse 1]
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holding out
Let the streets be the court and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable 86 shit
Foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Soliciting ill editions of that Murder I Wrote
A provocative plan can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment,
 
like Farrakhan
 
said we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes chrome kitted up
Calicones lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts
I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutching gats quick to bust
But knowing how these niggas tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you
[Hook]
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nas is coming
Nasty Nas is coming
Nas is comin
[Verse 2]
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol,
 
tied his hands to make examples
Substantial amounts you owe to the firm
Crew, Firm affliation,
 
paper chasing
Chips glossy, rich
 
Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado,
 
blazing hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle,
 
nacho cheese, I'm Castro
Compared to these niggas who swear to be real
But impostors to Hoffa
Nas plague kills
Counting bills to send to all my jail niggas who fell
From New York to LA, QB to CPT
 
for GP
A hundred G cars
Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout,
 
murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's something venereal
But back in stereo
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
From childbirth to hearses,
 
flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic,
 
get bent stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way the
 
Bridge
 
say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Crist' push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens,
 
pull up beside, have a listen y'all Nas y'all
Fly gangsta wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump
 
in the courtroom drunk,
 
links truck
Rocky bracelet
 
cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero black DeNiro
Federal Bureau tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro
 
diamond roll, hustling low
Pro-file white gold style, raking bloody dough by the pile
Shot down still alive he struggling for the phone
Fo-fo blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung
[Hook]
[Outro: Dr. Dre]
Check this out, it's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
East meets West
That's how we making it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Aiyyo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherfucking clowns out here
Riffing and beefing about this bullshit
Yo while they doing all that
We just gon' kick back with these honeys
This Cristal and party to the year 2G
[Hook]

[Produced by DJ Premier]
[Verse 1]
Freedom or jail, clip's inserted, a baby's being born
Same time a man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends,
 
carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustling for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs living large, taking in light
Pushing big toys,
 
getting nice,
 
enjoying your life
Is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around their neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell,
 
rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N-A-S are the letters that spell
NAS, NAS
[Scratched Hook]
"Nas is like life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half man half amazing.."
"No doubt.."
[Verse 2]
"Nas is like.." Earth, Wind & Fire,
 
rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line 'em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
"Nas is like.." Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left,
 
let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blasting, tecs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, owning acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, giving fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it with you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave,
 
I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Making choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is
[Scratched Hook]
[Verse 3]
"Nas is like.." Sex to a nympho, but nothing sweet
I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper,
 
green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learning somethin deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always
 got you, 
I’m like Pac dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies,
 
I'm like all races
Combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feeling of a millionaire spending a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream,
 
a thug poet
Live it and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night
Now

[Verse: 1]
Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
Cuz I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse
While you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street till I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playin' for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearin a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah
[Hook x2]
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastrodamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar
Now he is Nastrodamus
[Verse: 2]
I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
Let Nastradamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggas in jail
Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave the streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar on sunset, then the sex is so high-tech
Uh
[Hook]
[Verse: 3]
Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
And we gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you CEO from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Two G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, Piaget watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless
Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eye can understand that I'm...

[Intro]
(Y'all ready for Nas?
Queensbridge
 y'all ready to see Nasty Nas?
Uh huh, they ready)
Yeah, word
Got some 
Remy Martin
 
and some good-ass cigars,
 check it out
[Verse 1]
Ayo, late night, candlelight,
 
fiend with diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal
I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of scotch,
 
smoke pot and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it’s a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I’m under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter, it's love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck,
 
panties start drippin’
The ways of Carlito,
 
blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop Rolls, hoes drop clothes
Louis the XIII,
 
freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain’t my fault, semiautomatic weapons I brought
The world crazy,
 
I’m rich and I’m girl-crazy
Dick ‘em, convince ‘em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose ‘em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since the Tunnel and Skate Key,
 
my jewelry in HD
[Verse 2]
Silent rage,
 
pristine in my vintage shades
I’m not in the winters of my life or the beginning stage, I am the dragon
Maserati,
 
pumpin’ Biggie, the great legend
Blastin’,
 
I’m after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I’m so high, I never land like Mike Jackson’s crib
Vest on, .45 still crack ya rib sacrilege
Talk trash about the nasty kid
Past nasty now, I’m gross and repulsive,
 
talk money
Is you jokin’, cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceilings, the safe, bitch, I got it, you envy but don’t offend me
I’m skinny, but still I’m too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent me
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the ’90s
Drug dealer car,
 
rush to the bar
Move, niggas, we don’t give a fuck who you are
Black card
 
heavy like a magnet,
 
in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them saggin’,
 
bet a hundred stacks
Niggas’ll run it back just havin’ fun
I ain’t even begun to black,
 
light another blunt in fact
[Interlude]
(Nasty) Yeah, nasty kid
[Verse 3]
For the hustlers,
 
thick as yellow bitches
 
for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin’
Saying it was Nas I used to hustle with
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashish,
 
guns on my waist
, past this
Since I’m cakin’ up,
 
put funds in my safe,
 
laughin’
And joining the blunt passin’ you niggas was straight assin’
Excuse the vulgarity, I’m still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin’ me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin’ they drivin’
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin’
Fake it ’til you make it,
 
I’ve driven those toys
Been in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin’ in doors
For my deen niggas, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I’m no fake rap CD listener
Sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my Gs, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga

[Verse 1]
It ain't hard to tell, I excel and prevail
The mic comes in contact with the third rail
My raps react, they attack the whack just like a maniac
With this, see I'm a brainiac
I call you tattoo, you never come off
I flip the script with a sawed-off, boss
A modern Shakespeare - reincarnated
Brains are elevated
, 
I'm bein' R rated
This style is terror, drastic
Meltin the plastic, and I eat mics just like acid
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
Cause I be packin like a Rasta in a weed spot
Hittin your heart with a hollow-tip verbally illin
Minds minipulated, my raps are nickel-plated
I execute raps like I'm swingin an axe around
This is a mic shut down
Notify the President - that I'm bombin your residence
And I'm leavin no evidence
Voice box yells, lyrics will excel
Rappers gettin smoked, you can smell the hot shells
Your style is fake snake, well dramatized
You might as well be a singer but ain't harmin' Nas
Here's the break, I can translate lyrics so well
I excel, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook]
It ain't hard to tell
[Verse 2]
I got a case of vocal fever, I'm here to make you a believer
Nas wrecks the tweeters and receivers
Lyrics will explode, my brain overloads
Gimme a Grammy competition is dead just like Sammy
I leave minds magnetized like slaves
Your style is old fashion like waves
Holdin a pistol at a pastor
, pullin the trigger faster
Tell 'em I was sent by his Master
But that topic's too deep for your ear
Here's the science you can comprehend clear
Advanced intellectual, a time bomb speeder
I'll know your whole card - just like a palm reader
Non-stop, 
I'm bustin heads like the FEDS baby pops
This is not the Kindergarten Cop
Put on your blindfold, I'mma release and stand tall
I detonate bombs at the policeman's ball
This is art from the heart, I leave 'em marked for death
In each breath in this game I'm the ref
Already I'm ill but I can only get better
With lyrics as pretty as a nickel-plated Beretta
I master dialects, of uncommon languages
A black man caught by the Klan couldn't hang with this
These are proverbs, copy cat attackers
I'm wanted dead cause I'mma genocide to rappers
Battlin Nas is dead when my brain reacts
You might as well have fell asleep on a train track
This ain't the same track that you're used to
This is rhyth-i-matic automatic, try it you oughta have it
Slaughter your tape recorder; givin thanks to my supporters
And keep flowin like water
No matter the obstacle, Nasty Nas will prevail
Aiyyo, it ain't hard to tell
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Check it
I catch wreck with my intellect
, 
suckers are incorrect
I'm gonna win cause you slept
On Nas, word is bond, I leave the microphone torn
False rappers, you need to write your own song
Metaphors of murder man, hittin' like 
Roberto Duran
Hold the mic in my hand, my life span
Imitators will sweat me like gym class
Your raps are fat shit, then I'll be Slim Fast
New rap recruits I salute then delete 'em
Verbally eat 'em, because my ears don't need 'em
Nas is a terrorist
, analyst
Swingin my fists like a nigga breakin, 
posessed by Satan
You couldn't compete with a beat that was fast or slow
Brothers is gettin shipped out like I was Castro
I can eat your flavor but I'm not a candy lover
I use a Lethal Weapon, just like Danny Glover
Execute monologues, sabotage entourage
Mutilate mics like a maniac at large
I talk with slang, and use my brain
Generate pain, penetrate your vein
Move like a maniac, Nas is nice son
Talk to your conscience and 
hit like Tyson
No competition, cause I cause wonders
Nas will battle rappers by the football numbers
A motor mouth killer, rhyme writin thriller
Hold a mac-11, and attack a reverend
Don't sleep cause you might not wake
I speak deep, dialects I translate
Queens Prince
, commit sins on the regular
Murder my competitors, and et cetera
Nas is a gypsy Egyptian
Flippin' the script'n microphone manufacturers are victims
My voice makes your ear drums swell
[Hook]

Queensbridge, 41st side
Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin 1010 WINS AM
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin "Dunn" but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the Glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell
[Hook]
Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)
We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong)
We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)
Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, english, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for 
 fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and 
Chorus
Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I 
 like it's Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The 
 be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse
Chorus 2x

*Man laughing*
[Verse 1: Nas]
I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick,
 
summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys,
 
pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggas, bird niggas speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple shells at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'mma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused
Cause none of y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage
[Verse 2: Nas]
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, 
swallow forty cal. bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila
, 
pocket full of scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Coppola, Samson
 -- 
no Delilah
You're pint-sized, 
I'm Mike's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at
, 
sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like Lawry's
Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys,
 you hire 
Magnum PI
's 
to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise
, 
try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage
[Verse 3: Nas]
Son's back with flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them guns come out
My cavalry woulda been through ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be,
 
don't want it with me
Straight savage

[Nas talking]
Man, we love you man, you hear me?
This is coming from the General man, Nas man
Bravehearts love you man, this is to all of ya niggas
Who been using my name from day one to make yourselves famous
Whether you shouting me out on your records
Whether you try to come at me on your records, or whether you just you know...?
You know... you know how you dick riding man? This goes out to ya
Cause we love you man, I've done made a lot of niggas famous man
But I'm gon' make you...I make you make the papers, this one's for you
Hey yo, word up
It been a lot of times when a nigga ain't wanna fuck with this rap shit no more
Fuck this shit, but you know...? Through the year I started to see shit, you knowamsayin?
Nigga see niggas driving around with fancy cars, diamonds all that shit
Niggas thinking nigga chilling
Got to go through a whole bunch of big shit, all that bullshit
But you know what? Fuck that shit, you know how I feel? Yo
[Nas with Hook]
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you got to understand its life baby
I'm never gonna give it up, fuck that
I made a mil', but that ain't good enough
Ocean and a beach so I can really live it up
See, that's the life baby, you got to understand its life baby
[Verse 1]
Uhh... I got the mansion and the nice ride
Platinum chain, and an ice watch
All this fame in my life's hard
I entertain, been so many places, see so many different faces
They look the same from the stages
After the concert, hours of long work
Home sick form the role
, smoking my lungs hurt
Even thought now I'm recording songs
It's better than, when I was pedaling doing wrong
I brought the crew along, we thuggin
Fucking married bitches; they go to their husbands
Bitches ain't shit, we laughing with them
Can't even role the streets now, without the heat
I bust the nigga off impost, that shit is weak
On trial, what I'mma tell the judge
He don't give me no smile, he don't give me no love, nor the jury
That's when I need celeb status and the blackness
This motherfucker's hate rappers, what a life
[Hook: with changes]
[Verse 2]
My girl hate when I'm with my boys, think I'm cheating
Every morning knocking at my door state policeman
Give him a reason, but I don't give it to him
They said they heard a disturbance, and I just listen to him
See, I cooperate until they push me
Cops hate when you know the law, you ain't pussy - you not fake
Can't explain how much I miss the block
When we was slinging with my niggas, screaming "Fuck the cops!"
Now when I'm dreaming I can see my dead friends smile
Wake up, I get some air, hit the mall for a while - pick up some gear
I'm going to the studio; my engineer put the track up from "out west"
And he told me spit it clear...Uhh
Another hit is just made, another album
So ones again we getting paid, and now we wilding
Get hype to shoot the video, all in the city yo
I'm hoping that a nigga blow, but ya don't hear me thought
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Uhh...the haters say I ain't shit
Hope I fall, but I can't slip
Got to ball, got to bank chips
Old ladies hate my moms cause their kids ate them out to nothing
Catch my moms on the bench fronting
I got to stay awake, got to pray today
Glad I'm still alive, fuck what them haters say
So many times I ain't wanna rhyme
Wanted a normal life, when I ain't Nas all the time
Uhh...so many problems too, do what I got to do
As long as my moms say, "Boy, I'm proud of you!"
I keep laying hits, one is never quits
Plus if I stop, how will I stay legit?
[Hook]

This episode of OTL is a special one. We got the incredible opportunity to sit down with the Don, Nas, to engage him in a back and forth about his iconic album, 
. The debut album of Nas and a landmark album in both its regional scene and in the overarching hip hop landscape,

Open up your facial like your boy Roy

[Verse 5: Nas]
It's genocide, it's a Genocide
It's a genocide, it's a genocide
Fifth floor cooking raw had my own supply
Cause of capitalist ways
, 
that was back in the days
So now I do rap and it pays

[Hook]
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, still we choose to ignore
The obvious, man this history don't acknowledge us
We were scholars long before colleges
They say we N-I double G-E-R, we are
Much more, but still we choose to ignore
The obvious,
 
we are the slave and the master
What you lookin for? You the question and the answer
[Verse 1]
We trust no black leaders, use the stove to heat us
Powdered eggs and government cheeses
The calendars with Martin, JFK and Jesus
Gotta be fresh to go to school with fly sneakers
Schools with outdated books, we are the forgotten
Summers, coolin off by the fire hydrant
Yeah I'm from the ghetto
Where old black women talk about their sugar level - 
it's not unusual
To see photos of dead homie's funerals
Aluminium foil on TV antennas
Little TV sit on top the big TV, eating TV dinners
Girls dye their hair with Kool-Aid
They gave us lemons, we made lemonade
But this nigger's paid, ancestral slaves
Descendant of kings, it's necessary I - bling
Put rims on everything, wear Timbs on every scene
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Do I mean it like a slave master, nigger?
No I'm gangsta, gotta eat rappers
My abbreviation was young when I caught the cases
That should mean the court could see my changes, take off the bracelets
Savage when broke, Smoke sour diesel,
 
need no Bowflex
My chest still cut up like a bag of dope
Thought patterns consist of boss matters
Spit Moses' lost commandments like a gross sandwich out my mouth
Toast to government cameras peepin us, every week I must
Have my cars, homes and phones squeaked for bugs
But this is what I was dreamin of
Between cuttin hard coke with new razors slicin my fingers up
They used to string us up, we wanted everything
But the one bringin us cake be the snakes like the
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes,
 
tryin to get it like Medellin
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position
They been know I ain't just rappin for fame
I got my old homie's half-sister's father askin' for chains
Yep, I give the cash up, this paper don't matter
They see me from skinny to fatter, when I rap about war
They got a tendency to scatter, they ain't my backup no more
So now my enemies are at my front door
Cause anytime we mention our condition, our history or existence
They callin it reverse racism
Still to this day the streets torn - my brother Jung'
I'll always have a seat for him - not behind me, beside me
You'll always know where to find me
They say the close ones will hurt you
So let's keep a small circle
On the road to riches and diamond rings
In the land of the blind, the man with one eye is the king
[Hook]

[Hook]
No idea's original,
 
there's nothing new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major
[Verse 1: Nas]
If niggas could look inside my mind, you'll find
Where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the brain cell graveyard
Where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin' spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin' I'm still winnin', I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers,
 
'caine/Kane
"No Half Steppin'" with flat tops when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, 
Benetton
, 
the Gods buildin'
Ask for 
today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin' on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, 
Five Percenters
 said it's 
pork in Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
On a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
You're part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, 
brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling
, 
stripped for your chain,
 the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them treacherous rastas in the Mexican mafias
Be scrapping with tats on they back
, violent wars
Nothing less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watching for paint chips, don't want no lead in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child
, the 
bezzy
 be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shining since 
Roxanne Shante' made "Runaway"
; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep
, 
my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My 
Exodus
 
doesn't exist, I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens
, 
wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things
Like, somebody's always watching
My life before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection? Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled
Headline reading "Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin'"
[Hook: repeat 2X]

[Produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League]
[Verse 1]
PS 111 had free lunch
Embarrassed but managed to get a plate
We was kids hungry
Mom's working, I was famished
She getting home late
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full or starve
Corner store like Mr. Spare-a-Quarter
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb
How could I not partake
Fifteen I got a gun
Sixteen I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun
What's got inside my brain
A hustler's job ain't done, til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of
Dudes who switch up and change
They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them know
I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow
[Verse 2]
I remember early mornings
Syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells
Elevators was out of order yeah
Worth two hundred million now
Bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing forty, she only twenty-one
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion Black motherfuckers
To take over JP and Morgan, Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back
[Verse 3]
1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years
The whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him
I spread em, hit them and dead them
She says, third leg from a legend is sheer heaven
She says, it is the greatest loving
The tales you hear is the truth on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets
I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis
This goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha

[Nas]
Everyday she walk by
See me on the same block
Same crew, like she never seen rocks
Chain watch, rims blue
Different color boots on, park Yukon
You predicates ex-cons, rip arms, bettin' chips
Puff medicine play my gangsta beats
Tunnel bangers, Flex, Clue tapes bang in the streets
I'm just a fly, thuggish baller shorty anxious to meet
Till I die keep wanting to head mink to the feet
But shorty jail bait, might get me five to life
Maybe in time you can be Nas's wife
Place school, study law
I'mma pay your tuition
Come on campus, buy you books
Do your babysitting
My unusual style make your future unwild
When you get older I'mma bless you with a child
See now you was unaware that this thug had affection
Let me be your angel and I'll be your protection
1 - [3LW]
It's either you will
Either you won't
Sometimes you do
Sometimes you don't
Sometimes it's yes
Other times it's no
But I can't take it no more
Take your wrong and make it right
Just say you can make up your mind
Is it serious or isn't it?
Cause I can't take it no more
Make 'em clap to this...
Baby, baby you keep
Putting things before me
But I was there for you when you had nothing
So baby, baby
Basically it's them or me
Now or never
Give me all or nothing
Repeat 1
Make 'em clap to this...
Baby, baby
You keep telling me you're changing
You promise you will be a better man
But no soon as you see your peeps
There you go switching out on me
And we're back at square one again
[Nas]
Don 3, can't get with me
Y'all just a child-child
Maybe I can get you with little Sammie and Bow Wow
Please girls try to understand me now-now
Like my little sisters I'mma hold you down-down
Got the whole world in your hands
Three little woman
 got these young boys tryna be their man
Do your thing shorty but if they get disrespectful
Get on your cell phone call big brother Esco
Now let's go
[3LW]
Cause all this back and forth
In and out, ups and downs
Is beginning to wear me out
See you gotta tell me now
Tell me now
Don't wait till the end
It's either me or your friends
Yeah, yeah, yeah
[Trackmasters]
Remix, Trackmasters, Remix
Remix, Precision, Remix
We about to make ya clap to this
Remix, uh
Repeat 1 till end

[Maxwell]
Oooooooooooh!
[Nas]
Maxwell go and sing
[Maxwell]
Ooohh, this for the ladies
[Nas]
M-A-X
[Maxwell]
Doin' it
[Nas]
N-A-S
[Maxwell]
I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again (who's back)
Ooh, tell me (who's back)
I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again
[Nas]
Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she would decide on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day a March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was the wine though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't stop
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some top
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we sashayed across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us two
[Maxwell]
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl lookin' as good as you)
There's nobody but you
(They can try, they can try)
No other girl in the room
(But you know, you know, you know)
No other girl in the room
(Oh, oh, ooo ooo)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl, no)
There's nobody but you
(They try)
No other girl in the room
(There's nobody to,)
[Nas]
In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, 
sip Jose
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us
All I could hear was the sound of (her)
Twirlin' her around just (her)
See nobody in the crowd just (her)
[Maxwell]
(No other)
No other girl in the room
(No one)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl)
There's nobody but you
(Thinkin' about you baby, baby)
No other girl in the room
(Never ever, ever, ever, see you)
No other girl in the room
(Oh)
No other girl in the room but you
(No other girl has, they're not you)
There's nobody but you
(Oooh baby yeah)
No other girl in the room
[Nas]
Uh, horns!
Clap
Everybody clap
C'mon, clap
Max mellow 'em out
[Maxwell]
Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl
Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you
Just you, just me, no one else but you
No one, no one, just me and you, oh babe
[Nas]
Clap! Break it down
[Olu Dara]
You know it all comes from Africa
But my version is the blues

[Nas]
What nigga! What bitch-ass niggas! What! Babe, babe, start the car!
[Kelis]
Nasir, come on let's go! Get in the car now, let's go! Throw it out, let's go!
[Nas]
Aight, aight, aight, yeah. But I got 'em. But I got 'em, though
[Kelis]
This is crazy, why didn't you just throw it out of the car?
This is so stupid, what are you doing? Why are we even out here?
Why are we out here? What's going on? This is retarded, yo we gotta..
This is crazy. Never again. You'd throw everything away, for what?
[
Nas
: laughs]
Yeah, my man Kool G Rap told me son do not look back
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax
When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin'
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies
And twist, 
homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride
That's what I got the public thinkin' my nigga
Just cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga
I know who died before the body dropped
I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got
Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all
The top ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time
Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all
Who to call and who to stay away from
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up
What cars and what trucks they drive in what towns
They spend the most time in when they grindin'
I found out most of them are cowards they hidin'
Behind reputations that's sour
Not going back
[Kelis]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
[Nas] I'm not goin' back
[Kelis]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
[Nas] I'm not goin' back
[Nas]
First thing that happen when you make a little paper
You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper
Till you come across some ever more flyer paper
Realize that five-star 'tellies are even greater
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes
All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid
Cause in reality I'll earn my salary
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me
It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing
How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact
Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings
Whores charge niggas with raping
Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars
Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars
So they counter the laws to take what's ours
Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge
So you can't stop us from making a billion dollars
Instead of goin' back I'm buying the projects
But I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all
But I'm not going back
[Kelis]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
[Nas] I'm not goin' back
[Kelis]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
[Nas]
And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to
Those no friends of mine..
(And I'm not going back to)
Ten carat gold it shine..
(And I'm never going back to)
Sony if they don't have dough to sign..
(Not going back to)
Y'all know that I'm not going back to
Those liars who would..
(Not going back to)
Not help you if they could..
(Not going back to)
Coke on the stove in the hood..
Y'all should know that I'm not going back
The hood's in me forever y'all
But I'm not going back
[Kelis]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
[Nas] I'm not goin' back
[Kelis]
The streets keep tryin' to say
Come back around this way
I've already gone that way
I won't go back today
[Nas] I'm not goin' back

[Intro]
A lot of times it seems like, you ain't gon' make it where you wanna be in life
But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby
That's my word
[Verse 1]
Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in
Major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
Guide us through your hood and any locality
, 
head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood mb cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think
 of Old Easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' fucked up
From Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot
 willin'
Look at the chain I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
For steppin' on the next man's nikes
 
my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
Be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever
[Hook x2]
Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, cause time flies, don't it?
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
Cuz nothin' lasts forever
[Verse 2]
Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
Gucci iceberg, 
coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak 
silver spurs
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin', "Damn, wish my niggas could afford this"
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried with your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the fuck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you
The shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turned 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real
Everything must eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
Cuz nothin' lasts forever, ya know
[Hook x2]
Ya now, nothin' lasts forever ya know
Let it go, let it go

[Verse 1: K’naan]
Uh, someone called the cops on him
Someone told his pops on him
He was talking crooked and he had some rocks on him
Tucked, tucked in his socks’ corner
Chucks, chucks and the Charlotte Hornet
Cap, 
when he flowed then they all surprised on him
Yes, he's a Fugee but he go all Nas on ‘em
Well, can’t go Pras on ‘em
And he got that 
crossover
But he from the streets you don’t cross over
Hut, hut to the block soldiers
Buck, buck to the cop vultures
Nope, no I don’t know pilots
Nigga I know pirates
Violence the islands
Shout out to my idrens
Put your hands up like it’s a mother fuckin’ siren
[Hook: K’naan]
Well, I paid all my dues
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Shone a million shoes
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
‘Cause when you got nothing left
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
You got nothing to lose
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
[Verse 2: Nas]
I used to stand on Vernon and 10
Burnin’ a spliff burner on hip
Wishing to flip a bird, yac burning my chest
Black certainly I’m dressed
Strictly that army shit
Finish my shift
Pack gone before the dawn hit
Anything I could earn on the strip
Turn it and flip
Watching my back
Cooking the pot
Making it stretch
Discussing with’ my clique
Should we duct tape the connect
It’s rough and K’naan knows
He had the same woes
I’m voicing my opinions
I forgot y’all was there
I ain’t know y’all was still listenin’
Be honest I ain’t care
Y’all don’t get my innuendos my interests
Y’all on some simple shit
Thinking I’m preachy
Yeah my church is the world
Christians sip a cup of this holy water
Stuck at this phony border
It’s custom to enter the main stream
You must front and record
A poorer oratory
Your life story corny
Yo, my Somali niggas know what war be
We fam'
[Hook]
[Verse 3: K’naan]
Remember when niggas said Nas was Somalian
Baseball caps had the tags, like a yardie and
It was written just came out, I was gnarly then
Niggas dreaded seein’ me like a Rastafarian
We didn’t know the dress code though we was bargainers
The knock off Filas, with the pumps and cheap cardigans
Niggas looked corny I admit, we was foreigners
But this corny kid, quick to send you to the coroners
Y’all know my war story, I won’t repeat it
It’s just injury, my victory’s undefeated
Thought you knew me well, go back and delete it
I’m in every joint this year, Orthopedic
And yes the AK’s are instruments we do drum ‘em
I’m somewhere between killa and king Solomon
And the shades take half the face we over stun ‘em
And treat obstacles like ass we overcome ‘em
Man, they really made me do this
I was peaceful like a Buddhist
But then niggas came and screwed it up like Judas
Now I’m suited up with Lugers
Rugers suddenly intruders
Turn around like hoola hoopers
Fucking losers
[Hook]
[Outro: K’naan]
This one’s for the world
This one’s for your girl
This one’s for your mama
This one’s for your nana

[Hook 1: Kevin Rudolf]
In the city of dreams, you get caught up in the schemes
And fall apart in the seam tonight
That boy he used to bomb fromm B.K. to the Bronx
And it's the fortunate one, who dies
[Nas]
New York, we ready
[Verse 1: Kevin Rudolf]
He moved from LAS to SoHo
A few blocks for those who don't know
Down the hall punched a hole in the wall
Bounced out, all are in control
Certified son of a gun
Learns life lesson 101
Don't fly too high on your own supply
Get burnt by the sun
[Hook 1]
[Verse 2: Kevin Rudolf]
He was NY's talk of the town
Heard out to the LI sound
He started dating models and he figured it out
He used to be a nice guy, then he cut that shit out
Qualified sex machine
No better than a vowy fiend
She wanted a ride to the upper East side
But he dropped her ass off in queens
[Hook 2: Kevin Rudolf]
Cause in the city of dreams, you get caught up in the schemes
And fall apart in the seam tonight
That boy would play his guitar like he was ready for war
And then he'd lift up his voice to the sky
[Verse 3: Nas]
Yo, ok, my city, my town, my crown
Michael Bloomberg, forget what you heard
I'm thought of highly, shopping Louie, Gianni
Christian Lacroix shades, what can a boss say?
City, bus, the subway, cab, the runway
Ski masks and gunplay: my past at a young age
The illest city on the planet
Towers came down, Wall Street barely standing
We Crook Brothers, opposite of Brook Brothers
My footsteps of Scatman Crothers
It's just generations of style to get five luminous minutes with me
Interviews on how I flip sixty-twos
This isn't my style, I spit what I'm living right now
I'm out on the town, gold bars shutting it down
Bottles stacked from the floor to the ceiling
Then it's a loud fool, fifty-third street, right near the Hilton
I'm fighting the feeling I had when I was lighting up buildings
Now I'm writing for millions of listeners
Critics who just don't get it, they try dissing us
New York full of kings and queens, all the rest just mimic us
[Hook 2]

[Intro]
Ayo, black, it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Straight out the fucking dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo
[Verse 1]
Rappers, I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holding an M16, see with the pen I'm extreme,
 
now
Bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes,
 
hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sitting bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner betting Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughing at baseheads tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick,
 
forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggas be running through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, "Back up," the Mac spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran – I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, "Yo, my shit is stuck"
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jetting to the building lobby
And it was full of children probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So what you sayin'?)
 
It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pulling the triggers bringing fame to their name
And claim some corners,
 
crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids – they run up on us
45's and gauges, Macs, in fact
Same niggas will catch a back-to-back, snatching your cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block getting niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she's got to smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers in measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation, inside information
Keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind
[Hook]
New York state of mind
[Verse 2]
Be having dreams that I'm a gangsta,
 
drinking Moets,
 
holding Tecs
Making sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks,
 
sewing up the blocks to sell rocks
Winning gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walking with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I have niggas undressin'
Thinking of cash flow, buddah and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'm a hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays,
 
bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back,
 
black
I'm living where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack,
 
I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, holmes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blaming us, we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm taking rappers to a new plateau,
 
through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm an addict for sneakers, 20's of buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzle as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
[Hook]

[Produced by DJ Premier]
[Nas]
Uhh
Yo, yo-yo, y'all
Whattup? Whattup
It's time man (Word, it's time?)
Straight up, it's time man
Aight, set that shit off
(Set it off then nigga, set it off)
Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock
, 
momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
Why not?
 
It might've saved later from my block
N.Y. cops
, 
hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
Stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin
But who else, could it be
, 
shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve
; 
they bust a U-ey, I jog
To my building
 -- 
come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men
Niggas gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare
With dead eyes --
 
tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
Father's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin up
, 
eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggas, got two in heaven
Six of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick
The sixth one's parole flipped
; 
five niggas, went to four quick
When he went O.T.
, 
college life, converted into gangbangin
Four niggas still hangin, years passin and slang changin
Three of us now
, 
fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit
Fake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth
Could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin out, to the death for these ends,
 WHAT?
New York, New York (New York state of mind)
New York, New York (New York state of mind)
*repeat while Nas is talking*
You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news ("Get money!")
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase, youknowhatImean?
New York state of mind baby, check it out
[Nas]
I'm at the, gamblin spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggas sing along
All the cigarette smoke's cloggin my lungs,
 
hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggas both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggas got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in or leave
Cause I ain't playin, niggas'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggas'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggas, just New York niggas
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggas is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggas that be scared to do they bids
Fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggas, that relocated down South
Comin back to floss,
 
then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got
 
Crips and Bloods
, 
D.T.'s
Runnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score
But it's hard to get the shit off
Niggas fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggas, mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggas scheamin, some real, some niggas frontin
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin
New York, New York
New York, New York

[Intro]
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world
[Verse 1:]
Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some stopped wearin gold
Solar-energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve,
 
computers takin over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later
[Hook] 2x
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin
A new way to play, a new way a livin
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin
New life for man, children, and women
[Verse 2:]
Yo, 
the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK
, 
without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin pictures
New hustlas gettin new street figures
And US embassies overseas
Almost every foreign country's under seige
Covertly startin wars
, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage
[Hook]
[Verse 3:]
Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, somethin's out there watchin you and I
More enticin than 
Star Trek
, StarTec phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones
You got CD-Rom, everythang operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks
Y2K
's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin make me more happier than seein today
[Hook]

We sure to stay in touch and clean your mess up
And if you from the West Coast, my nigga, W-w-w-w-westside
[Nas]
Game got at me about the remix, it's an honor my nigga

The King's coming no, I'm not Jay-Z
Too many niggas hate me but they scared to face me
This ain't a movie dog,

I'm not an actor but I'll show your bitch big meat
She giving one blood, one love on dubs
A hundred forty thousand the first week
[Fat Joe]
All these niggas wanna front trill with them stiff faces
Till them niggas lying still up in stiff cases
Within styrofoam and embalming fluid
I been gone too long and I'm down to lose it
Somebody go and get this nigga a pine box
And I ain't just talking about a measly nine shots
Yeah I'm chopper-happy and my wrist loose
Call me Goldie I'll smack your bitch too
[Lil' Wayne]
504 gangsta New Orleans soldier
Banging underwater fuck around and soak you

That is where I sleep now give me my key
[N.O.R.E.]
New York get the blood money, dirty cash still sweet

Def Jam they gonna flop him and Reggaeton ain't hot in the building no more

And you ain't gotta go overseas to see Iraq shit
You can come to LeFrak Queens and get jacked quick
[Jadakiss and Styles P]
One Blood we used to the spilling
Came from the hood so we used to the killing
Used to the Black males making cracksales in the building
How else you get the Benz with the suede on the ceiling
Blood in, Blood out
Me and homie back to back
Both loaded working we about to pitch a shut out
I'm New York's king I'm New York's hardest nigga
Anything in between's a motherfucking target nigga

The hawk'll find a nice home right where your cheeks stay
We got a mean team hip-Hop dream team
Them boys is only in the projects on green screen

One dutch, one bud

Want a couple casualties, but we'll settle for just one blood
[Fabolous]
What it look like all I say at most
Shooters waiting on the word just say it Los
I let these niggas live yes I saw em pull the plug
Have them goons pulling gloves, leave the room full of slugs
Catch me trafficking on maroon colored dubs
Couple Africans with balloons full of drugs
If they like me tell em line up
While I sit behind team point em out like a line up
[Juelz Santana]
Mic check, one two, one two check
I'm strapped, you strapped let's play two-on-two

Mama told me not to play with fire but

West coast gang bang, riders erasing em
Got funny niggas raising up and riders replacing em, cuz
[Daz Dillinger]
Draped in blue, notorious gangsta crew
RIP for niggas who don't stay true
Deep down in the crevices see the jets veteran
Dwelling in the land of the gang bang profession
I'm legendary yes, yes a Westcoaster
Throwing up two C's
 
with two guns in my holster
I'm from Long Beach City a crip next to Compton
Down with my nigga Game if you niggas want problems
From the streets to the suites anywhere we can meet
Del Amo
 to Compton, Slauson Swap Meet
Worldwide get swept away by the tide
By Gs and BGs, OGs it's time to ride
[
WC
]
Who the rider, looter through the gutter man
Trued up in them Carolina blue Hurricanes
From the Westside striving to dead em
Where them killers throw that third letter up
Like Raymond Washington and Tookie Williams
Blue jeans, blue strings, blowing blueberry green
Cadillac on blue Ds and a blue tee
Money thick as blue cheese chunking up the dub
What the West be without Snoop and Dub C and one Blood
[E-40]
The Bay Area fuckers we pop em
Open you up if you got a problem
Up top born in Cali-forn-ia
Clean your clock open your can of tuna
Make a choice either it's hell or it's heaven
Get your chest layed out with the FM 57
This ain't nothing to do with nobody
But in the Yay there ain't nothing to do but catch bodies
[Bun B]
I'm coming straight outta PAT like Compton in all black
But when we say what it do they never say holla back
Bun B the OG like '95 Air Max
Neon green outta Flight Club offa Fairfax
Ask The Hundreds
, it's doable I done done it
At the summit of rap and I'm watching you haters plummet
Run to it or run from it to Bun it don't differ
Wipe the streets with you like you a swiffer as a gifter one blood
[Chamillionaire]
I'm the realest youngster thats breathing and I don't gotta give a reason
Chamillionaire a millionaire, y'all competing to be competing
My purpose is to get the cheese and as a purpose that should defeating
So shut your mouth, have a seat and be quiet till I finish eating
My label tells me I'm greedy, hogging all the room on your tv
Like Eric they think its Eazy
, but it isn't easy believe me
Need to make a room in B.E. television
 if you wanna be me
Game said he made room for Jeezy, I had to make room for me, G
[Slim Thug]
It's one Blood if you Blood or Cuz
From that number one Thug it's still one love
I rep my blue boy team but I do it for green
I do it for my folks Vice Lords and Kings
All the trappers future rappers standing out on the blocks
Tryna get up out the hood man and stack em a knot
Put your sets in the air scream fuck the cops
We gon rep for the hood man like it or not
[Young Dro]
My feed mashable, murders are catastrophical
Cars is improbable I'm overcoming obstacles
Trapping I made it logical my topic is impossible
I got a partner named Shoe Strang cause shorty real crossable
Shark meat to Pappadeaux,
 cars be tropical
All guns choppable all blocks are mobbable
I'm unstoppable my calico is toxable
Lyrically diabolical, cushion is not ???
[The Clipse]
Red rum, red rum such power in the tongue
Never in the wildest was he talking to them
Style on niggas but feel it to the numb
Japanese thread brought flavor to these bums
Consider me the savior, look what the Lord gave you
My celebrated presence like the return of Rayful
Frolic in the snow so playful
And reviving the track like we flowing through jumper cables
What duo you know get XXL kudos while copping off Coolio
Classic shit we mastered this left for dead, I'm back
I'm Lazarus
[Ja Rule]
Nigga, one Crip, one Blood
LA, New York
The Game, the Rule, one love guns up
Hands down, can't touch the flow is a bit much
The style wanna keep up
I'd advise you to speed up
With money moving like coke these days gotta re-up
G up, cop some heaters and dare a nigga to act up
You see us in dual seaters and throw it up
It's all hood niggas rep your sets if your Cuz or Blood
Niggas, we all bleed
These niggas can't breathe
Only because the guns are drawn and aimed to part
Niggas that got bullets with names on them
Want em, come get em niggas y'all know where to get at me
Look at me now pass me maybe you can be half me
You bastards, I'm laughing bullets sticking in family
Who sadly gets torn between one Crip and one Blood
Y'all niggas know me, yeah

[Produced by Q-Tip]
[Verse 1]
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should have slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged,
 
plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove,
 
one what? (One love)
[Hook: Q-Tip x4]
One love
One love
One love
One love
[Verse 2]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwilding in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home he'll play it low key
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies,
 
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs but one love
[Hook x4]
[Verse 3]
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects, I take my pen and pad
For the weekend hittin L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed something terrible
Fucking with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rolling two phillies together, in the Bridge we called 'em oo-wops
He said "Nas, niggas could be busting off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black trey-deuce"
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chilling on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
Cause when the pistol blows the one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'm ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love

[Verse 1]
What up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should have slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flipping, talking 'bout he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffing while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fucking with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged, plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hanging out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega, did you see him, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove, one what? (One love)
[Hook: Nas and Q-Tip] x5
One Love
[Verse 2]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crackheads stalking, loudmouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurting something, word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'mma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wilding on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal

For all the brothers in jail

One love means keepin' it real
One Love, One Love

[Verse 1]
All I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151
One sip'll make a nigga flip
Writing names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Acknowledge it,
 
leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up
The cop shot again
Bus stop glass bursts,
 
a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricocheting between the spots that I'm hiding in
Blacking out as I shoot back, fuck getting hit
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon
Sent from the star, sun, and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience
Leaving victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die, with nines out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga the time is now
[Hook]
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
All I need is one mic
[Verse 2]
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer – tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter of fact, maybe more than one
Look back, at all the hatred against me: fuck all of them
Jesus died at age 33, there's 33 shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's 32
Which means one of my guns was holding 17
27 hit your crew, 6 went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime
Hope your funeral
Never gets shot up
Bullets tear through the innocent
Nothing is fair
Niggas roll up, shooting from wheelchairs
My heart is racing, tasting revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of Macs, too many nines
If y'all niggas really with me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothing in our way
They bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flying, feel it
I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
Cause we stronger now my nigga, the time is now
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself
They don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talking all that slick shit
The same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is
Niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blasting, cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashing
War gets deep, some beef is everlasting
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifing each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed, body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwing dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Should've knew
 
she wasn't true
She came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blinding, I never make the same mistakes
Moving with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swelling my melon cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were telling police, how can a kingpin squeal
This is crazy, I'm on the right track
I'm finally found
You need some soul-searching
The time is now
[Hook]

[Verse 1: Nas]
If you knew my streets
You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who's snitchin', who told police
Who came home, who's still gone, who's restin' in peace
Now they're killing over music money not drugs
Rappers placed it cuz' thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip em with the funky rhythm I be kickin
Musician, inflictin composition of pain I'm like.. Saddam Hussein
Still alive, looking at his dead childrens birth remains
I birthed the game, learned you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft man y'all need some new weapons

[Intro: Nas & Brainpower]
Turn my headphones up
Nothin' gon' stop me now (uhu)
Nothin' baby
Nas, Brainpower…
I'm here now, (Nas
I'm here, it's your world…
It's yo world

Dit is voor al m'n peeps en fans en hers en ders
Die verder kijken dan de pers de kudde meningsvorming de herder dit vers
Ho heftiger de stress des te verder de levensles
Zich ontwikkelt des te verder 't besef
Wat moet je zonder liefde beginnen mis geliefden beminnend
In 't diepste van binnen met om in liefde voor zinnen
Vertaal m'n tranen in 't leven in lyrics zwevend woorden banen zich
Snel wegen in de geest met lanen en stegen
Binnenin huilt m'n hart z'n weg naar m'n vingers kan 't niet echter verzinnen
Hand om m'n pen, en m'n text kan beginnen
Sirene wenend zwaar naar m'n Brain
Van jarenlang een vreemde eend tot een maand op nummer één
Flashbacks van m'n jongenskamer jaren alleen
De dood van geliefden en viel met tranen ineen
Je breekt, daar, Wat wou je nou? als je verder gaat
En denkt, na: Hou jij van jou? als je nergens staat
Weg met leeg gepraat ga niet voor geld of de pegels
Ben me bewust van deze verses dus benut elke regel
Je hoort de Brain omdat je 't pure wou
Voor iedereen van Nederland tot Kaapverdië, Aruba, Bonaire, Curaçao
Suriname Turkije beaam 't blije van Marokko tot Vlaanderen
Afrika tot Aziatische wijken Zuid-Amerika, Europa, USA en wereldwijd
M'n wil blijkt, één vibe, Nas & Brain op één mic
[Hook: Nas & Brainpower]
Yo, all I need is one mic...

All I need
All I need is one mic...
Één (één mic) mic
Yeah, aha, yo…
[Verse 2: Nas]
All I need is one cup, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, touch alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three (shots)
From twin (Glocks) there's sixteen a piece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my dunns was holdin 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never get caught up, pain'll go through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, brothers roll up, (shootin') from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this all slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of (macs), too many (nines)
If y'all people really wit me get busy load up the (semis)
Do more than just hold it explode the (clip) until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
(Lead) flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these dude to war, lie 'em down
Cause we stronger now my peoples, the time is now
[Hook: Nas & Brainpower]
All I need is one mic...
Kom, kijk… en luister…
That's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic...

That's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic...
Één (één mic) mic
[Verse 3: Brainpower]
Alleen op hoeken van straten lees je boeken luister je platen?
Hoor politici weer oeverloos praten
Voel je verlaten en moet dan wel wraken
't goede verlatend, plaatsmakend voor woede door haten voel je gelaten
Wie gooit er roet in zaken?
Wie blijft al vloekende praten?
Wie heeft 't goed, en wie flatert?
Wie is bedroefd, en wie schatert?
Wie hoest er, wie gaapt er?
Wie proest er, wie slaapt er?
Wie doet alsof, is namaak?
Wie ploetert, wie hapert?
Zoveel vragen in een wereld banger en enger
En ben met verlangen verstrengeld op de klank van merengue
Voor speciale personen voel ik diepe liefde die prachtig is
MC ik niet voor niets en verdiep me dan in de Alchemist
Fuck 'n diss pas als ik rock op shit die pakkend is
Veel te lang ingeslikt tot m'n ziel naar adem snakkend is
Alleen vrede in m'n geest op stage met die ene mic
Wreed en hype, tekeergaand als een vreselijk beest
Schreeuwetuit!!! “Verschil Moet Er Zijn” de tyfus voor non-believers
Laat je niks wijsmaken peeps en ga voor wat je lief is
Je hoeft niet te doen alsof - die shit is jezelf
Zoek maar waar je maar wil, echt waar maar 't zit in jezelf
[Hook: Nas & Brainpower]
All I need is one mic…
Kom, kijk… en luister…
Aha
All I need is one mic…
Één (één mic) mic
That's all I need
Yo
All I need is one mic…
Kom, kijk… en luister…
That's all I need
All I need is one mic…
Één (één mic) mic
That's all I need…
[Verse 4: Nas]
All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, They don't understand
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin all that slick stuff, while my name is biblical
Wonder what my secrets is, enemies'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late I'm mad young I'm laughin' cause I'm a cool brother
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you brothers
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin' each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, (cop) would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, people throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Women left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon cause none of these brothers real
Heard they were, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin', the time is now
[Outro: Nas]
All I need is one mic… yeah, yeah, yeah
All I need is one mic… that's all I ever needed in this world, (fuck) cash
All I need is one mic… (fuck) the cars, the jewellery
All I need is one mic… to spread my voice to the whole world

{*speaking softly, gradually getting louder*}
Turn my headphones up, it's pure
Nuttin' gonna stop me now, Stillmatic
Tye Fyfe remix, you know?
(I'm here now, we here, it's your world)
Ill Will y'all
Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One person front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one love, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll probably make me flip
See my name in the hieroglyphs, like Osiris and Isis
Parables written inside papyruses
Ackowledge it, we been all tricked time to come out of it
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin' us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop (shot) again
Bus stop, glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Richochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I duck back, forget gettin' hit! {*more sirens*}
This is my hood I'mma rep, to the death of it
'til everybody come home, little brothers is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sent from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO FLY, WITH MIND POWER
THIS IS WHAT NAS IS 'BOUT, BROTHERS THE TIME IS NOW!
{*whispering again*}
Yo, all I need is one mic..
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. all I need
All I need is one mic.. yeah
{*gradually getting louder*}
All I need is one cup, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, touch alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three (shots)
From twin (Glocks) there's sixteen a piece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my dunns was holdin 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
Never get caught up, pain'll go through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, brothers roll up, (shootin') from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this all slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of (macs), too many (nines)
If y'all people really wit me get busy load up the (semis)
Do more than just hold it explode the (clip) until you empty
There's nothin' in our way - they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
(Lead) flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
THAT WE TAKE THESE DUDES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN
CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY PEOPLES THE TIME IS NOW!!
{*whispering again*}
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin' else in the world
All I need is one mic.. that's all a (nigga) need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic..
{*starting loud this time, getting quieter*}
ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'm ONE MAN
WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
Or wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin all that slick stuff, while my name is biblical
Wonder what my secrets is, enemies'll move on you
Only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late I'm mad young I'm laughin' cause I'm a cool brother
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you brothers
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin' each other
Up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, (cop) would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, people throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Women left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon cause none of these brothers real
Heard they were, tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin', the time is now
All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, (fuck) cash
All I need is one mic.. (fuck) the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world

[Verse 1]
In the Rotten Apple, take a bite taste the worm
Embrace the world of reality we're faced to learn
Coke connection drug bust, graveyards where thugs rest
I keep my mug blessed
, 
the evil is illegal substance sold
Roll mob deep, guns in the black Jeep
Mac-11's and legends, cracks in the streets
Patroller, gold money-folder, gun happy soldiers
Never sober takin over,
 
my blood is colder
Niggas respect violence so I become it
I'm from it, I even done it blunted so run it
Yeah son, you know what this is
Take it off [come on dunn, don't even come at me like that]
[Dunn, come on dunn]
[Hook]
Imagine this, no guns no knife
It's a one on one so now we gots to fight, son
Imagine this, no gun no knife
It's a one on one now we got to fight, yeah
Imagine that, no gun no knife
It's a one on one now we got to fight, yeah
Imagine this, no gun no knife
It's a one on one, son
[Verse 2]
Yo, I'm a cream fiend, with a mean dream
Brain full of schemes, my crew's rolling fresh out the greens
Give you what you never seen, the inf on the Mac-10
It's 2:10 in the A.M. in the streets of Queens
Try hard and die hard
Chances of survivin the game is like trying to feed Allah lard
A walk a piece with a deadly shadow
They want to blow me with the double barrel, found no sorrow
I brawl with Blanka, caught Bison in a thinker
Don't make hell your new home, with the blue chrome
Mistakes want me, suave fellow but raunchy
The soul of a cold body haunts me, I flee the country
But only to shed tears for years
Too wild for my own self, hoping help is near
Street fighting was cool but in school I brought a new tool
Duelin' with the devil, a rebel, a fool
[Hook]
Yeah, take it to the bridge -- Queensbridge
[Bridge]
Yo whassup money? [Yo yo do you remember this face?]
[Yeah yeah yeah, run these, run these]
*sounds of brawl* [
Break you down! Get broke!
]
[No hands, run that, run that, run that, no hands]
[Verse 3]
I hear Jake walkie-talkies in my sleep
Marked money I keep, play the bitches all week
I visualize Coups, alligators in suits
Elevators in my mansion that rises to the roof
Sippin eighty proof, watchin Juice
, 
but hold up
I see some brothers tryin to roll up, wishin I could fold up
It's hard to see their faces in they hoodies, I better boogie
Too late, I tried to swing when they jigged me, I'm out...
Yeah yeah kid, don't front, 360 degrees, knowhatI'msayin?
That's how it comes back at you. Queensbridge, that's how we live
South side, all that. New York, light it up, light it up
Yo yo 
you saw how I snuffed that kid
? [Yeah I saw that, I saw that]
You know how we steppin', 
that's how we do out here in the street fight
!

[Intro: Nas]
Large Pro., Nas. Traveling through your mind one time
Get bliss to this
[Verse One: Nas]
The greatest lesson ever learned, has yet to be taught
Niggas running outta court like "what the fuck they thought?"
It made me somber, my mans I just can't picture being locked up
They used to being mad fly
850i style
Cherokee, letters read Nas they could never bury me
But through me, my nigga you free
Truly, reppin' QB
My life is like a movie
The credits at the end
And the film plays again
The script is every rhyme I ever said
Off the gin
Bloodshot Hennessy eyes
Infinity drives
Without a sound Queens bound
Paully got a call for war out from 40
Meeting out in Beach Channel
With peeps from Hammel
Blunted niggas get roasted in they rides
Soak they tongues in Remy
Heat's in the 5 series high and leery
When those blue and white cars drive near me
Avirex, Gore-TeX wet with fly jewelry
Israelite original insight and lethal
First Hebrew
God sent golden Asian phenomenal
You can't say the name Nas without saying the honorable
Wealthy, Wall Street read the chronicle
I fuck big titty chicks
Who sip the Long Island City lix
Drunk off the Alize with Henny mixed
Mad niggas is jail like TCB teach me
Everything you see ain't always what it be
Hardly able to chill night ills feeling slight chills
Finding out that rich nigga got to write wills
High 'til I die Eldorado red pack the Uz-o
Pretty thug Last Don by Mario Puzo
[Verse Two: Large Professor]
Stages and places that we go through
In a lifetime, maybe more than a few
'Cuz one day you're A and the next you may
Have a brand new topic and see a new way
Like history, while it's repeating
I'm beating the drum on the dumb and blurry don't worry
The least bit
About shit when the weak split
The raw brain remains
Long range
This is possible I know and charge like a rhino
Bro, I gotta let this music go
For the maestro
Climbs higher heights yo
Season a bass line
And mind of a Bandog shrine
In hell, can't tell
All the times I fell
But can
Tell the thing called man I stand
In the eyes of the father tasteful like guava
Unravel and break down a tec and solve a
Problem, 
in no time you'll lose your mind
Tryin' to calculate the rate of the Large's incline
Out of nowhere, I go where few can go
On the strength I be rising on tunes and flow
With the flock very seldom
Words when I weld them
Connect for the perfect brew
I you

[Produced by Large Professor]
[Intro - Nas + [Grand Wizard]
[Hook]
(Grand Wizard) One time for your mind, one time
(Nas) Yeah, whatever
(GW) One time for your mind, one time
(Nas) Yo, whatever
(GW) One time for your mind, one time
Hey yo, Nas? Kick that fuckin' rhyme
[Verse 1]
Check it out
When I'm chilling, I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin' and root for the villain, huh
Plus every morning, 
I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes, some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Keep lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Htting up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rocking the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, 
well acappella rhymes'll
Make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella, fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Y'all niggas was born, I shot my way out my mom dukes
When I was ten I was a hip-hoppin' shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top, yeah
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Right, right, what up niggas, how y'all? It's Nasty, the villain
I'm still writing rhymes, but besides that I'm chillin'
I'm trying to get this money, God, you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold be starving make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'mma lamp, cause a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggas catching 3 to 9's,
 
Muslims yelling "Free the mind"
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
As a kid when I would say that out of town, niggas chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a nine, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a menace, yo, police wanna murder me
Heini Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand a lot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop, pa
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack a reverend
I contact 11 L's and max in heaven
[Hook]
[Outro]
[Nas] Yo, from ninety-two to ninety-nine
[LP] Yeah that shit was crazy fat Paul, kno what I’m sayin?
But check it, you gotta another verse for me
I want you to kick it, you know what I'msayin?
Kick that shit for the projects

[NAS]
Yea (House of Hits)
Finally up in this nigga
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal
To my seed, May I lead you into no breed of evil
In the categories and stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, Monkey do
A shorty sipping sunny dew
Now its V.S.O.P. in a G.S. thats mad smokey
Murder tree's, Crusin gun in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Marriot,
 Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell the hoes to hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom
And there's video taping of booming ass's on the zooming lens
Rolling on you non descript niggas
Your marked for death like colombians with bad coke that gip niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisting up the uwee if your skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili's bust
Chorus
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal
On the Real all you crab niggas know the deal 2x
[K-L from ScrewBall]
Now its verbal abuse cause the mic's in use
This is your sorry excuse
Get your neck put in a noose
K-L is quick to let loose, to make your blood count reduce
Over the snare drum
We reproduce like cum
Impregnating the track, making it fatter than it was
Giving life to idea
Through the verse is what he does
[Kamikaze]
See a close call about two clicks from my fortress
We rolling squad deep, on the Kawasaki hourses
QueensBridge got the drop on you niggas trying to toss us
We metal down now its time to show these clowns who the boss is
We live for the shit, Ain't trying to take no lossess
Accumalating to much cream for you to touch
Fucking welcome to my clutches, wipe the blood on off my chuckers
From the ruckus
Your gone and your crew still love us
Can't call it, I'm in love with this good life shit
I'm working with jewels, car, chicken clits, paying rent
Murdered Presidents, running wild, stacking in piles
Onyx pendants, and Rubied down shit from the nile
Kamikaze style, sought the antique three pound
Yo Nas, lets cop this brick and let the mobb supply the town
Chorus 2x
[Cormega]
(Play some treats on us)
Drugs in my shirtsleeve
The side bubble converti
Eyes low cause the lye blow
Five-oh know we dirty drive slow
Write a line sipping a glass of wine
The block is mine cause I am a live criminal mastermind
When I rhyme, I perfect this, niceness, I'm blessed with
Exhale precise shine like cocian white
Its the life of Pablo, Escobar niggas I know
With diamond rolexes, that drive infinit's and lexus
So send my enimies a message
My Tommy Hilfiger vest, is bullet proof, so when niggas shoot
I'm still protected
So never ask why I write so violent
My brain storm formed on a dorm in Rikers Island
I remained calm while you tried to bite my style and
When I performed niggas mic's went silent
To the kid who made my man ill will bless this
(On the real)
When I catch up to your ass you know the deal
[Nas and Cormega]
On the real
Chorus 4x

[Hook]
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally, oo-chie bang bang
Oo-chie wally wally
He really really really work my body
He really really really turned me out
He really really really got to gut me
He really really made me scream and shout
He really taught me how to work my body
He really taught me how to go down south
He really really tried to hurt me hurt me
I really love his thug and gangsta style
[Verse 1: Nas]
Yo we got chicks in the living room getting it on and
They ain't leaving till 6 in the morning
"O" is for oochie
Oh you ain't know how many O's in the bankroll
Sort of like the game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?"
But my name ain't Regis
Nas the one they call when they want their thing beat up
Honeys with bodies with Bravehearts, guns in the party
Waves, braids, and baldies, trademark's the arm
y
Is that Horse? It must be, I heard he husky
Yeah, there go Jungle, eyes red looking for trouble
And that's Nas dancing with dimes but who his man is?
The imperial thug, it's cold D Grand Wiz
We taking honeys to the crib tonight
Guarantee we gon' get up in they rib tonight
Check the new slang, it's changed, the Braveheart gang, man
When you see me pass then holler oochie bang bang
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Wiz]
Yeah what up ma
Take a look, you hypnotized
On how my long dick stretch your insides
For real ma, with your thick lips and thick thighs
Stroke both holes, pass it to Nas
Or pass it to Naish, or pass it to Jung
Or pass it to Horse
, 
then that ass getting tossed
Fuck a Hustler book, Penthouse or Black Tail
I got bitches sending my niggas flicks in jail
I fuck a bitch face more than her waist for real
And ain't no pussy like new pussy
 that's how a nigga feel
Bust three times, throw her the peace sign
, she sleep
Then my dick sleep and I ain't gotta call her for weeks
Long leg hoes, mo'head hoes, married bitches
Me and my dog fucking them both they got us switching
Is the nigga gangsta? Yeah, that's how I'm living
That's how I'm playing - I got these freak fucking hoes singing
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Jungle]
Little young thing go around my dick with your tongue ring
Deep throat my nine inch, gut from the front and
Grind from the side and fuck from behind and
Grab her hair slap her ass, 
she screaming like she dying
Make her cum four times without even trying
I'll beat that pussy up there's no denying
Hit her where she doodie at
, 
make the booty fat
Little cutie rat walking by with the doobie wrap
Tight blue jeans, Air Max, small Gucci bag
No loot and no job, stay home giving blow jobs
Like no prob, it's simple
Holla out the window it's the project nympho
Fuck my whole crew, you know how we do
You got that good pussy I can share with my people
Be a brave girl, do your thang
Let them titties hang, I'll have all the bitches saying
[Hook]
[Verse 4: Horse]
When it comes to sex I'm similar to the Thriller in Manilla
Bitches call me Horse the pussy filler
I'll fuck a big boned or slim chick
Beat that pussy up real quick then send home the bitch
Ain't no sleeping in my bedroom when Henny's in my dick
When Flex drop the bomb I bust a nut on this bitch
Deep throat, ceaser gold or pun wicked hoes
Who like the way I thug and the way I flow
I like head in the Benz, the four door or the Coupe
Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot
Like Nia Long in a cherry thong with the lights on
Sipping Perignon with Kelly Price on
I pull out my python, I hit it while my wife's gone
Long dick the bitch all night, I'll make her pussy sing the song
[Hook]

Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong wars! Killing each other is definitely played out. Being hurt from the lost of a love one was never cool.
Dear Young Warriors fighting the wrong war! I know that feeling, that frustration with life and needing to take it out on someone, any one. But....
We chose the dumbest things to go the hardest for.
 
I remember seeing deaths over 8 ball jackets
, 
Fila sneakers
, 
and name plate chains
. 
Deaths over "he say, she say"!!!!!
 
"I'm from this block or I'm from that block"
, or "my moms n pops is f*cked up now the whole world gotta pay"!!!
I remember feeling like I was the hardest "n*gga" breathing. And I couldn't wait to prove it. But let's think. 
What are we really proving??
 And proving what to who?? Everybody knows Chicago breeds the strongest of the strong but I just feel, me, being ya brother from another state feels your pain as if I grew up with you in ya very own household.
You have the ability and mindpower to change they way we are looked at. Look who's watching us young warriors, look who's throwing us in jail constantly, look at the ignorance in the world. Look at the racist dogs who love to see us down. Loving to bury us in the ground or in jail where we continue this worthless war on one another.
Young warriors
.... We are WASTING more and more time. 
We gotta get on our jobs and take over the world.
 
Cuz this movie left the theaters years ago, Juice, Menace, Boyz n the Hood , Blood n Blood Out, Belly!
When we see each other why do we see hatred? Why were we born in a storm, born soldiers, WARRIORS....
and instead of building each other up we are at war with each other
.. May the soul of this young person find peace with the almighty. I'm with you young warriors. You're me and I'm you. 
But trust me! you are fighting the wrong war.
-Nas

[Bun B]
Yeah, when I step in the spot, motherfuckers say "who that?"
Big Bun B, but you already knew that
Live from the state where they chop it and screw that
You hatin' on the trill OG, where they do that? (for real!)
Motherfuckers need to get off the dick, man
Fall the fuck back like a bike with no kickstand
Get out my mix man, just go' get you stuck
Deeper in the quicksand, with no easy fix, man
No tricks, man, those is for kids
Kush in my cigar, and hoes in the crib
Drank, and the 20 ounce froze in the fridge
You fuckin' with PA so you know what it is
I'm sittin on the fours that clack
Comin' down candy in the golden 'Lac
We gettin' to the money like it's Goldman Sachs
And we do it for the pimps that are holding back, let's go!
[Nas]
Look who crept in with automatic weapons
Reppin' QB till the death of him
That nigga that inspired lyrical tyrants like Kanye West and Em
Track record, goes back to the Essence
Smack adolescents who ask who the best is
I'm nasty like gas from a fat man's intestines
I pass it, you gaspin' for breath and you die fast
Gut 'em like a gastric bypass
But ya Nas advocates actors seemed to get typecast in the same role
Since 16 I ain't grow a day old yet my brain grow
Cocaine white Range Rov'
Tats on my body like an art exhibit
I did real good for a project nigga
Was once a Bacardi sipper, now it's Chandon
Fat blunts in the car with strippers
Guns in compartments hidden
I was real young little youth, a novice nigga
Blessings, bowed down, respected
Chowed down, now my food's digested
Pow pow, with my shooters are 
Techs
That'll bust louder than the noise that I just spit
Let's get one thing straight that my crown ain't for testin', testin'
Chop heads off like King Henry VIII
Guillotine to ya neck bitch
I'm a king in this thing, don't be dumb
Been in this shit since '91
Niggas can't fuck with the style I use
Your fate is sealed, no Heidi Klum
Calm now, was a wylin' dude
Studied cowards
 
and made power moves
Watched Wild Planet seen lions devour food
You can say that's how I move
A monster nigga, and I don't really like doing songs with niggas
There go my nigga Wayne
Let them niggas hate or like my nigga Drake say
"We ain't got time to respond to niggas"
[Shyne]
I'm a villain, I'm a villain, all that happens in the street
Poverty and desperation made me everything I be
I'm a shotta, when I pop up with them poppers burn ya block up
Call the judges, call the coppers, we takin' over Gotham
Word to Poppa
, 
Blood gang, five
It’s that Blood gang five, but green is the bottom line
I run this town, I ain’t gon' lie, they run they mouth, they ain’t gon' fight
They actin' like they ain’t gon' die until I let them 'llamas fly
Flatbush to Bed-do-or-die, from Watts to Larry Hoover Chi
Poverty and heroine, it’s no place for a juvenile
Put greed in our heart, it’s the green that we want
Cash Money is the company and Weezy the boss!
[Busta Rhymes]
They say I’m underrated, but un-compete-with-able
Understandable, being that my rating levels are unreachable
Anything said other than that should be silenced, unspeakable!
And the thought of you being nicer than me, unfeasible!
They ask is what I do ever gonna stop, this shit will never end
That’s when you hear a car crash in the vocal booth got 'em sayin' “there he goes again!"
See now they nominated a nigga to come and
Flatten everything now let me dominate it, nigga run
And they be knowin' that I be blackin' on everything
And make it complicated like a nigga constipated with a gun
I gotta make it what they want and wake ‘em when I come
And shake 'em and bake 'em and take 'em to another place
Ain’t no fakin’, ain’t no kind of mistakin' how I be breakin'
Up everything and be creating a s-s-s-situation when I’m done (DAMN!)
You see I spit National Treasure, discography rich
And I done killed more cats than curiosity, snitch!
Most of you niggas sorry and owe apologies, quick
What the fuck you niggas still hangin' around here for, you apostrophe bitch?
Okay, now enough of that, see now I’m out the door
Tunechi, thanks for giving us a whole 'nother classic with tha Carter IV

De nos jours, pas assez d'meufs Chunky
On finira tous alcooliques ou junkies
Si on l'est pas déjà, perso c'est pas des masses..
Que j'demande : juste une tombe à Pasadena
Mais y'aura pas d'écart
Mon gars FUCK ça déjà
Trop d'tantouzes, mon frelot, tout ça faut qu'ça dégage
Mes sociaux font de sales dégâts
Ici c'est ça, les gars !!
Pédale si tu casse les glaws, j'fous des boîtes dans la caméra !!
J'vais faire de toi un totem, un sacré putain d'artefact
Après ton macérage dans mon Marécage
J'te balance dans une cathédrale !!
Pétasse le Chakal avec la tchatche et des basses...mais c'est ça les bails !!

[Intro: Nas]
Here we are
Here we are
Yeah
This one right here is for the people
[Hook] x2
Sabali, sabali, sabali yonkote
Sabali, sabali, sabali kiye
Ni kêra môgô
[Interlude: Nas]
Hey yo D
Let's go all the way in on this one
[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a flag on a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids
, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the West
Will never move East
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord
[Hook] x2
[Interlude: Nas]
Yeah, Sabali. Thats patience.
 
That's what the old folks told me
Discovering the World before this World.
 
A World buried in time
Uncover with rhymes. It gets no realer
[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round
If the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things
That he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out
The root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze
And that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wet mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive? Against all odds, now?
[Hook] x2
[Interlude: Nas]
It's crazy when you feed people the truth you don't know how they're gonna react
You're scared of wrong doers, people that just ignorant
You're scared of the truth, be patient for now
[Verse 3: Nas]
Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the Earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? Who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hue? What's man? What's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the Lakers
In a world full of 52
 
fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'part of me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless.... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn
[Outro: Nas]
This goes to all the wisdom and knowledge seekers of the World
Sabali, Patience, yeah

[Verse 1:]
Nasir bin Olu Dara bis do Allah
Fist full of dollars in a dice game god
D & D glass cloth Kangols guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful
Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em
The first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Everybody's crazy
Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop
[Nas:]
Peace fuck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqó fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
Niggas get flashier houses more plusher
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a Glock they keep squeezing
Bullets stop in your sternum they stop you from breathing
I'm light year far your mouth get all white
When I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but
[Hook:]
[Verse 2:]
I know where niggas sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggas get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers fuck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggas back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggas that got prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation
Got pussy niggas get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggas would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe
I got some niggas with acid get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now
[Hook:]

[Nas]
Yo, this Esco

[Verse 1: AZ]
What's the deally,
 
I just touched grounds down in Philly
Brought a pound with me,
 
Feds
 
floating
 around silly
Tryna find Lynn; bitch supposed to be in the Benz
Parked in row ten,
 
her and that slow ho Gwen
Shoulda known she was a bitch that we both could'a boned
To post it alone, the ass had us both in the zone
But you know the rules, both been schooled by older dudes
I know the jewels no time for them thoughts, too much to lose
Just trying to vibe until them hoes role with the ride
Where's your joy and pride, you know little Des got your eyes
[Nas]
In the cut drop CLK, the top's up
Left the mall bought Little Amal the toy truck
Your boy's what, three-years-old now correct
He and my daughter age neck-and-neck, they future's set
Trees got me wet, in the background's an old cassette
Fly Stephanie Mills shit
What's the deal with, all this shit I'm hearing up top
You got arrested, 
shot a fair one with a cop
That ain't ya stee',
 
you usually low key when o.t
I'm only going off of what some weak bitch told me
[AZ]
That's some ill shit, hear that bitch go with her clique
[Nas]
Yo Dunn, I'll hit you right back cause the static is thick
[Hook: Dr. Dre]
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, then you through
We got your phone tapped, what you gon' do
Cause sooner or later, we'll have your whole crew
All we need now is the right word or two
To make all it stick like glue, we got you
[Verse 2: AZ]
We just hit the crib-o,
 
I'm curled up on this pillow
I'm still low, heard the ill news, these niggas killed Mo
The shit touched me, tryna chill just lit a Dutchie
From a while back, same foul cats who tried to bust me
Caught em sleeping in Spanish Harlem with some Puerto Ricans
Up in Washington Heights
 
right off the Deacon
Feel awful speaking, for some reason feel the phone's tapped
Alone with gats 
left with a vest to watch my own back
[Nas]
Keep your eyes open, stay wide, shit is mind blowing
Look for any sign showin one-time is knowing
About the dynasty, shit is not minor leagues no more
Cats bleed in this cold war
Son we took an oath, then this life took us both
We rich now, milk the whole cow, split the growth
Now I'm on the 
car doing
, headlights on
Fluid in the windsheild wipes gone this light storm
That's forming in the sky, you coming home tomorrow
Will you drive or will you fly - 
hold up, my other side
[Nature]
Yo son some other cats tried to ruin our plans
Sending two decoy bitches with pictures of you and your man
Asking your whereabouts, I gave em no leads
For all the nigga know them hoes fuck with police
[Nas]
No shit I'm clicking over, I'mma tell Sos quick
Son, them outta state bitches tryna get us both hit
That was Nate,
 he hit me last night late while in my ho's stomach
Said it's no hundred, we FBI's most wanted
So play the low; change your clothes, pack your bags
Watch what you say on this phone, get home fast
[Hook]
[AZ]
Yo it's all good
I'mma hit you when I touch down tomorrow son, word
[Nas]
Stay on-point, don't even use the phone
Just come to my crib yo, word up
[AZ]
Out

[Verse 1]
Everybody's an Enemy
Telling me lies and it's killing me
Why they all want to get rid of me
Everybody's my enemy
Several try to disguise the devil in them
Wanting to get into my cerebellum but I'm
Ready and willing to tell them that I can't f with them
Exhale so hard it got my chest swelling
Like my dick does when watching naked women
Do sick stuff on my porn collection on television
[Chorus]
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck Everybody this is to all of you all
Cause everybody is an enemy
Trust nobody
I don't know who to call a friend
They all just pretend to be
Fuck Everybody this is to all of you all
Cause everybody is an enemy
[Verse 2]
Watching my own back
Strapped in chrome, to my homies
Where the tombstones at, where the hoes at?
Cause to many didn't act like dikes, hermaphrodites
With benzene, amen
Look at the trash they 
biting
The life in times is kinda weaker
Like the time and life of the sandman
On Apollo theater
Imagine that another black with a hook
Who pulls the wack talent off the stage
I'm enraged
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
You fill your lies around me
And you think you won
You feel you can control me
With the things you've done
You think you can take me
You think you can play me
You're going to start to hate me
I feel that you disgraced me [x5]
[Chorus]

Uh, light something, stop fronting
[Verse 1: Nas]
How much money's enough? Think maybe like a trillion figures
Pray my daughter don't wild like the Hilton sisters
That'd kill me yo, filthy rich
My daughter pass it onto the next generation
Throwin' carnations at my tombstone
In my new home, meet mom's
 
in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on
Then we do a dance
Like my man Luther jam, but my verse came first
I stole change out her purse, now I wanna dig her up
Outta the earth,
 
too morbid, lean forward
Toward a new paragraph,
 Blue carrots, D-class
Strictly that kush in the weed bags
Tryna' figure out what 
Barry Gordie
 had put in production
Studio's smokey now
, hard like 
Davin Ruffin
Hit a spliff through a seance, and uh
Play on, 
[Hook: 
]
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Gotta' get your papes on
, playa on playa
Before it's all gone sip Don, tip waiters
Do y'all thing, menage, swing, baby
Spend dubs on your bruhs, gotta live crazy
Finest females I spit game on, I sprayed her
Get your pape's on, play on playa
Get your pape's on, play on playa
Get your pape's on...
[Verse 2: Nas]
Ruby red grapefruit juice with Grey Goose
Rubies in the Jesus piece,
 
pimped out like Snoopy
But a 
 thing,
 
my girl's stocking
Tied up in a knot top of my bean head
Billion dollar dream head, went from triple beams to digitals
Servin' fiends to minimal, sixty G's
No criminal, no mo', just mo' dough
Mimosas pouring, Oprah's earrings
On fingers while your girl performs cunnilingus
Cause' this big money aroma lingers
Barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade
Hot towel on the face,
 
hot models who vomit
After they eat so they can stay lightweight
Swallowin' my protein like an Ovaltine shake
Come through like Mo Green from Godfather,
 
so clean
Where I step I 'Clorox it',
 keep twenty G's
On both sides of the thighs, that's four pockets
Eighty thou to browse for the nicest price
But we ain't into buyin' conflict ice
That's the shit they stole from the Congo, and other black soil
True mack fo' you, 
 just spinning
Honey gave me a massage with a happy ending
Finest females I just came on and sprayed her
Got to get your pape's on, play on playa
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Snoop]
It's kinda hard for a playa like you
But let me show you how a nigga like me get revenue
What ya never do is punk out, what you better do
Never let the game get ahead of you, get a better view
Better yet, a better crew
, 
, I'm a marry you
Get ya holy, carry you, bury you, slowly
Roll me another blunt, stuff it
Lick it, puff it, tuck it, fuck it
That man, that game, that thing it busts
In D-O-Double-G we trust!
Yup, yup, young loc with the two steps
He creepin' with tha two Tec's, they sleepin' with two chicks
Right before we blast all you heard was two clicks (Bloaw!)
End of existence, for instance, rewind, replay it
Re-chop it, remix it, re-twist it
Goddamn D-O-Double-G, cuz, we missed it!
Travel slow, I'm an Indian, but not a Navajo
I smoke the big leaf, end all the big beefs
My hair in two braids, I'm the big chief
La-da-da, be-da-ba-da...
Yeah, break that down, how fresh you are?
The king from Queens, Mr. Escobar
Connect with the best from the West, yes-yes, you are
Oh my God, it's Snoop Dogg and Nas
Playa, play on

I had a ball the other night while watching 
, a VH1 (VIAB) biopic
 about the personal and professional trials of the celebrated hip-pop trio from the ATL (short for Atlanta, in case you didn’t know). The film took me down memory lane and really made me step back and realize the powerful impact that the group TLC, whose members consist of Tionne “T-Boz” Watkins, Rozonda “Chilli” Thomas, and Lisa “Left Eye” Lopes, had on the music world.
However, a reminder that I wish I did not have is the all too well story of the financial problems that plague artists with newfound success. 
Although you can chalk up the young ladies problems to the dysfunctional music biz, in particular the greed of their manager and label
, it still highlights the need for artists to take control of their FINANCES!!
One of the craziest highlights of the movie was when the group went “gangsta gangsta” over their money from the sales of their highly successful album, 
. Fed up with the runaround they were receiving, the young ladies along with their all-girl entourage stormed into their label Arista Records and held the founder and then president Clive Davis hostage and demanded payment. Who could blame them? The Grammy award-winning album sold more than 23 million albums worldwide bringing in $75 million, but the ladies were only paid 50 stacks each!
As a result of the group’s well-documented pimping, which was shockingly broken down by Left Eye during the movie, they were forced to file bankruptcy in 1995. Sadly, this wasn’t T-Boz’s only brush with the legal procedure. She filed for bankruptcy in November 2011 after reportedly being in debt for $800,000. It pains me to learn that T-Boz was a member of one of the greatest musical trios EVER that sold a total of 63 million albums worldwide, yet still manages to be so deep in debt.
The financial problems of hip-hop artists that the media salivates over just doesn’t make sense. Yeah, a lot of them brag about what Kanye calls "the good life" but as the adage goes, all that glitters ain't gold. Having the ability to navigate the financial world and possess critical money management skills would be of much help to artists. Let’s be real here. I understand that most artists don't have a steady cash flow and research has proven that their earnings come in chunks, sometimes with considerable time between checks. That said, it makes it ever so important to learn the survival skills of budgeting, saving, and investing so that they won’t face the “struggles” that has caught up many of their peers, including the following:
 Lauryn Hill is the much-celebrated hip-hopper of the bunch. The ex-Fugees star was recently released from prison after serving time for being $900,000 in debt to Uncle Sam AKA The Government for refusing to pay taxes on almost $3 mill in earnings between 2005 and 2009. Lauryn has since settled her tax bill after signing a $1 mill deal with Sony Records to release new music.
 
 The international pop superstar and selfies-lover is suing her former accountants claiming that their mismanagement of her finances cost her millions of dollars on her 2010 Last Girl on Earth tour. The case is currently in mediation so stay tuned!
 
 Boyee, the Illmatic star is facing a double whammy. Nasty Nas owes the State of Georgia over $1 million AND has a multi-million dollar federal government tax bill. Given this, the 40-year-old Queens rapper faced a serious consequence of having all of his tour earnings taking by concert promoter Live Nation (LN) to pay his debts. All of this is in addition to the thousands of dollars in child and spousal support that the he has to pay from his previous marriage to R&B singer Kelis.
 
 DMX has been struggling for many years with money and addiction problems. In July 2013, the former Ruff Ryder filed for bankruptcy days after his latest DUI arrest. For a rapper that sold over 30 million albums, he states in court papers that he has less than $50,000 in assets and is in debt between $1 and $10 million. What’s more, he is on the hook for more than $1 million in domestic-support obligations. When your monthly budget exceeds your spending to the tune of $5,000 to $5,221, you can’t help but have a poverty lifestyle. Hopefully his planned European & African tour this fall will go a long way in getting his financial house in order.
 
 Another hip-hopper bites the IRS dust. According to TMZ, the 39-year-old music mogul is sporting a reported debt of close to $800k for the 2008, 2010, and 2011 tax years. Unfortunately, the Money Ain’t A Thang rapper has a long history of tax problems. He recently paid off a $3 million tax bill from 2006, and in 2012 he settled a $500k tax bill with the State of Georgia. To add fuel to the fire, JD was close to losing the rights to his 
 catalog for failing to pay back a bank loan of nearly $5 mill.
 Circling back to 
, it appears that I wasn’t the only one that was tuned in on Monday night. The two-and-a-half hours flick was a ratings smash. It became the most-watched original movie in network history drawing 4.5 million viewers, and was also the highest rated original cable movie of the year among adults and women 18-49. If that wasn’t enough, the film sparked a huge increase in sales in TLC downloads. Their new soundtrack for the film 
 jumped from No. 43 to No. 5 on iTunes, and is sitting at number one on the iTunes R&B albums chart in the U.S.
If you haven't seen the movie yet, I would highly recommend that you check it out. And oh yeah, the controversial Lil Mama stole the show with her portrayal of the volatile Lisa "Left Eye” Lopes. Peace.

[Intro]
To My nigga
Who brought me in this world
Ha, that's right nigga
[Verse 1]
My old dad important to the family structure
A provider A God
My moms a queen, that universal team civalized us
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned down the Johnny Carson
Jumped out the bed
We grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother
Not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting yelling at each other
My papa played the street all day
Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone peeping out the window heated
But still I didn't see it
Mama hid it from us
We was kids younger
Till we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving his crib and mom's love
[Hook x2]
Papa was player, player wasn't papa
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (Shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down
[Verse 2]
So many kids I knew, never knew who Pap was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I popped up
He could have left
My moms pregnant shook to death but stayed
Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fist fight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches and weed all over my crib
, 
him and mom's relaxing
Next thing you know he packing
, so then I asked him
What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?
Papa why you butt ass from the waist
And who's this lady I'm facing
Dark skin you're not my mommy
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth closed and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand little me
What's in you is inside me
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3]
Pop's told me hold my own
Pop's told me value home
Could I help it papa was a rolling stone
Who loved the pretty brown round
Out of town bound
Trumpet in his jazz band, he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how, I do my thing now
I'm in the game now
Inherited his brainpower
To pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are same now
No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes
And beats that be pumping
Before he left he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed 'til we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life, next day they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed
I love you still, always will
Cause that's my nigga
Although you felt you was wrong
I still feel you kid
Life goes on

[Intro - Nas]
Yeah, yea, yea, yeah
Yeah, yeah, uh, yo
[Verse 1 - Nas]
Ladies love what I been through, blood on my Tim boots
Snub noses, club closes, down when my men shoot
But she can't stand, I'm sharing everything wit the fam'
That means them too, flat screen, Benz Coupe
Plus I entertain bosses
At my Spanish style, 
Lagerfeld furnished up fortress
But look at "Ms Thang", in Alexander McQueens
Giuseppe Zanottis, the sexiest bodies
And I, betcha she prolly, heard how I love 'em and leave 'em
But she still wanna suck 'em and eat 'em
Cause I'm a poet, a preacher, and a pimp wit words
A thief who stole her heart, a prince she deserves
[Kelis]
I should have known, by the way that you stared
Eyeing passes by, like your rich but life ain't fair, but ya
[Bridge - Kelis]
Make my record skip
Make my record skip
Make my record skip
Make my record skip
[Hook x2 - Kelis] + (Nas)
I would have never talked to you
If I had known you was a popular thug
Hey, popular thug (Ya damn right)
[Verse 2 - Nas]
I take, I don't ask for nothin'
You fake, I look past ya frontin', for cash I'm a glutton
I'ma, bad influence yo, I'll ya marriage ruined
By hangin wit me, you get ass from some new chicks
My life's so affluent
, cash & music
Honey's I hit, hear my songs and get mad and lose it
Cause I'm a sexed crazed bastard
I lace Kelis with a cushion cut engagement ring, we done, that's it
[Kelis]
I should have seen, in the way you touched my hand
Shuffling your car keys, it sounded like a gentleman, but ya
[Bridge]
[Hook x2]
[Verse 3 - Nas]
I don't mean mug or ice grill, cause I don't have to
My eyebrows shaped like a half moon, and I don't raise 'em
The kid you can't budge him, or phase him
My money's amazin', honeys Black, Puerto Rican, and Asian
What a made look, me and you. The king is hooked
Got you the Cayenne green Porsche, ta push
They off the hook, givin haters nightmares walking
You smothered by a popular gangsta, perfect boyfriend
[Kelis]
I should have heard it, in the way you said my name
While I analyzed your tone, you were formulating games, but ya
[Bridge]
[Hook x3]
[Outro - Kelis] + (Nas)
Hey, popular thug (Ya damn right)

[Produced by Marley Marl]
[Sample]
On the real, all you crab niggas know the deal
[Intro]
Yeah, finally up in this nigga
Let's pay homage to Illmatic
Let's put the crown where it's at 10 years
Never been done this real by nobody
[Verse 1]
To my seed, may I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, monkey do, shorty sipping sunny dew
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruising gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010
Don't make no noise cause we dirty, tell 'em hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume and mad boom
And there's video taping blooming asses on the zooming lens
Rollin on you nondescript niggas, you're marked for death
Like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggas
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts
[Interlude]
That verse is ten years old, nine and half years old
Street's Disciple, the rebirth comin at you this year baby, it's on baby
[Verse 2]
To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm 'bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sipping clear liquor with niggas, that talk sideways
Listening close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's 'bout the reed, counting everything the block see
We 'bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggas, doaded
Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggas
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again
[Verse 3]
Yeah, power to the people, death to the phonies
This beast to the mic one two check, y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you approachin me like how you, homie?
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male cause he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales cause they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While making cake with real golded plate rims on Humvees
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smoking less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke 'til I spitted vivid expressions
Of hard living ghetto children, of a lesser God
Religion was fast women, expensive cars
Y'all witnessin over 10 years, the best of Nas

Ayo I hit the Earth like a comet, Invasion
Nas is like the afrocentric asian
Right here with the amazing Green Lantern
Serious radio, y’all know what it is
NaS too real, NaS true king
You know the king
Cars with police radars on highways boppin
Bullpin therapy cell block dodging
Pissy stairways missed them days not when
They shut down the stores when I’m shopping
Used to be pop locking, train hopping
Face covered in stocking
Six pack Bud drinking gambler
Fuck them cameras in front of the man
Sing the hustlers mantra, hands of luck
More hits than gambling huff
I hollered Indosia, 40 belows covered the toes
I was a soldier with the Popeyes sippin Amota
Nigga honestly I call this a culture
My sister’s a snake, my brother’s a vulture
My mother’s the block, my father’s a ghetto piranha
Swimming with sharks my tones false settle drama
Obama, if the kids mirror you
We’ll all push Masaratis with the silver hue
They fear that connection
I rather die in a box than live safe in witness protection
Gotti was a racist but he still get praises
We don’t give a fuck, nigga gangsta is gangsta
Bricks come with Bill Clinton’s name on it taped up
Hollywood Lohan parties people they facing them
Kim Kardashian, body with the waist slim
Know some hood girls who did time that could take them
Rappers changing families, fags are all lost
I’m at the Waldorf, Vancleave under the sleeve
Save the small talk, I feel alive
New Porches Jordan number fives
Already said I’m the last real nigga alive
Nas, let my words guide you
From crips to piru this is survival
Turn my voice up
Let my words guide you
From crips to piru this is survival
Invasion!

[Nas]
This is my opening scripture
 - 
I've been preparing this album
My whole life,
 
might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satan's bombarding me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the Bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not bathe in napes
But we still filthy
, 
Supreme Court say we still guilty
This is the Genesis
, 
and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the Jena Six,
 
they put a noose on 'Pac
Now I'm defending Vick, and
 
free that nigger TIP
I'd take the grave or a bid
To let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's going to church
Plants packs on the man that's going to work
And build cases
, 
meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruiting all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call Escobar racist
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger hatred

[Eban Thomas]
It is absolutely silly, and unproductive
To have a funeral for the word "nigger"
When the actions continue..
We need to have a movement to resurrect brothers, and sisters
Not a funeral for niggers
Cause niggers - DON'T DIE {*echoes*}
[Nas]
Uh, yeah..
Yo, I'm creepy and crawlin,
 
in your sink and your toilet
I be drinkin from your spit
, 
anything cause I'm all less
An insect with four legs; people come in, I fake dead
Correction: 
I got eight legs
, climbin on top yo' plate, bed
Wherever I smell food, 
it could be even jail food
Stale food that's molded, a roach is what I am, fool
The ghetto is my land, fool, I'mma never be able to
Fly like a bumblebee,
 
try not, to be underneath
Your sneaker, pitiful creature
, I'm not afraid of
Your pesticide
 or 
RAID cause,
 in heaven's my Creator
I love it when the light's off, eatin from same knives, forks
From, ANY man's dinner, see my antennas
You can't win, you can't stand the crunchy sound I make
If you squash me, learn to live with me
How much your Ross Motel costin? Yo, we in the city
But yo, we everywhere! Check your house good, I bet we there!
LOOK THERE!
[Eban Thomas]
Niggers are like roaches
 - they're never gonna go away
Learn from them what we should not become
Cause niggers - DON'T DIE {*echoes*}

[Verse 1]
Black hoods, cops 'n projects
Sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Chains in top locks get ripped off hinges
Doors kicked off, drunks stag off smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
Vision blurry, cus buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
He's finished for the rest of his life, 'til he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
So many ways out the hood but no signs say out
Mental slavehouse
 where gats go off, I show off
Niggas up north, prison-ology talk, till they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
To hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
So your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on
[Hook]
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
[Verse 2]
Yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
They lit it up, *puff* *puff*, hit it up, *puff*
Now they dismantled
, 
think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
Watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hire Satan, United Nations quietly taken, toll on your soul
Take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, 
teach the girls karate,
 
school your sons not to hate
But to stay awake, cus the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
To the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
Might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
Perishin', brain dead from a Ericsson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
A cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said "go and see the world for myself, and my brother should follow
Pops was smooth, from his top to his shoes
Sang the blues, guitar strings he played smokin' his Kool
Duke Ellington hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
A fight, people screamin' cus somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this room, I'm hooked to this tune
Every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, speeding like amphetamine
Reading's what I should've done, cus my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
And I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and 
fo-fos
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows
[Outro]
Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Starin out of, of my window
Oh I, feel so tired
Oh yeah, outta my window
Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out
Lookin' out my window, oh yeah
Makes me, feel so tired
Outta my window, out my project window
Lord I feel, uninspired

Light it, uhh
Light it up, uhh
[Verse 1]
The whole, city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne
 
with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes? Fuck it, it's just an intro
Hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it
Write it, across the stomach spell God son
Life is like a jungle
 
black it's like the habitat of
 
Tarzan
Matter of fact, 
it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggas packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, Mack strong, couple of shots
Made the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin' the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin' they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that, be possible
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin' low with a bottle
I'm blowin' circles
, 
my state of mind purple
Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah... light it up, light it up, uhh
[Verse 2]
Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggas who got things, y'all ready to kill his mama
Everything you into is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin' soldiers
To pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryin' to be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin', still roamin' through the streets, that's real
You a survivor
, knowin' all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready
Trustin' your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love it's hate
, think of all the mothers at wakes
Whose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard
, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin' a mirror
Lookin' down a tear in jail, makin' weapons to kill ya
Weed smoke three tokes nigga pour more
 
Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood,
 
blowin' smoke, state of mind is purple
Light it up, light it up light it up, uhh
Light it up... light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh... uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh
[Verse 3]
These hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble
Reactin' before thinkin', they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated
, 
it's a fact that we sinkin'
When we should be climbin', in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggas rewindin'
Instead of movin' forward, to blow up so what's the science?
People shoutin', police pushin' the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier,
 
with meat hangin' out him
Am I hallucinatin' off the hazin'?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of, suspect faces
It's usually, two or three niggas who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make whoopee give me the pussy
Celie, Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness
, 
too much of anything'll hurt you
So, my state of mind's all purple

[Intro]
Uh
Crazy (crazy) Ah (ah)
Yo pussy kill me...
Huh (huh).. yeah (yeah) yeah..
Huh, huh, huh ,huh..
[Verse 1]
Pussy killed me when I was born (What?)
Pardon me, I'll rephrase it: departed mommy's womb decaying
I look at the bright side
The fact that I got a life side
Born '73 - September right Nas? (True)
Virgo child,
 
the first thing I learn is money makes the world go round
On this small planet, it's ten women to one man; I wonder how we manage
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures (Word)
Bitches even nastier, they throw at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky hoes lick a nigga's ass and nuts
Stupid bitch braggin 'til her baby dad went nuts (Stupid bitch)
Now he looking for me, two cars deep
Rolling up on nigga's, barrel out the window, asking, "You NaS peeps?"
I can't have that, two four five, nigga grab that
Pass it to me, sucker-for-love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me in trouble
I pissin bubbles
I thought I felt a sharp pain, better stick to rubbers
When laying hooker after hooker, day out and day in
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name 'em
Just a thought: we all fuck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent, fucking entertainers
And basketball players, the bitch is a ho
But still some of y'all a save her, put your dick in her throat
You just the nigga that done wifed her (huh?)
She drove you crazy, now your monkey ass wanna shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, (Damn) now you a life-er
And suicide notes you write her
Pussy kills
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Oh what a thrill
Inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong to handle it, it's real
Pussy kills
Backs shots keep a nigga open
Bitch a have niggas gun smoking
Pussy kills
[Verse 2]
My nigga James got married, same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was too stuck
Studied for her Masters, part time nurse
I'll tell you how superb the ass is,
 
but who's looking
I mean that's my man,
 
maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, sike
Cause James and me like I was with AZ like
Luke and Han Solo
 
fucking with niggas' girls' forbidden, that's a no-no
It's death and we real niggas, civilized gods
And their ain't too many niggas like NaS, I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheating
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life,
 even
Happy for James cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one,
 I told him he's lucky, we clown some
Rolling up 
dutchies
 
while watching Roy Jones in round one, he froze
Put his face to the tv, 'bout an inch close
Move out the way nigga, fuck's the matter with you, you blind?
He pointed to the front row, thought he was loosing his mind
She 'posed to be with her sick mother, left for the weekend
Was stressed when she was leaving
Now she's next to some nigga, cheesing
He's having trouble breathing (Gasping for air, coughing)
He pictured 'em making noises, grinding him and kissing him
Yelling, "Ain't no telling where her lips have been!"
Left her foul messages,
 
she came home no lesser than
Ten minutes later, then they start wrestling and screaming
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at that fight, you speeding
That's Vegas, this is New York, you bugging
I held up my hand for a dap but he wouldn't touch it
I'm like, "When you started acting like that? This is dumbness."
Gave me a crazy look and started swinging punches
I ducked, couldn't believe it, the nigga so whipped
He got his gat and started squeezing, hit two policemen
Neighbors dialed 911, they heard the thumping
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumping
Me and his wife dip to the floor she smiled strange
My comrade was breathing no more, they killed James
[Hook]

[Hook]
Queens Day, cash made on Hollis Avenue
Make it seem easy
[Verse 1: Nas]
From the days of arm call niggas hung around blocks and corner stores
Herringbone chains and fantasies rushing the door
Niggas from Rochdale popping shells, snatching rings
Fly from Shirt Kings, from Queensbridge to 118
I had my eyes open, stepping out into the world
So fiendish, 
Ole English 'til I hurl
, growing pains
A young kid, learning early how to know the game
USA Roller Skate rink, mobs and crews would take minks
Clean streets, hustlers, crack cocaine
Gave back by throwing block parties and basketball games
A lotta cash made on Hollis Ave., fast and change
High rollers was living, until the Task Force came
A lotta ghost towns and memories, bad blooded enemies
So many died with the same gangsta pride that entered me
Peace to them old timers, they who taught us
How to stand strong and pass it on to the sons and daughters
We all glow, and I'm proud to be all that I know
Q-B-O-R-O, nigga, who I die for
Survival, how we came a long way in solidarity
Don't let nothing try an spoil this day
To Run, D and Jay it's love and my thug salute
Cause real love's the only thing that comes above this loot
Carhart jeans, it makes me think of LL's Troops
Let's celebrate, it's Queens Day, this one's for you
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Run]
Some come out they hometown and they never get dealt
But three teens from Queens took over the world and never let go
Just regular cats you know that just happened to blow
Not anonymous with Hollis, Jake, Darrell and Joe
Ay yo, we made so that others could grow
Look at LL, A Tribe Called Quest, Mobb and Nas Esco
Ain't taking credit, we showing pride, look at us now
Got haters mouths all open wide, wondering how
In some cases the only thing that father and son
Have in common is they love for Run
Been the illest since day one, I'm too advanced to ever be caught
Who's more legendary than me... that's what I thought
And if somebody wanna test mine, yo, watch this
Peter Piper picked peppers...
And see I knew you knew the next line, and I bet you said it
It's been a minute, I'm still the king of the world so don't forget it
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Prodigy]
This is for my Q dogs who live the block life, pa
We grew up on Old English, Summertime Roy Wilkins Park
Used to be the shit, why they have to stop
On the Ave niggas looting all the jewelry spots
Hit the Shirt Kings for an ill airbrush top
That'll match my Cortez Nikes
Niggas getting robbed at the back door coming out with bags
We used to get our gold fronts from Eddie's gold caps
What y'all know about that, I bet the whole Queens do
Around '86 with the chrome bass crew
The young guns and Lost Boys made the news
Queensbridge is story in two, the story is true
So let's party for the borough and shit
And everybody come outside, cause it's Queens Day kid
[Hook]

[Nas]
Slick Rick chains ill nigga
Get brains with the fucking Hilfiger nah
Shit changed I gotta rock something flier
MacGyver get outta shit smooth like that, gettig higher
In these kicks, prince sneakers and jogging suits
Robbin troops, while my revolver shoots
Chinky eyed, devilish grin
Purple range rovers, waking up with hangovers
God damn I need my brain sober
So I jump up in the ride and slide
Me and my nigga Jung, Clue just called he got the purple 5
Damn niggas is live, Queensed out
Got to put the Carhartt jeans on
I'm fiend out, til this light green Cali weed
Hennessy 'dro, 
used to only cop dub sacks but now I cop a O
Six double O, I trick a couple hoes
Get 'em in my car, dirty shit on my fucking floor
Clean that shit up yo, throw it outside
Took about four hundred G's to cop the bulletproof ride
Bentley Azure, yo we on the world tour
We got a show on, the top of the coliseum, open doors
Let them 
Rockaway
 niggas in
Queensbridge startin' shit, chill, calm it down, we got to blend it in
School of hard knocks shirts, choppin' quarts
From the 
Hurst
, yo 
corona
 play the sideline, yea it works
Yo when we put it all in the same fam, yo round up the queen's click
Check out the game plan
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Queens niggas rock ice and smoke hyrdo
We keep heat for the beef, it never hide yo
Young niggas gettin cash and cop pies yo
Queens bitches stepped it up with thick thighs yo
[Nas]
Columbian brown skin, Queensed out from public housing
Comes the one known as the God's Son child, rappers is bowing
Look at 'em, they roll me red carpets
Praising me as one of the dead prophets
When I talk these niggas heads bobbin
Straight out of Queens with TNT, they did their first drug sting
With 1-800-CopShot, thinking it was first scene
With D.A. and cop killings laws was made
10 G's to a witness, who've seen a cop get sprayed
What's on the AGQ club or club Mercedes
Sunrise, movie theaters to chill with our ladies
Load up the 80's cause cop killin Queens is crazy
40
 to 
Baisley
, 
Q-Gardens
 to 
Woodhaven
To AQ, the brew, the borough that Gotti was made in
Whips on the 
Van Wyck
, Queens day or 
Shea Stadium
Anything that's transported to New York
Got a come through the gates of either 2 airports
Kennedy and LaGuardia, we come through to body you
Bloodhounds follow you; wolves will get on top of you
Push twin Camaros, paper here to Somalia
Blaze off double barrels, shells follow you
[Hook]

Nas:
I'm letting my people know why I'm not at the Summer Jam. I've been bamboozled, hoodwinked, and the whole nine. I was told and begged to do the Summer Jam. I was begged to come to Hot 97, cause I had a hot new record that nobody wanted to support except for the streets. I was told to come there and save Angie Martinez' job. I was told to come there and help the ratings at Hot 97 by Flex and the rest of the crew over there. I'm here to let my people know, all my Hip-Hop community people know that I was dissed this morning by Hot 97, and told what I couldn't do on the show. It's really outrageous and really shows that the wrong people are in power. This Hip-Hop thing comes from the streets. We need our freedom. If y'all ain't gonna fight for your freedom, y'all just gonna be like them sucka artists that just go up to the radio station and kiss A-S-S just to get some airtime, or just suck 
Flex
 or suck 
Clue
 and 'em, tryna get on their best sides so they can play your record. C'mon, man, take Hip-Hop back into your own hands, man. Throw a party in the streets for free. You know, make it safe, hire the Nation of Islam or somebody to protect it. It's time that we take it back into our hands, because when it's being held in bondage and slavery, it's really a big smack in the face to Hip-Hop and all the people who love it. You gonna tell Nas, me, myself, what I cannot do on a Summer Jam stage when it's been done--the same acts have been done
Power 105:
4 or 5 years in a row
Nas:
4 or 5 years in a row. And last year it happened to be that 
the diss was toward me by Jay
, and he was all high and mighty. Then I dropped the 
Ether
 napalm bomb, and their whole crew was running like roaches. And now you got that station over there crying because he lost, unanimous decision he lost. They played his records like he was dead, like it was a Jay-Z memorial--not saying he was. Don't get me wrong, y'all, I'm not wishing that on any man. 
And that's my brother
, but I'm saying--
Power 105:
You just looking for a fair play
Nas:
A fair play. And it's really out of hand, y'all, I'm not going for it. It's not gonna happen. This is a perfect opportunity, you have the alternative to choose any radio station you want to choose. And Power 105 plays everything: old school, new school, if you want to listen--
Power 105:
Pimp Juice! Mike Saunders, Pimp Juice!
Nas:
Yeah, big up to my man Mike right here who let me come up here. Big up to my man Donnie Ienner, everybody at Columbia Records who's totally behind my back. David Belgrave, everybody. The whole crew
Power 105:
We behind you, Nas
Nas:
And especially right here
Power 105:
The streets is behind you. Because you know what, after this, you probably ain't gonna hear none of your records over there. But it's okay, you know why? We have over 1200 stations, and we gonna hold you down
Nas:
That's love
Power 105:
I know Colb's gonna make a few calls. Mike's gonna make a few more calls. I'm gonna 2-way a few cats. Because we definitely appreciate this. This is what this is all about. This is real Hip-Hop, y'all. This is not synthetic Hip-Hop
Nas:
This is not synthetic. I have my freedom of speech, I'ma say what I want. I'm not worried about a record. I turn on that station, I hear people, rappers on there, talking about their record sales--that's played out--their rims on the truck, I mean what does that have to do with our community? What does that have to do with anything real? Let the rappers talk about it on their records. I don't wanna hear about rims on a truck. 
I don't want to hear the radio disc jockey making records that's terrible
Power 105:
Woah
Nas:
I wanna hear true Hip-Hop music. Nah, for real, man. This is real
Power 105:
This is true which is why I'm saying "ooh."
Nas:
You gotta realize I ate it. They had a Takeover show. And that was the song, ladies and gentlemen, the wack record Jay had trying to come at me. They named a whole show on that station "The Takeover." And I ate that. They didn't worry about my feelings when he made a record dissing my daughter's mother, with derogatory things about women in it
Power 105:
Two records
Nas:
Yeah, Jay just making records about how much he hates women, which really makes me curious. And I'm sitting here, they just support that and support everything he does. But when Nas, 
God's Son
, answers him back, they team up with the evil. See, it's a whole evil empire funded by a bunch of other evil empires, 
Def Jam one of them
, that's giving them money to play all their artists' records. Meanwhile the struggling artists have to try to recreate records that sound like Jay, and they're destroying themselves. If you listen to 90% of the rappers, they're not even creative. Pick up a Stillmatic album. Listen to the song Rewind. Listen to the song What's Goes Around ("comes around")
Power 105:
Listen to One Mic
Nas:
Listen to 
One Mic
, my people. Let's get real and be creative. I buy these people's albums, and they ain't talking about nothing. From 
Cam
 to everybody. I mean, I like Cam and everything. He's a good lyricist, but 
the album's wack
. Y'all brothers got to start rapping about something that's real
Power 105:
About life, man
Nas:
Nore
, my man, Nore, I love you Nore. Step your rap game up. 
Nelly, you trying to battle KRS-One
. Don't follow Nas, man. You can follow Nas if you're going to be creative. God's Son--yo, my next album coming out to school a lot of rappers on how to be a man, because these brothers got--they let Flex and them dictate what's supposed to be hot. That's why I'm here to let y'all know why I'm not at Summer Jam. I ain't no sucka, man. I'm right here, I'm made from Queensbridge
Power 105:
Let's give Nas a round of applause for standing up for the Hip-Hop community
Nas:
This is for the Hip-Hop community. I don't want nobody get it twisted
Power 105:
I'm cosigning everything
Nas: Yo, word is bond, I don't want nobody get it twisted. Word is bond. This is all about people know that I did not diss my fans there at Hot 97. I was told this morning what I could not do
Power 105:
And that's why you're not closing the show
Nas:
I'm not gonna close the show. They begged me to be the headliner, because Jay is mad at them, he got a fit with them, a little emotional attitude
Power 105:
Of course, cause he came over him and made the Power Switch. That's what that was all about
Nas:
He got a fit with them. They begged me not to go to 
Wendy
's station because Wendy was slaughtering Angie Martinez. They was like, "please don't go there, Angie's not about to have a job." Don't confuse me into the Wendy Williams-Angie beef. I make rap records. They got me in the middle of that to boost up their ratings, and then treat me like a crab today, which is not surprising, which is a reason why part of me feels good for not showing up, when they told me what I could not do, and that I could just take it or leave it and walk, and just treated me with total disrespect. So that's why I'm here letting my people know. It's time to be real y'all. Make your own outlets, man. Listen to 105, make mixtapes, listen to Kay Slay. Go get Hip-Hop without dealing with that station over there
Power 105:
There it is, yo. Or you can get yourself a Nas album
Nas:
Get a gun and get real. Get some balls, man. You rappers, get some balls. You rappers are slaves

[Nas]
Aeyo Queens get the money
Niggas still screaming, paper chasing
Where presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations
Over steak with Masons
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters
Their daddy's faceless
Play this by your stomach
Let my words massage it and rub it
I'll be his daddy if there's nobody there to love it
Tell him his name's Nasir
Tell him how he got here
Mama was just having fun with someone above her years
Niggas is still hating
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming
He'd rather floss with diamonds
They pray "please God let him spit that Uzi in the army lining
That shorty doo-wop rolling oo-wop in the park reclining"
Take 27 emcee's put them in a line and they're out of alignment
My assignment since he said retirement
Hiding behind 8 Mile and The Chronic
Gets rich but dies rhyming
This is high science
Now add 23 more from Queens to B-more
I'm over their heads
Like a bulimic on a seesaw
Now that's 50 porch monkeys ate up at the same time
Nasty Nasdaq
Y'all going to bow holmes, it's Dow Jones
.80 cal chrome
Needed time alone to zone
The mack left his iPhone and his 9 at home
My queen used the milkshake to bring y'all to my slaughter houses
I do this for the group home kids in boarding houses
This is that nigga shit that's on the album
For the niggas inside the chalk line in 40 houses
Bring back Arsenio
Hip-hop was aborted
So Nas breathes life, back into the embryo
Let us make man in our image
Spit it, I'm Huey P in Louis V at the eulogy throwing Molotovs for Emmett
You ain't as hot as I is
All of these false prophets is not messiahs
You don't know how high the sky is
The square mileage of Earth, or what pi is
I'm the shaky hand that touched George Foreman in Zaire
The same hand that punched down devils that brought down the towers

[Lil Jon]
Yeah!
Bravehearts!
Yeah!
That boy Nas!
Yeah!
Me I'm your boy Lil Jon
Yeah!
Right now we going to talk about these niggas!

The letter N, short for Nasir
More drama than the President with North Korea
Gettin Krunk wit Lil Jon, he da livest in the south
Fuck around and you get wires in your mouth
Cowards I despise and my power keeps on risin
Niggas try to hate me but they keep recognizin
Who's the next label I'mma bury
CEO's, rappers and A&R's go to the rap cemetary
And ya all got guns but ya scared to use 'em
Six million ways to die, nigga choose one
I'm a Braveheart I'll be right here
Y'all talk shit but I smell fear, motherfucker!
[Hook]
[Jungle]
Ay yo, all these niggas they afraid of the Bravehearts
I'll take a razor open your face up
I tried to tell these niggas we don't play
I run up on you broad day with a A-K
Cornball I can make your heart beat stop
Pop pop your body drop from a couple shots
When you see me in the street, we can handle the beef
If you see me in jail you know you dead meat
I be fighting and stabbin, shooting and laughing
My ratchet blast on top of you bastards
Committing sins in Cincinnati
We'll drive by in all black caddy's
A 21 gun salute
Your last words be, please Jungle don't shoot
Pussy, 
I'll put a slug between your eyes
And stand there and watch your punk ass die
[Wiz]
I'm fuckin' wit them, Bravehearts
My niggas is coming we just don't stop
Yall niggas is running I'm just goin pop
I twist up my gun up and slap your mouth
With Lil John down south
My religion is green motherfucker too late
Since birth, I'm cursed, the worst motherfucka in da state
Time and time again you niggas back down, laugh now
Fuck ya numbers nigga ya'll all fake
The hunt is on, fuck if I'm wrong, test my dead arm
Robbery, heavily armed, might leave him gone
Bang him duff him, actin like he don't know what's going on
Hang em' rush em' get his clown ass his teammates wrong
And oh he got a 22, give him the gauge the brave way
God ain't going to save his bitch ass today
Wait I'mma Braveheart I'll be right here
Y'all talk shit but I smell fear, mothafuckas!

[Intro:]
Where my real niggas at
Theres a lot of real niggas out there
Theres a lot of real niggas everywhere
Thats why you don't fuck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin
Not botherin nobody, until one motha fucka fuck with em
And then all hell break loose
[Hook:] x2
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones that get killed
It's wild where we walk kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga
[Verse 1: Grand Wizard]
Well known gangstas, in trust
That we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motha fucka beggin for more
Its the reason
Standin here shakin, hatin the haters
They watchin my paper
Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes
Now what the fuck you think he saw before he drop
Nigga standin there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show yawl motha fucka's respect
Plans connect
The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck
More Jazz than Hornacek
I blast and leave your corner wet
Straight on top of ya
Spittin like the trench coat mafia
In a school yard we make it hard
Was poppin yawl
We made our change was stoppin yawl
They spray your names rest in peace on the ??? wall
[Hook:] x2
[Verse 2: Horse]
I wave gang signs at the youth, thats down for the cause
Cling them things in the ??? you betta get yours
Time is runnin out
Your streets is gettin smaller as we speak
Giuliani
 
turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit of days we did this
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin, not killin everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles
Theres no tomorrow its the bottom of the 9 9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch thats fine
My hearts full of braveness so who the fuck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin
You can find us in the hood; thuggin and regulatin
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin
You can find us in the hood; thuggin and regulatin
[Hook:] x2
[Verse 3: Jungle]
We here to eat food, my peoples, be lethal
Shots in your body make you see through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life,
 big never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin bigger
Celebs on the V I respect that nigga
Rege on the regular chops is up; like a editor
Come through on man gang like the predator
If yawl wake I'll wet it up
Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin at you
Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what
Ill will the label
Bravehearts yawl scared of us
[Verse 4: Nas]
Yo when those niggas ran these niggas stayed
With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick cause we paid
Don't even rep Q B
You ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin
And its good night
Know how much force this is
Jungle, Horse, and Wiz
Notin but horses kid
We go to war for this

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime groove
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you
I see you standing there
So lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you’re home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself
[Verse 1: Nas]
3:45AM can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive
Guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep making my millions
Can see myself in Presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passing blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you’re too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you’re too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And outgrow women you love and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mil
All you need is some skill
Then it’s grindtime
Imagination better than knowledge, ask Einstein
It’s all in the mind
Nasty the nicest
Just one minute after it's heard, you all will recite it
You all will repeat it, you'll call me a genius
If you didn't now that I said it I forced you to think it
Write in my little vignettes
, 
sipping Moet
Bitch when you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me Olu’s son
Now he’s Nas' father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don’t understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood will change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I’m ostentatious
Get out a gangsta’s business, seems to me your thoughts are basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, 
golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors your 
Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbors, growing up I’ve seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights can rival your Foamposites
Don’t make me pull my Lottos out the closet
[Hook]

[Chous: Emily]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
[Verse 1: Nas]
By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggas pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said "My son ain't no motherfuckin' hoodlum"
They judged us, thinking that we dumb cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggas wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)
[Hook: Emily]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?
[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know
[Hook: Emily]
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa
[Verse 3: Nas]
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggas gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
In her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next
[Hook: Emily]
Emily harmonizes as Nas talks:
"Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all. So what? To all my niggas with they
Kids that love they kids, man. All the daddies out there
To all the niggas that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know. Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us. Gotta forgive us. For we know not what
We do. Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
Shit. Just man... man."

Yeah
This is how we redefine, the music
Let's go
[Verse: Nas]
Yeah, ya'll know I gets it on, sip on Dom
Clear the throat, wet the palate
Compose a ballet, then expose a rare talent
The kick drum will have you numb, the snare's valid
That's how Premier styles it
Yeah ya'll know he gets it on, that's a given
Every song I've written, make the sky clear blue
Like the beginning scenes of The Simpsons
Dominions of the British Empire
We'll listen to Bach, with tea and biscuits
Preem revisits, songs centuries old
Hip-Hop; symphony's orchestras out cold with it
You know the flow's administered
By the deputy, rhyme prime-minister
Sir Nas, I'm certified
Please be seated and your shirt and tie, dress is on
Arrive early, when the curtains rise, bet it's on
A certain etiquette involved with this
Unlike any other music genre is, bring the drama in

[Verse Two] [Apathy]:
I'm an abomination
An atom bomb, my verse is atomic
Approaching the planet with power of a hurdling comet
My words are demonic
I'll make the pope convert to Islamic
Converse with the prophet and tell the planet Earth that I'll drop it
Into a bottomless black hole
I'll body your wack flow
A cannibal with bottles of blood instead of tabasco
The bastard who bathes in battery acid and sewage
I'm secret as druids
I cover hoes with bodily fluids
I'll leave a city in ruins
This is not an illusion
I'm a product of parents abusin' a lot of hallucinogens
I sacrifice hoes the bed gettin' broke
I'm a beast with the body of a bull and the head of a goat
I lunge for the throat
Psychotic when my lungs full of smoke
A dragon puffing on dope
Who live in dungeons and motes
See us covered in cloaks
A dagger stuck in your throats
Call me Pac Man I turn these motherfuckers to ghosts

[Nas]
I think I can remember some...
[Verse 1]
Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Nasty though, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
That drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
Used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker
[Hook]
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
And all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes
Remember the times I fucked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind
But none of them could touch you
[Verse 2]
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when fucked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, 
bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Thank God I got bank god, so fuck pimpin'
Fuck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
Are we tempted

[Verse 1]
Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers,
 
we all stare
At the out-of-towners, they better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryna watch us and knock us
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock
For the fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done,
 
won't even run about Gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a Tec out the dresser,
 
police got me under pressure
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moet drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up blessed
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennesey while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom then I'mma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too
 with Swoop, 
Bokeem
My brother Jungle,
 
Big Bo, cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it,
 
Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
'Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, one love
[Hook]
[Outro]
One time for your mothafuckin' mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
That's living the real fucking life and every projects, all over
To my man, Big Will he's still here
The 40 side of Vernon,
 
my man Big L.E.S
Big Cee-Lo from the Don, Shawn Penn, 
the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters,
 
the 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas

my man Cormega,
 
Lakey the Kid
Can't forget Drawers, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead, Black Jay, Big Oogi
Crazy barrio spot, (Big Dove),

And my man Primo, from Gang Starr
'94 real shit y'all, (Harry O), fuck y'all crab-ass niggas though

[Hook: Amerie]
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
[Verse 1: Nas]
LIFE, dead presidents
, 
devilish meant
Overthrow king from they thrones cause of their negligence
DEATH, real shit'll start comin' to light
Niggas you ain't like dickin' your wife, WHAT?
Kind of undermining, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan
HEATHENS, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons
But glory go to God, y'all BENEATH HIM
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat
He'll show you streets where them big dealers DROVE AT
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap
Blocka-blocka-blocka -- OH
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows
Everything a hood brother thing he needs
 -- YO
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap
And I'mma use that for the
[Hook: Amerie]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
[Verse 2: Nas]
Burnt-out, kicked to the curb
So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' REAL FAST
In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the PAST
Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash
Lawyer want CASH, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gell
They burnt a range with a 
Molotov COCKTAIL
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Them cops SWEAR, my little nigga told on me
I'm thinkin, "Hello, where's the L-O, V-E"
Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names
Word to his pops with elephant veins
They both locked-up still, word to Will
I'll make it and chill for the
[Hook: Amerie]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life
[Verse 3: Nas]
My man gave his mommy coke
So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke
DAMN NIGGA, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms
So she don't have to bone for DIMES?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects
Where dogs shit and PISS
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics
Mighta been stupid, 
but I got far from twenty-six BARS
To ten LP's
, what can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?
I'm NAS, on a track that's unorthodox
Like my life coulda been offed by THE COPS
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale
About the rest
[Hook: Amerie]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

[Lake] uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!
[Nas] Uh, ghetto children singing "singing"
[Nas] See they eager to learn "uh hum"
[Nas] how to become the next world leaders "Bravehearts"!
[Hook: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare is all fair, love and war, for the cause
I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare is all fair, love and war, for the cause
I gotta take you off here
[Verse 1: Nas]
Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them
Gotta shoot only if necessary
Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
Where Aryan nations ain't having integration, we so blind
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, "Jesus"!
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up
, the armies is school
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Ghandi was a fool
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, fuck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Lake]
My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills
For fish scale, to cop guns
, 
the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
Fuck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's
Black fatigues and ? on the sofa
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, fuck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga
Only killas know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police,
 nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas & Lake]
[N] 
Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers

[N] The women plays important part of our life force
[N] So what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war
[L] Uh, And listen more talk less

And be ready to die for what you believe in

We the lost children of Israel in this western world region

You ain't a man you a coward if you can't support the girl you put a seed in

[L] Conceal your form, cover your tracks
[L] Stay prepared I don't care if no one's spared

[Verse 1]
Listen up gangstas and honeys with your hair done
Pull up a chair hon', and put it in the air son
Dog whatever they call you, God just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending
The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closing this chest of a nigga
Now he back to square one
Screaming, "shoot don't please"
I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewinding a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch
My caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Going reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out something crazy like, "go he there"
Sitting in back of this chair, we hitting the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie,
 
it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinning records backwards of
 
AC/DC
I give my niggas dap,
 
jump out the van back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, "outside right we"
So with my mouth wide, holding my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for you
Cause Jungle said,
 
"block your on enemy's the"
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang
I'm laid in the bed thinkin bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, "no hell"
She talking bout, "me kiss"
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
Started sucking with no hands, a whole lotta spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, "stressed really I'm"
Picked up her Gucci bag and left a nigga behind
Walking through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three, to two, to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, "son we found that nigga we gotta kill"
Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me
Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now
Let's kill him
"Yo, this Nas, leave it; peace"

Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn on my hide
I should've known
We can't repair what we broke
But I held you close, too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
[Verse 1]
I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any fuck time either
Hefner minded like
 
I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge, cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket, not enough blacks have it
Who should I date --
Project chick or Cuban actress?
A White chick, they might flip talking that Blackness
Should only attract Black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that
You'll be mad forever
Never played you
I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever
, 
know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams
[Refrain]
[Verse 2]
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper
I done went to hell and back
You always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song
You want to kill em right
You resent me every time I make a million right
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on to Martin Scorsese Mean Streets
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a fucking liar

Sittin’ up drunk shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I’m lost
Losing focus what a n#%$a still hustin’ for?
My seed is straight the family’s settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
—Nas, Suicide Bounce
One of the most difficult decisions that a CEO ever makes is whether or not to sell her company. Logically, determining whether selling a company will be better in the long term than continuing to run it stand-alone involves a huge number of factors, most of which are speculative or unknown. 
And if you are the founder, the logical part is the easy part
.
Indeed, the task would be far simpler if there were no emotion involved. But selling your company is always emotional and deeply personal.
Types of Acquisitions
For the purpose of this discussion, it is useful to think about technology acquisitions in 3 categories:
**Talent and/or Technology**
—when a company is acquired purely for its technology and or its people. These kinds of deals typically range between $5 and $50M
**Product**
—when a company is acquired for its product, but not its business. The acquirer plans to sell the product roughly as it is, but will do so primarily with its own sales and marketing capability. These kinds of deals typically range between $25M and $250M
**Business**
—when a company is acquired for its actual business (revenue and earnings). The acquirer values the entire operation (product, sales, and marketing) not just the people, technology, or products. These deals are typically valued (at least in part) by their financial metrics and can be extremely large (e.g. 
Microsoft’s $30B+ offer for Yahoo!
)
This post is most applicable to business acquisitions with some relevance to product acquisitions and will be fairly useless if you are selling people and/or technology
The Logical
When analyzing whether or not you should sell your company, a good basic rule of thumb is:
If:
A) You are very early on in a very large market
AND
B) You have a good chance of being number 1 in that market
Then you should remain stand-alone. The reason is that nobody will be able to afford to pay what you are worth, because nobody can give you that much forward credit. For an easy to understand example, consider Google. When they were very early, they reportedly received multiple acquisition offers for more than $1B. These were considered very rich offers at the time and they were being offered a gigantic multiple. However, given the size of the ultimate market, it did not make sense for Google to sell. In fact, it didn’t make sense for Google to sell to any suitor at any price that the buyer could have paid. Why? Because the market that Google was pursuing was actually bigger than the markets that all of the potential buyers owned and Google had built a nearly invincible product lead which enabled them to be number 1
Contrast this situation with 
Pointcast
. Pointcast was one of the first Internet applications to catch fire. They were the buzz of Silicon Valley and the technology industry in general. They received billion dollar acquisition offers that they passed on. Then, due to flaws in their product architecture, their customers started to turn off their application. Overnight, their market collapsed and never returned. 
They were ultimately sold for a relatively tiny amount
So, the judgment that you have to make is a) is this market really much bigger (more than an order of magnitude) than has been exploited to date? b) Are we going to be number 1? If the answer to either a) or b) is no, then you should consider selling. If the answers to both are yes, then selling would literally mean selling yourself and your employees short
Unfortunately, these questions are not as simple to answer as I’ve made them out to be. In order to get the answer right, you also have to answer the question: “what is the market really and who are the competitors going to be?” Was Google in the search market or the portal market? Clearly, in retrospect, they were in the search market. Most people thought they were in the portal market at the time. Yahoo was a tough competitor in the portal market, but not so much in the search market. If Google had really been in the portal market, then selling might have been a good idea. Pointcast thought that their market was much larger than it turned out to be. Interestingly, Pointcast’s own product execution (or lack thereof) caused their market to shrink
Let’s look at the case of 
Opsware
. Why did I sell Opsware? Another good question is why didn’t I sell Opsware until I did?
At Opsware, we started in the Server Automation market. When we received our first inquiries/offers for the Server Automation company, we had less than 50 customers. I believed that there were at least 10,000 target customers and that we had a decent shot at being number 1. In addition, although I knew the market would be redefined, I thought that we could expand to networks and storage (Data Center Automation) faster than the competition and win that market as well. Therefore, assuming 30% market share, somebody would have had to pay 60X what we were worth in forward credit to buy out our potential. You won’t be surprised to find that nobody was willing to pay that
Once we grew to several hundred customers and expanded into Data Center Automation, we were still number 1 and were more valuable stand-alone than any of the prior acquisition offers. At that point both Opsware and our main competitor Bladelogic had developed into full-fledged companies (world-wide sales forces, built out professional services, etc). This was significant, because it meant that a large company could buy one of us and potentially execute successfully (big enterprise companies can’t generally succeed with small acquisitions, because too much of the important intellectual property is the sales methodology and big companies can’t build that)
At this point, it became clear that BMC was going to buy either Opsware or Bladelogic. As a result, the calculus, or whether Opsware was going to be number 1 in the market, needed to be redefined as follows:
1. We had to be number 1 in the Systems & Network Management market rather than the Data Center Automation market, because like the word processor market, the Data Center Automation market was going to be subsumed by a larger market that contained it
2. In order to be number 1, we had to beat BMC+Bladelogic which was a significantly more difficult opponent than either company stand-alone.
Finally, the market itself was transforming due to an underlying technological shift: virtualization. Virtualization meant that the entire market needed to be re-tooled, so we were embarking on a new R&D race to build the best management for virtualized environments. This meant deferring earnings for a very long time.
Based on all of these factors, it made sense for us to at least consider the possibility of acquisition and run a short process to understand the interest in the M&A market. Through that process, 11 companies made acquisition offers of some form. This told me that we were at a local maxima in terms of the market price for Opsware. I.e., the set of potential buyers was convinced that the market was very important and there was no extra premium that we could hope to achieve through better awareness. In the end, based on a lot of analysis and soul searching, I determined that the current local maxima was higher than we could expect to achieve in the next 3-5 years and I sold the company to Hewlett Packard for $1.65B. I think and hope that was the right decision.
The Emotional
The funny thing about the emotional part of the decision is that it’s so schizophrenic.
How can you ever sell your company after you’ve personally recruited every employee and sold them on your spectacular vision of a thriving, stand-alone business? How can you ever sell out your dream?
How can you walk away from total financial independence for yourself and every member of your close and distant family? Aren’t you in business to make money? How much money does one person need?
How can you reconcile Dr. Stay-the-Course and Mr. Sell-the-Thing? Clearly they are irreconcilable, but the key is to mute them both.[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, 
, Nas, uh, yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that
, nah, yo, yo
[Verse 1: Nas]
I come from the housin tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, every day is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slippin
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caesar
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanstan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, stop actin like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fightin'
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then
Must it go on? we must stop the killin'
Tell me why we die, we all God's children
[Hook - Amerie, Nas in background]
All this hate can't last forever
 (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together
 (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world
 (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world
[Verse 2: Nas]
Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from 
 to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, "
 you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town"
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must open up his eyes
To the set backs and rise
Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors and creeds, to home it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to guard it with missiles
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearing a million people problems and followed by Secret Service?
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast,
 
I'm a hot light now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hopin I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothin without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
Top 
 world for the kid and unless
Poppin any rapper's head off 
 shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me,
 
so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror
, 
my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now
[Hook]
[Talking]
Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm sayin?
Niggas ain't forget nothin
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is like, whatever you want out of 
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
Even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about
This is what my country is, and my country's a muthafucka

[Verse 1]
Shouldn't Have To Cry For You To Make Me Smile
Hey, Talking Down To Me, I Got Your Child, Over
Shouldn't Have To Beg You, To Hear Me Out, Oh
Shouldn't Need Another Reason, For Me To Shut You Out
But My Heart and My Mind Are In Battle
Chorus:
Loving You Is Like Running, Running On The Line
Is Like I'm Chasing Down The Love, There's No Finish Line Inside
I Just Keep On Running, Running On The Line
Then You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time!
I Keep On Running
Feels Like I'm Running, Running On The Line
I Keep On Running, Yeah
And You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time
[Verse 2]
What's A Little Laughter, Oh, When It Comes With So Much Pain?
Oh, I'll Be Here Forever, If I Wait For You To Change
Oh, Oh, I Don't Know If I Can Do It, Cause I'm Running Low On Fluid
Can't Believe You Brought Me To This, Open My Heart, You Straight Abuse It
What's It Gonna Take For Me To Break Away?
I Really Don' Know, Hey
!
Cause My Heart and My Mind are in Battle
Chorus:
Loving You Is Like Running, Running On The Line
Is Like I'm Chasing Down The Love, There's No Finish Line Inside
I Just Keep On Running, Running On The Line
Then You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time!
I Keep On Running
Feels Like I'm Running, Running On The Line
I Keep On Running, Yeah
And You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time
[Verse 3:Nas]
Nas verse:
Yeah, yeah
You got the color purple on, Running and waving
Saying nothing can keep us from it
Thats my woman, but you might fall in love with the youngster
Hipster, someone taller, bolder, richer, and locked down
Maybe someone of a different ethnic background, terrific
I wish you the white gown
The garter, white veil, rings and roses
Tiara in your hair like a queen
I toast ya, told you
Lately i’m binging on mercedes benzes
Lot of my lady friends is getting older
Looking for somebody to cuff them
Rush into a husband
Don’t even truly love them
At they best friends bridal ceremony
Jealous and they lonely
Cryin', but they’re phony
Yo, Fiona, you know me
We still got time to find real L-O-V-E
Like the lyrics in the real love songs, the oldies
So keep running for me
If you’re out there listening
Sir Nas don’t need a trophy I need a Mrs
Trying to give it that wife and kids business
Not just arm candy
My dream is to have a family
[Fiona] Bridge:
All I ever wanted was a love on top
All I ever needed was a love that's mine
Did you ever really love me or is love so blind
Uh, here I go I'm 'bout to cross the line
Chorus:
Loving You Is Like Running, Running On The Line
Is Like I'm Chasing Down The Love, There's No Finish Line Inside
I Just Keep On Running, Running On The Line
Then You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time!
I Keep On Running
Feels Like I'm Running, Running On The Line
I Keep On Running, Yeah
And You Wonder Why I'm So Damn Tired All The Time

"Watch Out"----8X
[Nas]
There's a man who live the life of danger
To everyone he meets stays as stranger
With every move he makes, another chance he takes
Odds are he won't live to see tomorrow
He's secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name
Secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks how he talks how he lays the plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name
Beware of pretty faces that you find
A pretty face can hide an evil mind
Be careful what you say, or you'll give yourself away
Odds are you won't live to see tomorrow
Agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They gave him a number and took away his name
He's secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name
Yeah, (secret) yeah, (secret) yeah (secret) yeah, (secret)
Secret agent man, amazing man
Check how he walks, how he talks, how he lays his plan
Secret agent man advance his game
They give you a number then take away your name
Swinging in the Riviera one day
Then laying in the Bombay alley the next day
Oh no, who let the wrong word slip
While kissing them persuasive lips
The odds are I won't live to see tomorrow
I'm secret agent man, amazing man
How I walk and talk and lays my plan
Agent man advance the game
They give you a number then take your name
He's the, agent man, amazing man

[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, I knew a few 
pharmacists
, 
fuck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg'
, waterbed seats in his car
All red ferari,
 
Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
Piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, "Nas, roll with us"
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Dawn, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
For a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him "Here keep that"
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
*beat changes*
She said
[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
"Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now"
[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes
, the drove him off the road
Left him there on Biscayne, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a ho has to, maintain with his fake gang
Sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all
Nas: "Di-sci-ple" *scratched by DJ 3X*
Scarlett: "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"
Nas: "Di-sci-ple" *scratched by DJ 3X*
Scarlett: "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"

[Prodigy]
Yo..
Is it ill, do it need to be fixed?
(That shit is real Dunn; and stop talkin like your skills don't kill)
Nah it's just that sometimes I feel like that
I can write more fouler than the last
[Prodigy's "Conscience"]
Yo that shit is cash trust me Dunn;
 
I'll never lead you astray
Take my word niggas wanna hear how you think
It be that shit that you wouldn't expect to win
That stay playin in they decks over and again
Speak your thoughts, put your all in it
Whatever's in your mind, spit it
Place your anger on the page, release tension on the tape
A stress verse, seem to be what they most thirst
Makes fake niggas disperse, they never challenge what works
[Prodigy]
Balancin the weakness, is what I specialize in
Dunn you my nigga cause you keep me hype when I'm writin
Kept me on point in the night when it might go down
Keep me eyes wide in the daytime as well
Kept me focused on what's real and nuttin else
I find it healthy, to conversate with myself
I kick it with my delf (I kept you alive, all these years)
It's that inner voice you shoulda took heed to and shit
Coulda been home instead of bleedin
Maybe next time you'll listen when it speaks
[Prodigy's "Conscience"]
Yo Dunn, I got a story to tell
Remember last week's mission? I told you bring the gun
(Yeah I remember) Nah listen, without me you'd be a memory
I'm the one you could come to for guidance
Bring you home alive when you wildin
Kept you out of harm's way, told you when to spray
Told you when it's time to put it away
And when the cops came, you was safe
[Prodigy]
Without question, I stay aware Dunn I'm listenin
Everytime we speak it's real, I know your intention's
To make sure we both safe and livin, and breathin
You gets all respect from me Dunn, believe it
[Prodigy's "Conscience"]
Yo we got kids to raise and bills to pay
Enemies to lay down when they stand in our way, it's only us
(What about the clique?) Now if you die is they comin?
When you shot do they feel the bullet?
And when you broke can they fix it? Aight then, you keep writin
And let me do the thinkin, I brought us this far without mistaken
[Nas]
Voices in my head from choices that I dreaded choosin
Cautions I shoulda took heed, lost in my weed, steady losin
Thug stripes, badges of honor, forces to succeed
Whores on they knees, fuckin with millionaires, killers and thieves
I fuck until there's no feelin where, I bust and I pee
I lusted cars but I suffered and my scars run deep
I stay to myself, one deep
, 
pray to my God cause he
Say when it's hard get on one knee, and ask Thy for forgiveness
Fuck the cash, the ice, the Ferrari's
With two-twenty on the dash when your life ain't right
See niggas smile up in your face and stick a knife in your back
Snakes shake your hand and got his dick up in your wife back
Why's it like that? It's life black, this is the game
The way I see it both bitches and niggas, is the same
I trust myself, 
I can't fuck myself
When hoes leave and no weed I still know me, just myself
Fear is weakness learn from what experience teaches
Beware of leeches, the vampires, my secret's
Never follow, cause most niggas is straight up cowards
Take care of my body's the temple, my mind is the power

[AZ]
Yeah, back off vacation
Time to send y'all birds on a permanent vacation though
Check my track record, respect is my black Lexus
Expect me to act reckless, I'm rich and I'm ass naked
A mink with half leopard, my drinks and my glass separate
I roll and I'm half breathless, just stroll through my last message
Like...niggas can't be serious
Never that leery shit, shit I'm mysterious
Move mystique on 'em,
 the doses increase on 'em
You ghost if you sleep on 'em
No joke when my peeps storming
Them cars they come in heavy
The God of the Serengeti
I charge with a large machete
And carve your starving belly
Like...you shoulda known I was serious
Still the prettiest, point blank period
[Nas]
Feeding while alligators on swamps, got miles and acres
No comp, whether it's freestyle, or written down on papers
So far, I've been down from maybe, a decade, I'm still the raw-rest
Plus, suede, and 
Ferragamo's
, 
custom made jewelry's on us
Garments fly apartments, 
they bugging say Nastradamus
Just wasn't one of my hardest, sold over a mil regardless
Chill with them hard looks, I spark clips
If you blood, or Muslim, 5 percent God, or crip
[AZ]
Yeah, ok
Guns in the glove compartment
I'm dapper but love the nonsense
The rapping it numbs my conscience
I'm strapped when I come to concerts
Attack with a hundred monsters
They black and they running bonkers
We're back and we've come to conquer
[Nas]
The last of the fucking genre like...
Niggas can't be serious
Still the grittiest, point blank period
Flow tight as a midget's closet
As tight as a prison block is
No sight of po-lice, when we riot
Fighting the system fire
Get quiet, when I'm approaching
Get tires, jump out the roses
Sip Meyer's Rum out in open
I'm smoking that hydro, choking
I'm scoping, my eyes are on you
Don't reach cause I tried to warn you
No street corner Nas won't come to
To bomb you, 4 5's will harm you
Eccentric, I'm live but calm too
Cordial, but crazy cautious
Roll through with some crazy gorgeous
Hoes, bodies like lady horses
Like...a whole stampede serious
Y'all niggas is funny like Eddie Murphy's "Delirious"
Sped up or real slow, never neo-soul
Hip-Hop only rocking with homey, we co-D's
Not Joss Stone, Hives, or Coldplay
If there was an old days, we pioneered it
Anthony Cruz, Nasir Jones shit, very serious

[Nas (Akon)]
Shakedown (Uh-oh-oh); Akon, Nas, here we go New York
(Uh-oh-oh) Here we go world, here we go y'all
(Uh-oh-oh, Cause it's a shakedown, uh-oh-oh)
[Ali Vegas]
The streets'll do whatever just to see me fail
Mama'll do whatever to keep free from jail
So she tellin' me to get my CDL
But papi said he got some things that we could sell
To turn the corner and to see VVS's
He said you liked girls to get beneath their dresses
You gon' need them SS's, VVS's, BBS's
Here go the keys to the Lexus (Uh-oh-oh)
Now I'm the center of attention like Kareem and them
My squad run around the borough like we Prem' and them
My gang with big truck, wifey's we beamin' them
Let's Esco, that tag team from Queens again
This is Shakedown, here go the breakdown
The big boys are back; 'lil niggas get off the playground
I got up with the homey A now
The kid babies 'bout to make the Earth quake now
[Hook: Akon (Nas)]
Uh-oh-oh, we back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down (Lay it down)
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown (Shakedown)
Uh-oh-oh, (New York to H-Town)
We back now (Here we go y'all)
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
(Uh-oh, Nas and Akon, uh-oh, Nas and Akon)
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh, (Here we go)
[Nas]
My man was smart
Robbed the bank, buried the cash
Did ten years, came home and bought him a Jag
Other side of town, stick-up kids ride around
Young niggas not prepared this time around
Walk in the jewelry store yellin', "Get on the floor"
Snatched the sales lady up, hit her with the bulldog
Grabbin' the ice, the heist went fast as the Vice
Had rushed in, bussin', could you imagine this life?
The streets come alive and laugh at your sorrows
Leavin' your soul hollow
That you fill it back up liquor bottles
Black Messiah had the jux, 20 ki's uncooked
Easy to push, some Japanese dealers were crooks
They leave niggas eyes cut out; what it means to us
He seen too much, but we don't give a fuck
Black truck pull up to the door
Infa-green night vision lens we can see through the war
"Get on the floor"
[Hook: Akon]
We back now
A bunch of gangsters strapped so make a way now
When they come wavin' them gats you know the lay down
And give 'em all you got, cause it's a shakedown
Uh-oh-oh
Do I make myself clear, uh-oh-oh

[Hook:]
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants diamonds without the bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em
[Verse 1:]
Yea, they dug me out the soil and the mines of the motherland
Now I'm displaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yea, guess that's how we got here, slave trade and the diamond trade
Every childs afraid when his mother and father get sprayed
Forced in the army, young killer brigade
Get's a new name, then he gets his nose glued
Till his mind can't take what he's going through
Lookin' in the dirt for that ice so blue
Then the royal family the ice go to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half ashamed
As I rap with my platinum chain
When you shop for me you think about the misery?
The same way we made apartheid history
We can do the same way to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine right?
[Hook:]
[Verse 2:]
My VVS glimmers on my chest, 200 thou encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how how people starve to death, when God blessed the land that lacks the harvest
The stones are quality, but their homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks, but she mad at me
Tear drop shape, ugh, perfect clarity
It shocks so many are killed annually
Cause of greed, lust, and pure vanity
Stop talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every holiday season, jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from they homes, mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives
Keep a Jesus Piece to be fly
But there was a time back in the day when they called that shine
[Hook:]
[Outro:]
Incomprehensible singing

[Verse 1]
One 44,
 
two 45's
Three loaded clips,
 
four niggas roll,
 
one nigga drives
500 Benz,
 
six reasons why this kid should die
We shooting every mothafucka outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car
Guns in our hand, at the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, seven shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor then we shot some more
Niggas he was with two niggas hit,
 
one nigga fell
One tried to run, go get him son
Make sure he's done 'fore we bail, I ain't tryna go to jail
Must handle beef, code of the street, load up the heat
If these nigga think they could fuck around
Real niggas do real things by all means
Niggas knowing how we get down, it goes
[Hook]
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what?
(Kill-kill-kill, murder-murder-murder)
[Verse 2]
Driving through roads,
 
Suburban Chevrolet
Six tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringing the bell, where in the hell, could they be at?
I'm about to leave stepping slow, where my truck was at
Who the fuck is that? Could it be
 
a jack
?
Now pull my strap
, 
it's my man and we have the same plan
There them bitches go
, 
Civic '94
Looking funny though, open up the car door, funny smile
Fuck two already, third ass was heavy
"Nas this is Sherry, Sherry this is Nas and his man, ready?"
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes
Ran through them hoes
, 
plenty ice
, 
that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man
, 
heard a blam-blam
Now I'm wondering, "In this scam, do I even stand a chance?"
He killed the hoes, took all they
 
dough
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky coming down the stairs
Now he wanting mine, reaching for my nine
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
My nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering
"Put your gun down, we can skip town"
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain, took his shit, emptied out close range

Verse 1

Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack,
 
peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin' for 
Rambo
, 
the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin' niggas through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggas until you breathless
Everyday he makin' ten arrests
, 
sheeit
My nigga check this,
 
I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
To check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde
 
caesar
Fettucini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan
, they say he 
laced her cheeba
She do be lookin' weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin' loud, peep her style
, 
in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin', like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin'
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
Cause she's a nympho, suckin' dick and coughin' up info
So now it's set up, her and 
the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazin' from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open it your Gi-Glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked
Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she 
Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyein us
 
(Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down, ayo the bitch is saved now
She's living in a snitch grave now
[Hook]
Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God to save the life that the Devil sold
See +It Was Written+ but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggas roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
Tryin' to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot
[Verse 2]
Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin' up creek
To do his two to four
, 
niggas show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord, Sony Handy-Cam on record
Pop a bottle
, 
cause when you come home
 
we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings
 
we fed the fiends
 (gamble in the back) 
Killa
 shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will
, 
used to slang
 
krill
, 
now he own the
 
hill
Couldn't take losin' his cash
, 
and I could feel
Somethin' in the air yeah
, 
Frank returned with Pierre
A 
gun slinger, who niggas hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin' - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin'
They had gats in each others faces
, 
with kids
And grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggas jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin' for that to set off
Runnin' the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin' shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 
40-Cali stainless
, 
Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggas famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin' Jake retaliatin', and Wiz was up the alley waitin'
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin' inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five
[Hook]


A few keys on muting the emotions:
Get paid (a salary)—Most venture capitalists like entrepreneurs that are “all in”, meaning that the entrepreneur has everything invested in the company and will have very little to show for her efforts if the company does not succeed. 
As part of this, they prefer that the founding CEO have a very low salary.
 In general, this is a good idea, because the temptation to walk away when things go poorly is intense and total financial commitment helps one keep his other commitments. However, once the company starts to become a company rather than an idea then it makes sense to pay the CEO at market. More specifically, once the company has a business (as defined above) and becomes an attractive acquisition target, it makes sense to pay the CEO, so that the decision to keep or sell the company isn’t a direct response to the CEO’s personal financial situation as in: “I don’t think that we should sell the company, but I live in an 850 square foot apartment with my husband and two kids and it’s that or divorce.”
Be clear with the company—One question that every start-up CEO gets from her employees is: “are you selling the company?” This is an incredibly difficult question. If she says nothing, the employee will likely interpret this to mean the company is for sale. If she says “at the right price,” the employee will wonder what that price is and may even ask. If the company ever reaches that price, the employee will assume the company will be sold. If she dodges the question with the standard “the company is not for sale,” the employee may feel betrayed if the company is ever sold. More importantly, the CEO may feel like she is betraying the employee and that feeling will influence her decision making process. One way to avoid these traps is to describe the analysis in the prior section: if the company achieves product/market fit in a very large market and has an excellent chance to be number 1, then the company will likely remain independent. If not, it will likely be sold. This is one good method to describe the interests of the investors in a way that’s not at odds with the interests of the employees and is true
Final Thought
When faced with the decision of whether or not to sell your company, there is no easy answer. However, preparing yourself intellectually and emotionally will help

Yoooo!!
Uh, uh-huh, uh
Yo yo yo yo aiyyo
Never will it stop
Handguns with double digit shots

Leave out the club wit a another niggas watch
Body that man and let other niggas watch
Only thing worse than a coward, is a coward with power
Gotta kill him in the shower, our
Beats is knockin, hooks is rare
Earned my spot, nobody ain't put me here
Burnt my block, I had a fiend cookin wit beer
Like the Bobby Womack of crack
Might see me in the burgundy thing, or the black on black
Matter of fact, go get ya chrome
Cause I rather be, broke together than rich alone
Clappin em' down, backin em' down (uh)
Fuck what ever happened before, I'm whats happenin' now
[Hook: Nas (Jada)]

We Bravehearted
, 
I had bitches tryin to posion me
Niggas who kilt loyalty
Set me up, vested up my move accordingly
I ducked icepicks and nightsticks by cops who rookies
Hard to be righteous, and when life can just stop for pussy
Niggas killin over hoes, guns concealed in their clothes
Bodies at funerals, touch them they feel like they froze
Speech, totally calm, holdin dead rappers dome in my palm
Burnin flag, plus its on the qu'ran, its on the bible
Plus america cause that every car thats drivin
Holdin the homeless sign you focus you know its Nas, the
Prince of the globe, leave no prints of the toast
Played with Ouija boards, burned frankencense wit a ghost
I've learned, to do good plus erase the evil
And do what it takes to keep a smile on the face of my people
I was raised by the apes in this dark creepshow, but yo

[Jadakiss]
Yo yo yo yo yo yo
Think bout when I splatter ya mask(yea)

If ya niggas is riders, the drama will last
If ya niggas is snitch, been judgin my ass
They said I'm too famous to run
So when I empty out this clip, I'm changin the gun
The realer the beef, the longer the clip
Murder ya mans, I'm gone in the mist
Caught his girl after dark so we torched the bitch
We ain't care cause the whore wasn't shit
Doll, 
I ain't takin the L or waistin a shell

Fuck if you hard, fuck if you soft, long as you lost
Dick in the dirt, shit in ya drawers
Ill make ya grandmother get on the floor
Tie you up, then beat you to a pulp, say that this is a war
If'n the four, mackin a pump, actin I dump
Throw you out the window then act like you jump

*whisper*
Silent, silent
Murder
[Verse 1]
It's sort of like the conclusion to "Color Purple"
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop versus the block, shorties is schooled quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder,
 
I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
The violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia
The cognac plurger
 
plus the trees
But whose the foul one to make his nose take a freeze
And got enough gold to rock ice in all hype
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white fiends and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress
, 
since I got a problem with the law-writers
I kick some more items just to explore horizons
The palm lady dreamt of this day so I'mma play
The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay
[Hook]
They say the arms of Nicki Barnes would be enough to blast
A lot of rich niggas fell and started pumping gas
Was it the mind of CIA that bumped off Malik Shabazz
Fuck what they teach in class I'mma reach the mass
Strap up, no back up
, it's 
jungle tactics
Livin' practice, 
out of line niggas get smacked backwards
So wear it if the cap fits, 
fold it up money and mad clips
A stack right under my matress
To smoke a nigga like a Hugh Brothers. motion picture
Niggas gettin' open cruise, roping over niggas
April fools they laugh the jokes on the benches
Cease outside my nigga spoke on his sentence
[Hook]
My right handers never play too close to cameras
It's nighttime scanners circle that allow gamblers
Peace-making niggas pep talk
The peace-makin 'niggas walk off the hot avenues with they brew
Time to get this loot countless, 'cuz sun it ain't no youth fountains
Niggas take cash and shoot, bounce and Pakistanians is took hostage
Locked up inside a linen closet known for spending pies up
What's the flavor when your neighbors do jake favours?
Lock them real niggas down and lettin fake players
Roam around the project this lyrical logic I dilute
The weak can object the right composite
We're plottin' all murderous schemes
It seems I'm ghostly called by the essence of Queens
The palm lady dreamt of this day, so I'mma play
The crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay
[Hook]
[Outro]
And Cain killed his brother Abel when God accepted Abel's
Offering and not his
Abel's offering showed that Cain was not giving his best to God
And Cain's jealous anger drove him to murder -
Drove him to murder

[Hook]
[BUSTA]
God I know I've done got away with a lot
I've been keeping account
Figured I'd holla at you for my blessings [?]
Before I kneel down and a choir would sing
A sprinkle holy water on me, Please I need your help with some things
It's mostly complicated lord, I got me sick in the head
I conversate with people who died like I speak with the dead
Laying down with chicks with no feelings, it's like I sleep with the dead
I fed a lot of people poison, now I eat with the dead
Forgive me for the nega-tive
Things I do and things that I said in order
Take it for granted that my words are being recorded
Cheat, lie, deceit, sold drugs and fucked my mistress
Forgive me for the company I kept and murders I witnessed
Thus I never stole a switch and always stayed of my grind
The older folks would try and talk to me and I pay 'em no mind
The old timers, they used to say the devil is coming to get you
Stay on that path, better hope that god is walking it with you
I hope you listening and your hearing my clear
I strive to never say your name in vain
Or ever beg for mercy in fear
Every money option minimal for feeding my fam
Just tryna secure the food, minus the blood on my hands
A couple youngin' follow what we do
The shit is astounding
You can see the wicked in they eye and know the devils' around them
Until it's time, I wait for your arrival
Stick with survival and continue to walk with your blessings
My gun, and my Bible
Hope you forgive me lord
[Hook]
[NAS]
Mossberg on me, up early
Now what's the verdict?
Perspiring, paranoid, peak from curtains
Hearing voices, church lady gave me holy water
Plus some stuff to smear ointments
All over the skin, I hear it over again
Voices blow in the wind
Telling me foes is coming for revenge
Giving me choices, there that voice goes again
No applause, no air time
No need for the floss or "I don't care" rhyme
No studio session needed to air mines
Here lies a dude who did it
I'm a fool at the pulpit
My jewelry dripping
My uzi slipping
I interrupt his eulogy
Excuse me y'all--sipping
Something to soothe me
Talk about my dude, I miss him
Father's a pimp, his mom a Christian
Laying there shivering, what's his religion?
The choir's a liar, songs they singing are repulsive
Preacher man tell it how it was, it went
[Hook]
Rough around the edges
And the edges stick way out

[Nas]
Girl, can I get your name and number?
Can I relieve the pain you're under?
Change into comfort, uh, get inside your brain
You never cry a-gain, as long as we remain
Doing the little things you love (you love)
Even if I'm a dangerous thug
All the names I'm call, but it keeps you excited
To creep through and ride with a live rich Don
Who was raised in the projects, can I just watch you?
Yeah, lemme see you break it down, I gotchu
Any town we pop, boo
I +Get Around+ like Digital Underground and 'Pac do
[Bobby Valentino - Hook]
Slow down, I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around cause that pretty round thing
Looks good to me
Slow down, never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around and bless me with, your beauty, cutie
I saw you walking, down on Melrose
You looked like and angel
Straight out of heaven, girl
I was blown away by, your sexiness
All I have to do is catch up to you
[Hook]
Slow down, I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around cause that pretty round thing
Looks good to me
Slow down, never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around and bless me with, your beauty, cutie
A butterfly tattoo, right above your naval
Your belly button's pierced too, just like I like it girl
Come take a walk with me, you'll be impressed by
The game that I kick to you
It's over and for reeeeeaal
Like a flower fully bloomed in the summertime, you're ready
To be watered by this conversation, you're ready
I'm in awe cause you shine like the sun
Let me be the one to enjoy you
Let's kick it girl
[Hook]
Slow down, I just wanna get to know you
But don't turn around cause that pretty round thing
Looks good to me
Slow down, never seen anything so lovely
Now turn around and bless me with, your beauty, cutie
[Bridge]
Ooooh baby, you know by now that I want you BAD
I'm floating on thin air I can't come DOWN
Cupid, hit me already DAMN
Now, I can't leave till seven digits are in my hand, MY HAND
[Nas]
Are you tired of the same things? Same drama?
Same guys with the same game? Bad karma?
If I take you away from the man that you wit (uh)
I just wanna borrow you, kiss every part of you
Can you be a fresh girl? Nasty
Do anything I'll request, girl? Then prove it
And you need somebody to talk to
About things, it's Prada, if you want to
Told you Nas'll come through, I bet, c'mon
[Hook and ad-libs]

It's sly Fox
, 
cyclops
We locked in an
 
idiot box
The video slots broadcasting
 
Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube
, 
MySpace
When this ignorant shit going to stop?
They monopolizing news, your views
And the channel you choose
Propaganda, visual cancer
The eye in the sky
, 
number 5 on the dial
Secret agenda,
 
frequency antenna
Dr. Mindbender
Remote control so controlling your brain holder
Slave culture
, game's over
What's a fox characteristic?
Slick shit, sensing misinformation
Pimp the station, over-stimulation
Reception, deception
Comcast digital Satan
The Fox has a bushy tale
And Bush tells lies and
 
fox trots
So, I don't know what's real (what's real)
[Hook]
Watch what you're watching
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping
Start thinking outside of the box
And 
unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Big Brother is watching
Watch what you're watching
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
Stop sleeping
Start thinking outside of the box
And unplug from the Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say, Fox Five is watching
[Nas]
The Fear Factor got you all riled up
O'Reilly?
 
Oh really? No rally needed, I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, setting them up
MySpace, pimps, hoes and sluts
Y'all exploit rap culture, then y'all flip on us
And you own the Post, and y'all shit on us
What is their net worth?
They're going to try to censor my next verse
Throw them off the roof neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse
While I'm clicking my mouse
While they kick in my house
They figured us out
Why a nigga go south?
It's either he caught a body
Don't sleep, they're watching
I watch CBS, and I see BS
Trying to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga want to invest in PBS
 (see BS)
[Hook]
[
Nas]
They say I'm all about murder murder and kill kill
But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton?
The back 
door deals on oil fields?
How is Nas the most violent person?
Y'all don't know talent if it hit you
Bringing up my criminal possession charges with a pistol
I use Viacom as my firearm
Then let the living split you, who do you rely upon?
Then shoot shells at Leviath-o-n
I'm dealing with the higher form
Fuck if you care of how I write a poem
Only fox that I loved was the Red one
Only black man that Fox love is in jail or a dead one
Red rum
, political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and
 
ear drum
Murdoch owns Fox
Not A-Team with Baracus
And he hates Barack cause he march with the marches
[Deep voice outro]
I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth
Not the biased truth
Not the liest truth
But the highest truth
I will not be deceived
Nor will I believe in the propaganda
I will not fall for the okie-doke
I am tuned in...
[Nas]
Watch what they watching
Watch what you're watching
Better watch because they're watching
Watch what you're watching
M-m-media, misleading you
Watch what you're watching

See no evil.. fear no evil.. speak no evil.. hear no evil..
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nuttin to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Knah-sayin?
[Verse 1]
Yo, yo yo yo
Carolyn, from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant -- her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Ki's of dope
, 
lovin cats to ski in her throat
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her iced throat, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passin for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shoppin when she not, coppin bricks of that shit
She hoppin on dicks, ridin Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin for jewerly
Her bodyguard screwin me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothin new to me, blowin backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look, with a bow-leg
Yo niggas said, "Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her"
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about, cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never cough once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, 9-6 he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me, to do her dirty work
[Hook]
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'mma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world
Watch what you do.
. ("It's a.. small world..")
[Verse 2]
Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home
From Attica
 
known, for keepin chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe
, 
he's out to get it
Five years plannin to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month, and
 
deaded his P.O
Started robbin niggas til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starvin niggas he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, "Don't knock hard"
Layin with his bitch, niggas is rich, is what he told her
Played the block, holdin' cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossin fast
His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
We let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull
Another thug died, pitchin your soul, into that infinite
Black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast
Snook was one of em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore, got niggas hit up yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her, ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five
He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive
He was live - do niggas even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks - incidents where po-lice died
He stayed in lower Eastside
, peace God (peace God)
He starin at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit em
I'm reachin for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on
At the gas station
, 
bunch of Arabs racin
Out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip
Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
But can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar
[Hook]
[Outro]
I'm going to see you again..
Uh-huh.. I'm going to see you again.. nigga..
Uh-huh.. going to see you again nigga.. yeah

[Intro]
Bis-Mi-Allah A-Rahman A-Rahim
(
To the Gods.. to the Gods.. to the Earths
)
Pass that shit homie
[Hook]
Now tell me what y'all smokin
What kinda heat y'all holdin
Well is your creep move potent?
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
We bi-coastin', keepin our po-ckets bulgin'
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets in the bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggas c'mon
[Verse 1]
Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin' they gums
, do he be clappin' and shootin' guys
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized
What is his race, nation, or creed?
Is he Arabic, black, Latin, Asian they read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
Fuckin' these wild freaks,
 
a harem of hoes
 (God damn)
And my mystique got 'em tearin' my clothes
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
My nigga smoke with one lung
If he cough he might die, passin' me trees
The liquor bottle's almost empty
We about to collide, with the enemy
Only way you die if it's meant to be
You fuckin' with a general
No discussion is the principle we bust and it's the end of you
Now we knockin' on your mama door
Like we came to fix the sink; my kind of war
Death, angels coming for you
Spirit horse runnin' from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin' for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog dog, 
the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggas gon' light it with Nas
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared?
Do it like this niggas right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start
"I shall - stay real stay true stay holdin figures
Never put a bitch over my niggas
I shall never, cooperate with the law
Never snake me I always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death I swear"
I swear that's how we pledge allegiance, to the alliance
Of underworlds killers and thugs, though the science
Of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green, and pass it around, pass it around
[Hook]
[Repeat until fade]
Wanna get high, come smoke with me
Smoke with me, light it up

This one here’s for all the snitches
Gangsta’s keep ya heads up

[Devin the Dude]
I'm kind of familiar...with this game
And man I can feel ya
Some try to get by, I get high
Well fuck it I stay blowed
Got it burnin' not concerned with what they do to they nose
I'm just tryin' to keep mine clean
And out the air and beware
There's big piles of shit all over the ground, see there
Got the pivotal moves, camel walk, pop-lock
Even hop-scotch around turds until ya top notch
Watch out for cop, for what
I ain't afraid of the fuzz
I ain't got nothin' on me but a buzz
Steady tryin' to cop something
From family, friends, and niggas I run with
All about havin' fun, shit
But it's kind of hard to laugh lookin' at a blood bath
Hearin' a loud voice sayin' "Man what happened"
Hellish whispers turn into a noise
When conversations get twisted and the truth gets lost y'all
[Hook]
Some of em' love ya
Some of em' look up to ya
Some ya gotta watch what they tell ya
To quick to say hell yeah
To shit they'll sell ya
To set ya up for failure again
[Xzibit]
Niggas be so transparent, easy to see through
Hit you from the blindside, niggas try to defeat you
But the game is far from over
In fact it's just the first quarter
I feed millions and walk on water
All business never personal
Listen, I'm irreversible
From this life I'm livin'
Fuck facin' life in prison
Now that's a hard decision
Freedom or your respect
Hold a gauge to the back of ya neck
Reflect hard street principles
Damn near invincible
Keep it on the rise like an organized criminal
This is for the niggas with me movin' in silence
California grievance sex, money, 
and
 violence
Self-made, made to order
Tell me blood is thicker than water
Takin' turns stickin' dick to ya daughter
Just another days work to me
Spittin' the truth, the truth gonna set you free
Misery loves company
[Hook]
Some of em' love ya
Some of em' look up to ya
Some ya gotta watch what they tell ya
To quick to say hell yeah
To shit they'll sell ya
To set ya up for failure again
[Nas]
Life is so unpredictable, full of surprises
I could just die from natural causes, bullets, or virus
Cause latex can break quick just fuckin' some fly bitch
And AIDS hit my people hard, not many survive it
Want to be married with children blunted, happy with millions
Laughin' but lately I'm haunted by some of the saddest feelings
That remind me, I could easily end up like Shyne did
Writin' supportin' our focus and practice wisely
They wanna do me like Tyson, Jordan, Oprah, Jackson, and Cosby
Black man attacked on camera, faggot police'll ride free
So what does Nas see
Don't wanna breathe the same air my enemies breathe
Hate when they beside me
But I just keep em' close, money over hoes
Secrets and codes, lead by example
Whenever speakin' on dough
Creep but be careful
In the streets, see niggas'll dare you, taunt you
Go to jail is what they want you to do
But concentrate
[Hook]
Some of em' love ya
Some of em' look up to ya
Some ya gotta watch what they tell ya
To quick to say hell yeah
To shit they'll sell ya
To set ya up for failure again....
To set ya up for failure again

[Hook: Nas ×2]
Some of us have angels (the kingdom, the power)
Some of us have angels (the power, the glory)
Some of us have demons (greed, and lust)
Some of us have demons (lust, temptation)
[Verse 1: Nas]
Now this is you, 
dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin 
G-stacks
, 
do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the jooks at?
These are your niggas, creepin' they be leavin niggas sleep witchu
Loc' style
, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin' on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin lonely homey chickens
All the homies stick em, you think you own em man listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin'
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
Tumbled til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative or positive
[Hook ×2]
[Verse 2: Nas]
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin, "God take me!"
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops seperatin
Spittin image of a gangster the way pop walked
The way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
Niggas around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangster, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit
[Hook ×2]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Now once again this is you, entertainin your desires
Bitches money and guns, aimin and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin your seed
Tryin to eat? You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
By stickin up niggas, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggas
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
When he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the takes motivate my spirit
And now the body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin' real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
And I will til permanently, my eyes are closed
[Hook ×2]

May laughter
For backstabbers
Turn to tears faster
For you I wish no snakes would slither past ya
Ya have ta
Keep your vision clear
Only a coward lives in fear
My surroundings, got only real powerful niggas here
Real friends we have a code of ethics
No question
No feminine tendencies
We not expecting
No gossip
No phony logic
No counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense
For legal defense
If your homey locked up
Who cares who was the last who looked out?
Selfishness
That's a character flaw
No holding out
Yo what happened to the honor?
You're dealing with
Sensitive prima donna drama
Teflon love
For my dudes who solid

[Intro]
QB the whole NYC
We gonna bounce to this
To all my niggas (yeah, yeah)
To all the ladies
[Hook]
Sometimes I wonder
Will a nigga go under because of his hunger
This game is risky
If a nigga slips six deep
Will these niggas really miss me
Dead partners too soon
All these niggas flipping on me
Cause I won't give no loot to them
Sometimes I wonder
Sometimes I...
[Verse 1: Nas]
Top of the world is what I'm aiming at
These niggas is flaming gats at my circle
I catch you, my first reaction is to hurt you
I hit your bird too
, two in your scalp then you out
Your thug crew is out, blood oozing out
Some serving caine
Knowing nothing about this murder game
Its easily told but hard to hear
When niggas finally find out its real
Thats when they heart pumps fear
The real remains the weak will disappear
My words is 20/20, my vocals are crystal clear
911 style sits on your mind like chrome
Lets say your brains is V12, put it in drive let it roam
What color? Might as well make it same as your dome
You need your thoughts together, that means destination is unknown
As we travel on this road, an infinite path, I get into this math
Drop and get intense for this cash
Will I be subject to kill, live my life by a gat
Just when I think I made it out, the street is calling me back
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nature]
I know a lot of fiends by they first name
Living in Queens, a lot of cats getting stuck for they chains
Holding dirty guns, the young owe dirty ones
Running wild, niggas I raise hell above ground
Live in sin, holding rocks, benjamin grin
Figure once I got knocked, it would end
Never that
They try to tell me I don't love my own
The thugs know, they ride my zone
Like the cyclone trademark
For coney isle, yeah you know me now
I'm giving fake hugs, phoney smiles
Stack profits, you know how the niggas on the block get
Try to give you dap to stare at your pockets
Cruise advance nothing new just the rules of the land
You could tell if they wolves or lamb
You could fight a few, there's a few that ran
Or you could feed them and lose your hand
What you wanna do?
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
Blessing be to the ones who left us
Transcend into spiritual essences
In Allah's arms you rest in
To him we pray for my peeps
Floyd, Twin and Taiyeh, Mr. Sunny back in the day
Get the money yam, he use to say not only nice with hands
But streetsmart he was twice a man
I try to understand life's deep plot
I think of Weewop, Shikeisha they both was mad nice on the rocks
They could have went pro but only God knows why not
Like my nigga Bing, let your sneakers not be clean
He'll start snapping on you, making a scene
Kept the lye, a cool nigga warm heart and stayed fly
You still alive, I see you in your sister's face
Are you there pa? Or looking on from a distant place?
My thoroughbreds, Blackhead quiet but real
Expect to see your black jeep fly over the hill
In the spirit of Richie Lou tribute
Remind the world of the crimes that NY pigs do
We miss you, never forget you, Harry and Sonia
Rest in peace to Marty, a 41st side of Vernon soldier
T.J. Black better known as Killer
I can't replace you, but in me Havoc will always have a brother my nigga
My man Will till we meet again
You hold it up there, I'll hold it down here
I hope you hear my prays clear
[Hook x3]

[Kid] Yeahhhhh!
[Nas] Uhh, QB
[Kid] All the people in the place!
It's the one and only Kid Capri
[Nas] Uhh, TM nigga
[Kid] Along with my man Nas Escobar
[Nas] Ill Will
[Kid] We about to take this one all around the world
So y'all feel this one, come on!
Verse One: Nas
My antidote to the dope add drugs in the party
Pistol-whippin your body lyrical oddessey
Y'all ain't smoke real shit less y'all smokin with me
And y'all ain't heard real shit, til you heard it from me
Escobar, I toasted with Frank White
, 
to this new era
Of gangster life, slangin words in the mic
Thanks to the life, I urge y'all to write pain
You a whore to the war, I remain a virgin that's tight
This game I'mma run til it's done, stack my funds
Packin guns, clean each gat, once a month
Hope ya toast carry heavy as the vest on your chest
Hope you squeeze it cause you're only safe from stomach to chest
Everything else, left open, I'm smokin
Next to your balls, police won't even question at all
It's the Esc- to the -bar, connects in ?Piar?
Overlord of rap, U.S. France to Ecuodar
Chorus: Nas
Have you ever met a QB gangsta, who would
Shake your hand and turn ya back he would shank ya?
Niggas want the street you lookin for me
You want the hot shit you must cop the Kid Capri
Ladies dance to it, niggas pound that in your Jeep
Esco' and Kid Capri, with the motherfuckin Soundtrack
To the Street, thugs pop to it, sell rocks to it
Puffin L's poppin Glocks to it
Verse Two: Nas
Me and the streets share the same vein, same pain
The whole game changed, niggas with no brain could make dough
Off of cocaine, Colombian neckties
Democrats to Bill Clinton gotta respect Nas
Customized flow, words stitched into the seams
Tailor made lyrics words fit ya, spit scripture worship
Far from Ali, niggas can't spar with the kid
Regardless of your bid or who you partners with
Spit, cartridges at so-called hard ni-ggaz
You get, sparked and hit, held as hostages
You know how the mobsters is from the heart of the Bridge
We just started gettin dough, yo pardon the kid
I ain't used to havin shit, my youth as bad as it get
Ghetto bound first lesson was to let off rounds
Shots, echo the town, New York, home of
The Harlem mix tape, master as we all know him now
Chorus
Verse Three: Nas
Uhh, what? Kid Capri
Soundtrack to the Street a theme for every hood
Every lockdown facility, get ?oxed? down for grillin me
Write down hostility, iced down with friends of ours
Respect money and power and them honies that swallow
But what's becomin Apollo, nuttin but bigga bank
Fuck you niggas think I ride for?
Same thing niggas die for, so we draw guns
The same time in this war, leave your mind on the floor
Niggas doin thirty to life to survive in this world
Transportin keys that's inside of a door
Openin spots from Little Rock to Baltimore
Smoked out, chillin on the Kid Capri world tour
Chorus
[Kid Capri]
Yeah
Word up, come on
We make it bump one time word up
My man Nas make it bump one time come on
Come on, we make it bump one time word up
The Kid Capri make it bump one time come on
Chorus
[Kid Capri]
And I say party people, it's the Kid Capri
Nas Escobar, Soundtrack to the Streets
Jumpin off, youknowhatI'msayin?
You a part of history, stay tuned, uh!

[Produced by Large Professor]
[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah
[Verse 1]
For niggas up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was them
Instead of, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they was into dope back then
Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin
Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin it
They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars
[Hook]
We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars
[Verse 2]
Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy Bee battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggas was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that
 
Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shan and Scott LaRock in the jams
Why would they fuck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin mother had a motherfucker
I don't think about it niggas talkin there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet
 
or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a pot yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's
 
y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggas roll with any click that's winnin any crew
Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars
[Hook]
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out
[Verse 3]
This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold, we live it
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
Fuck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggas who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in KB Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggas check you
You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you
Next mornin every news channel and front page
Headlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars

[Produced by No I.D.]
[Hook]
[Verse 1]
Peace to the Five Percenters
On-line engine inventors
Shout to them niggas
Family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women
Hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone
Kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse
She fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first
Can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona
I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one
That's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer
Licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son
She got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching
She got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex
So I guess I'mma just stay
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you
Don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you
I might kill you but do I got love for you
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time
Want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love
What a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me
I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer
Pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to stay

Look at the pain in his eyes
You realize that real eyes can realize real lies
That quote was always weird to me for some reason
Maybe it was the fear that those I hold dear will be in some treason
I'm paranoid as hella somebody help me
Doctors diagnose that maybe my brain isn't healthy
That's redundant though cuz we all a little off
Hypochondriac think ill die if I have a little cough
That's an overstatement
 give me credit though I'm patient
I place my faith in something I can't see but feel
He's my doctor too so I remain patient
When things get rough go to my room and start praying for real
What can I do Lord to make them see?
That I'm weak and a rapper but human as can be
No room for me in fake societies
Abolished from parties cuz I'd rather hold on to sobriety
Thanks for trying me but sayin no is too easy
Can't believe y'all fill the void with parties and think its pleasing
Oh well power to you if you can avoid
Attention seeking and making ruckus and noise
Go about life in the same exact manner
And I promise you'll be blessed with your own manor
Maybe not with serfs
 but 
you reap what you sow
To show your kids hard work pays off when you grow
Up
, if you ever mature
You'll see reading is knowledge and there's knowledge galore
The capacity of the mind is unlimited
That's like ordering some food just to not finish it
What a waste there's ppl that'll kill to be in your place
There's ppl In the grave that would want to have your face
Another chance at life
To be a perfectionist strive
For all the goals and achievements
That only you would like
So stay
A little closer to my heart
We could stitch it back if we've grown apart
Fusho you're in another realm that I can't see
I believe you're in heaven cause of Christianity!
So why shed tears over your own eternal goals?
Cause you left a burn mark on all our souls
You left us without warning nothing can you say
If you were still here this is what I'd play!
Driving to school the day of your death
Thugs mansion on, and I'm taking deep breaths
Letting out my tears for some strange reason
Later found out that you had stopped breathin
That you had stopped breathin
I guess you couldn't Stay

[Hook]
Stay chisel like a box of wife beater by Fila
Lou Ferrigno
, Arnold Schwarzenegger type steelo
Stay chisel, check your paper nigga
Bring the bar to your chest, then push it up harder than the rest
Stay chisel, precisely cup, sharp the fuck
You thought this was a game we came to charge you up
So take it to the brain, laid peoples, know how throw them things
Swift on them toes, knockout blows, so stay chisel
[Large Professor]
Ey yo Nas, I was telling them niggas on the ave
The same shit the other day (right)
Kids gotta stay sharp (no doubt) or stay chisel (chisel)
[Nas]
Yo, perform, a chest naked, I'm looking sharp for the peoples
Not in my physical form, strong thoughts, I'm cock-diesel
Brolic with knowledge so flow with me
Intelligence benching, 4004-50, light a dumbell L
Inhale then hear the lunch bell rings, sweating
Working up her appetite, setting
Mental-calistetics got my mind stretching, then I release it
Have my whole frame bulging under diamond pieces
Take the weight of the world on my shoulders, I hold it
So I consume most the pain for 
my niggas I roll wit
Cause see, the streets ain't no 
Gold's Gym
, papi
And if I feel it going down then my niggas'll spot me
Without the mind, the body, weight don't even mean nothing
Let's take 3 brothers and put them in the bing or something
Who's gonna survive? The wise man, the fool or the warrior
Well if all of their minds 
are chisel, then all of them
[Hook]
[Large Professor]
I stay chiseled, like Snoop Dogg, fo' shizzle my nizzle
In them hardcore streets I'm a straight official
Six pack, don motivator, throwing the weight up
Kid tried to front so I showed him straight up
Had his whole click flabbergasted
Way I was cutting 'em up, one kid yelled out "Grab the bastard"
Tried to rush me, luckily I wasn't rusty
Pulled out, served 'em all up like a custy
Couldn't go out, highway with a blow out
Like Frank, I did it my way, nigga, no doubt
Large billionaire and I'm still here
Writing rhymes for the sphere, I do not feel fear
You heard, I'm 
the dude on the porch with the herb
And I tell you right now, kid, soft is a word
That don't describe me, what y'all know that's this lively
Barbecue 2, Nas right here beside me (with Akinyele)

(Chorus)
Stay chisel like a boxer, wife-beater by Fila
Lou Ferrigno Arnold Schwarzenegger type steelo
Stay chisel, check your paper nigga
Bring the bar to your chest, then push it up harder than the rest
Stay chisel, precisely cut, sharp the fuck
You thought this was a game we came to charge you up
So take it to the brain, laid peoples, know how throw them things
Swift on them toes, knockout blow, so stay chisel
[Large Professor]
Ayo Nas?, I was telling them niggas on the ave
The same shit the other day (right)
Kids gotta stay sharp (no doubt) or stay chisel (chisel)
[Nas]
Yo, performing chest naked, I'm looking sharp for the peoples
Not in my physical form, strong thoughts, I'm cock-diesel
Brolic with knowledge so flow with me
Intelligence benching, four thousand & four fifty
Light a Dumbbell L, Inhale then hear the lunch bell ring
Sweating, working up her appetite, setting
Mental calisthenics got my mind stretching, then I release it
Have my whole frame bulging under diamond pieces
Take the weight of the world on my shoulders, I hold it
So I consume most of pain for my niggas that I roll with
Cause see the streets ain't no GOLD'S GYM, papi
And if I feel it going down then my niggas'll spot me
Without the mind the body weight don't even mean nothing
Let's take three brothers and put them in the bing or something
Who's gon' survive the wise man, the fool or the warrior?
Well if all of their minds are chisel, then all of them
(Chorus)
[Nas]
I stayed proper from my head to my feet
I dead the red meat, the best weed
I dated stressful chicks so now I'm stress-free
Cause life's too short for heartache
Let's fucking party, buy trucks and Ferraris
Driving across the globe, why not?
Sick of the same spot, move to the next
It's real niggas everywhere, bigger business plans
Bigger connects, every woman to one man, it's ten to one
Without the feeling of someone
Making you scared to get up and run
It's called escaping, the mental raping
How could the mind grow when you stagnant
Around dude's who're too slow, my brother's trifling
Pushing cars the color of lightning
Read the writing in my skin... it spells GOD'S SON
There always be another coming up
A killer got a mom son, that's why his luck is never running up
She praise for him, his taking over you position love
Doing what you use to do, being who you was
(Chorus)
[Nas]
Reduce fat rap, no calories in my mentality
No sugar no starch, the pull-ups is hard but get money
Breathe out your nose, start with light weights
Wheat bread instead no carbohydrates
Building my stamina, I'mma rep for the hood
Plum less now my stomach stretch from the grub
Good living, good women, them sex is straight stallions
Bow-leg stances, go'head handsome
Knuckle game, it's like Rubin Hurricane
Dance to the music for the brain
Y'all dudes will never see me down
Reading everything, books and body language
Du Bois, Baldwin, and Chavis
Assata, John Hope Franklin, Angela Davis
Keep your chest up, head straight, eyes to the center
In your worst situation, gotta rise you a winner
So if I'm down to my last dime, cowards will never know
Cause yo my shit is solid, remember yo
(Chorus)

[DMX]
Uh..Uh
Now there's two ways we can do this, keep it real or front
I know you got what I need and I got what you want
And the hunt for soulmates is all over for us
We could go away where nobody would know it was us
Leave behind all the fuss, the studios, the pictures
No autographs, just laughs when I'm wit ya
I know what it's like when they know you now
But bark it at the dog baby, and I'll hold you down
[Mary J. Blige]
Time and time and time again
I knew that our love had to end
But now it's gone so very far
That I can make a brand new start
I thought that we were meant to be
Be one big family
But I was weak and loved you still
No matter what you did, I could forgive
1 - All I need is sincerity
All I need is sincerity
Thinking 'bout you all the time
Never seemed to cross my mind
How you could take the time to kill
Everything our love had built
I never knew how you could hide
Every time you told a lie
But now I know why you're so cold
But I don't understand
Now that you set me free
I truly think that we
Could find love separately
I need sincerity
One thing, I'm not as weak
I'll always stand alone
But my mind is not made of stone
So I'll go on
Repeat 1
[Nas]
Chipped tooth don
Nasty, blue ice timbs on
Screw it face, half moon part, my tattoos dark
On a scale of tough criminals, nothing to call me
I'm a rare individual, young and I'm bossy
Guess it come from a rough life, cuffed at night
Letting off hot lead that bust from iron pipes
I'm the type that have to shed blood
Pray to the ghost of dead thugs, dead blocks that spread drugs
Fled from the cops 'till when my first joint dropped
I'm still wit my hood, Hollow Point still in the Glock
But I've been shitted on by these high class hoes
Even these chickens did me wrong, I was just getting on
So I turned cold, giving 'em hard dick and straight to the hole
Like Rod Strickland, it was taking it's toll
I needed someone I could hold in my darkest hours
A strong couple is a blessing and the heart is the power
Give me someone I could trust, not just a hotty to bone
Does she love Escobar, or love Nasir Jones?
Let me know so I could cop her the stones
What's clear to me, it's sincerity
Somebody I could call my own, yeah
Repeat 1
Ad lib until fade

Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are still dreaming
As the sun sets
And the night falls
And them hoes call
[Verse 1: Kanye West]
He pulled up at 6:30 in a 745
As he wavin' "shorty, hi", you know he showin' his bling out
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out
His girl caught feelings, she mad, she threw the ring out
How she found out she dreamt the whole thing out
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out
When you go to sleep what do you think 'bout
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out
Or grab ya roller skates and turn a roller rink out
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle
Meanwhile, she out doing the same thing now
Nightmares from your dream gal make you scream out
[Adlibs over sampled hook]
One two, one two
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true
One two one two
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true
Some people really
Some people really
Some people really are still dreaming
[Verse 2: Nas]
How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich
Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick
So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit
Then he need that head you get and he deserve your bitch
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright
Now ya luck down you feel like bustin' them shells
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
Want niggas to show you, how to come up wit' green
I schemed since I'm 14s, what the fuck was your dream?
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen
With little niggas, little chain, you was doin' ya thing
How high was I?
 
You the thousandth guy
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye
We on a different echelon
, 
coulda got bread together
Now you gets deaded on
[Refrain: Sample of Kanye West and Nas]
[Verse 3: Nas]
She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle
Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure
Bellinis by the glassful
, said she been meaning to ask who
Who in need of cash who, who could blast tools
And I'm eatin' cashews
, knew she was bad news
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual cause I knew her since high school
Grew up with my dudes, like one of my crew
She worked for Fox News
One of her mans that she lent her drop to
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it
Says it's important that it looks like an accident
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it
She was recordin', had a wire, askin' shit
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks
Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards
Still dreamin'
[Refrain: sample + Kanye and Nas]

[Intro]
Ayo Nasty Nas, what up?
~Ain't nothing, a lot of cowards fronting
I hear what you're saying, but yo, this is all love for me, you know?
~No doubt, smoke them cowards, you stillmatic
[Verse]
Ma, I'm sorry who the fuck I am, I can't trust my fans
Out of luck, no constructive plans
My friends stay powdered up, I'm so drunk, can't stand
You said if I would sober up, I'd be a powerful man
Turned out the street life, you prayed I wouldn't
But every church in the world can't save our children
I stayed out late, you heard shots, thought it would be
Your oldest son on the ground dead, but fortunately
Them bullets had some other names on it, the brother was blind
I hit the L, than we yell out, "It wasn't my time!"
I loaded up shells, one by one
, 
you smelled blunts from my room door
Little Nasir was at war
And little did I care what you saw
Crew deep with a few heat
, 
now it's time we settle the score
But in the projects, I vision Muhammad, in linen garments
Preaching Man, Woman, and Child, the living Prophet
And I'm similar, Nasir Bin Olu Dara
 
Visqu Allah
Fist full of dollars in the dice game
, 
God
The Ice King
, 
God, the Black Christ
, 
elegant stance
Clothes fit me like a crime boss
, 
the
 
medicine man
I see the world collapsing, young pregnancies
Young girls are unfastening their Sasoon jeans, no prophylactic
All this fast shit and fly jewelry, now makes my eyes teary
N.Y. City, grab a hold and ride with me
Rip the Freeway, shoot through Memphis with money bags
Stop in Philly, order cheese steaks and eat Beans fast
And bring it back up top, remove the fake king of New York
You show off,
 
I count dough off when you sample my voice
I rule you, before, you used to rap like the Fu-Schnickens
Nas designed your Blueprint, who you kidding?
Is he H to the izz-O, M to the izz-O?
For shizzle you phony,
 
the rapping version of Sisqo
And that's for certain
, 
you clone me, your wack clothes line
I'd rather Sean John,
 
you bore me with your fake coke rhymes
And those times, they never took place, you liar
Un was your first court case, you had no priors
You master fabricated stories of streets and sound slick
Have you surrounded, you and the faggots you down with
While they riding Nas, trying to boost their careers
Corny as Cormega, all you Hip-Hop queers
Since Illmatic it was written, I am Nastradamus
That's the answers to the puzzle I gave you, now here's a promise
My next few albums, instead of projects
They'll be a difficult test inside the cover for the mind's optics
Come in my hood, but bring the guns with you,
 
it's dark
Headed through Brooklyn, Queens, Harlem, Staten, and Bronx
Headed through Compton, Oaktown, South Central, and Watts
New Orleans, Mississippi, Chi-town
, 
every block
I'm trying to have my positive ways, I put my rhymes on page
Did crimes and headline on stage
I signed a contract, so here it is, you have it
Streets disciple, I'm stillmatic
[Female voice sample]
You make me feel so good

[Intro]
Uhh, 
y'know
I still run with that, that blood of a slave, boilin in my veins
It's just hot - until a nigga can't take it no more
Blood of a slave, heart of a King
 - 
turn my voice up
[Verse 1: Nas]
'Ay yo, 
the brother's "Stillmatic"
I crawled up out of that grave, wipin the dirt, cleanin my shirt
They thought I'd make another "Illmatic"
But it's always forward I'm movin
Never backwards stupid here's another classic
C-notes
 is fallin from the sky, 
by now the credits roll
They're starrin Nas, executive poet, produced directed by
The Kid
 slash 
Escobar
; narration describes
The lives of lost tribes in the ghetto tryin to survive
The feature opens with this young black child, fingers scratched
Cigarette burns on the sofa, turnin the TV down
While Mary Jane Girls,
 
45's playin'
, 
soft in the background
Food from C-Town's
, 
mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dopefiends,
 
walkin out the door, all of us poor
I learned the difference between the snitches, the real ones, and who's soft
And the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumping from roofs, shotguns pumping, made it through my youth
Walking very thin lines,
 
ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover
, 
this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walking through the hot desert searching to be free
This is my ending and my new beginning - nostalgia
Alpha and Omega places, it's like a glitch in "The Matrix"
I seen it all, did it all, most of y'all will pop for a minute
Spit a sentence then the game'll get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all didn't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap repo man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggas who real
Professionals, stick-up kids dreamin' for mills
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From Crip to Pirus this is survival
Blood of a slave,
 
heart of a King
Blood of a slave, heart of a King
Uhh, uhh, blood of a slave, heart of a King
Uhh, yeah
Huh, 
Braveheart
, uhh..

[Verse 1: Nas]
Blaze a 50, sit back in the drop top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Brazilian candy, from Miami
Masseuse, wedding ring on, loving Celine Dion
Hate rap, told me where she get cake at
She's a part-time dancer, part time romancer
Tries to be a mother when she gets a chance to
Left her husband alone to raise they son, he's in pampers
Modeled for a year, got her bachelors degree
33, recovering from plastic surgery
Went from 34B to 36 double D
Met her in San Diego at tha Super Bowl party
Had the Henny, sipped it up with Terrell Davis
MVP, we flicked it up from Sports Illustrated
I was silked out, flossing with Stoute, he had the gators
When she walked in, she lit up the room like Las Vegas
Terrell said her man's a fullback for the Raiders
A drunk who'd fuck cheerleaders and wind up in the papers
It's easy to get the pussy, just don't fall in love
Next thing you know I'm hugged up with this bitch in the tub
Palm Springs, Al Capone's Suite washing her feet
Is this love? Somebody's wife fucking a thug
Hitting it raw, tasting it, wilding out of my character
Taping it, Tyra Banks face with Faiths lips
Giving head like she knew me for years
Pillow talk, she let out tears, told me bout her husbands affairs
Millions she would get if his neck got slit
She rolled the equality, then passed the la to me
Told me 'bout her man's life insurance policy
He stays on the golf course, wears Le Coq Sport
Evenings he drinks his wines on his private resort
You can take him there, here go the keys, you can slip in the rear
Chop a nigga up, yo, meet me somewhere
So we can make more money, then you could ever see rapping
Split the cash and move to Venezuela, adapting
P-11's, ACP shells for blasting
Caught him with his spanish maid
He had a lighter with a can of spray, burning her legs
She tied to the bed, sex S&M, sadomasochistic
Sadistic, yoked her from behind, blew him out exsistance
His maid cried "No", lucky she was blindfold
Naked with mad burn marks all on her thighs, yo
Twelve point five million, he kept his funds
In the Lloyd's of London, goes to his wife and his children
Yo, I thought "What if shorty gets scared, electric chair's all I envision
All she'll probably get is psychiatric supervision"
I switched the plan, the maid flied to Switzerland
Fake ID, forged his wife name, catch the next flight
The same night, headed to Spain, nice game
Now we're back to where we meet again
[Verse 2: Nas]
Blaze a 50, sit back in a drop-top Azure Bentley
Of course with me, this chick who'd make Bobby divorce Whitney
Top down, night air blow her hair
Sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare
Fastlane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash
Took a blast out of her coke bag
Snorted it, started screaming "Yo, we almost crashed!"
Earlier I took the coke out, replaced it with crushed up glass
Her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep
Overwhelmed by greed, put to death

[Produced by Tracksmasters]
[Hook]
Street dreams are made of these
Niggas push Beamers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reaching a key
Everybody's looking for something
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggas with big cheese
Who am I to disagree
Everybody's looking for something
[Verse 1]
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware with one change of gear
Nothing on my mind but the
 
dime sack we blazed
With the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
Dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent til proven guilty
I'mma try to get filthy, purchase a club and start up a realty
For real G, I'mma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme then precisely I'll build my cream
The first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter
 
brick
 
this is it
Fresh face,
 
NY plates
 
gotta crooked eye for the Jakes
I want it all,
 
ArmorAll Benz
 
and endless papes
God sake, what a nigga got to do to make a half million
Without the FBI catching feelings
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
From Fat Cat
 
to Pappy, niggas see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holding gats wasn't making me fat,
 
snitches on my back
Living with Moms, getting it on, flushing crack down the toilet
Two sips from being alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from being rich
 
but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the
 
nina
Up in the hotel, smoking on
 
Sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back living sweeter,
 
fresh Caesar
Guess,
 
David Robinson's,
 
Wally moccasins
Bitches blow me while hopping in the 
drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Growing up project-struck,
 
looking for luck, dreaming
Scoping the large niggas beaming, check what I'm seeing
Cars, ghetto stars pushing ill Europeans
G'n,
 
heard about them old timers OD'n
Young early 80's, throwing rocks at the crazy lady
Worshipping every word them rope-rocking niggas gave me
The street raised me up giving a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was living it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts, everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink noddy
Ain't that funny, getting put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, painting the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggas went for theirs, flipping coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressing, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spending never holding out
[Hook x2]

[Nas]
Low profile, rap style, slick as Nu Nile
Give the crew pounds everytime we cover new grounds
Still surviving but there's a few down, back in the essence
I'm asking questions on the phone, with jail adolescents
Quiet confession, the system's applying the pressure
My mind is guessing, is living and dying a lesson?
But not to be obliged with the mirage
Of cars taking you off track
From with the gods focus on hard
Laid up smoking cigars
Motioning maids to bring me toast and eggs
Kosher, 
ice chokers and wolves to smoke
 ya
My wisdom culture lives in ultra madness
Devoted coach bag bitch
Broke the average nigga's hopes to get mad rich
But what's the purpose
Only the Gods can watch the Earth twist
I'm physically trapped down on the surface
With all the crack merchants
Snakes and serpents
Foul jakes the searches
Clowns with four pounds this ain't a circus
[Hook: R. Kelly]
Street dreamer
Oh mercy mercy me
Ain't nothing out there for ya
Situations gettin heavy
Heavy, heavy
Trying to be a gangster
[Nas]
The black clouds over the hood, I'm on the corner with the thugs
Late night under the moon as they assume I'm slanging drugs
Cause I'm hooded up, 
thought a G a night wasn't good enough
Pushed my luck, yo they had a brother put in cuffs
Luckily, made it out of court comfortably
Judge said I need a job ain't nothing coming free
Could've got a one to three
I try to school these shorties under me
But they can't see
From life to death
So know we back to where we never left the ghetto
It's a damn shame, knowing it's a man's game
Shorty thinks it's time to make ya plans change
All that running round trying to chase
What's already here - been there, it's going nowhere
Pops told me knuckle up - no fear
I wish some of these killings
They could be prevented
Whatever happens it was written
Meaning God meant it
But during ya life you put ya heart in it
Even though it seems we being targeted
Let that brother R hit it
[Hook] (extended)
[Nas]
Sort of wild, since a child, hope was all we had
Drip the bust out past
Complaning the mental straining
How many in my crew is into gaining
Subtract the weak links about the chaining
Rise it start raining
Blasphemy using Nas' name in vain
Some claim supreme being yet they lied in his name
I tried to learn the game
And the only thing I found incredible
Everything I tried to learn see, I already knew (that's right)
And it's embedded in my heart now
So I can sit back, count a stack
And play my part now
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes, he wore disguise
Put a gun to me hungry he went on to chastize
That's Nas ain't it, made it rich from entertainment
Fresh Wally's painted, as he told the kid he came with
My first thought was how the game flip
Yo perhaps it was somebody I smacked drunk in a party on yac
Or was I marked for a contract for some foul act
I did a while back or beyond that
You got me laying face flat
Saying my grace black, woke up in a cold sweat
Yo, I hate that
Nightmares, feeling real, 
word to Will
My A-Alike I lost in the battlefield
That's why I hit the mic with mad appeal
Grab ya shield and meet ya maker
Queens niggas die for paper
Deep things, the street dreams will take ya
[Hook] (repeat to the end)

[Pop] (Intro)
Uhh, still out in these motherfuckin projects
Still a nigga ain't never gonna get the fuck up outta here
Niggas just don't understand the story
Chorus: [Pop]
Niggas die for the street glory
Go to trial get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And QB the streets call me
So if you see me slippin' reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory
Go to trial get tried for each story
And each nigga got a story
And QB the streets call me
So if you see me slippin' reach for me
I'm goin' after street glory
[NAS]
Yo
Every time I turn around niggas shot, niggas stabbed
When tonight's pregnant girls struggling to get a cab
Fiends lurkin', D's searchin', pat pockets
Kids put to bed duck they heads from gas poppin'
Queensbridge slingers hoppin' out Benzes
Don status, dope fiends got syringes
Poppin' out their arm scratching
I remember park jams
Gazelles, perfect wave, shell Adidas
Smellin' reefer way before purple haze
Private stock peer nigga with ill walks like Mark Clare
Hats tilted wild niggas lickin' shots in the air
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names have switched
Ain't nothin' changed but the names Nastradamus and Blitz
What project is this? QB, Vernon and 10th
12th street murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me? Nigga's seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done just remember my name
[Pop]
I'm familiar with the dead grass drama black gates and crime
Embryo of the ghetto born face and time
Niggas shatter they dreams while I'm chasing mine
Ghetto fame got a fellow's name draped and shined
How do I describe an atmosphere where streets are polluted?
Where corruptors and new police being recruited
Somehow I make it through the day stayin' secluded
While the blues aim leavin' another slain, executed
Many thought's cause I see the past grimmly
That could've been me, explodes out on 41st and 10th street
Through all the pap grease and street chases
Sudden raids and confrontations leadin' the misdeamenor weed cases
I blew smoke through hallway window
Watched the buddah clouds linger
Pluckin the blunt brokes from my fingers
My eyes flip different shades
Similar to people you meet everyday who be displayin' wicked ways
Seein' nothing but another day
In this six story rat trap
Them gats clap another nigga's blazed
Events in my hood rotate
Like the barrel on the 38 snob in the world of fake love
Before I blaze son, I'm kissing the slugs
Coming at you kisses and hugs
When death calls who's really a thug
The street glory got me deeply in love
Can't shake it, can't take it, can't make it
Got me needin' this drug
(Chorus)

[Refrain]
[Verse 1:Nas]
Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas
Family men, bringing home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt your happy home
Miserable and alone
Kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse
She fuck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first
Can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona
I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a Knight from England
That's what I named my son, Knight
He was born to be one
That's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer
Licked by an angel's tongue
I'm living dangerous son
She got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watching, she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind deciding which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex
So I guess I'mma just stay
[Refrain]
[Verse 2:Nas]
Even though I don't like you
Next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you
Don't fuck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait do I got love for you
I might kill you but do I got love for you
I want you dead under six feet of soil
At the same time
Want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other but it's love
What a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the hearts of a slain enemy
We enemies but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hating is confused admiration
Spotlight on me
I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer
Pushing a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to stay
[Verse 1: J. Cole]
You can drop a “Wet Floor” sign down for the tears
God and my court date, the two things I fear
Man, they tryna give a nigga years
I’m tryna figure if I should even appear
Or should I escape town? Catch a Greyhound
Change my name, right – catch a plane flight
Out the country, let them ma’fuckas hunt me
Come and catch me if you want me
Know they’ll lock me if I stay
But where I’mma run to?
I got a good girl, we got a son too
And all we went through, we ain’t see eye-to-eye
But what you told me way back, you was a ride-or-die
So if they give me one, or if they give me two
Or if a nigga gotta sit down and do a few
Before I go, baby, I gotta know, what would you do?
Would you find someone new or would you stay?
Like the hoes when they lay with me?
Puppy eyes when I go, sayin’ “stay with me”
Aw, girl, you bad as hell and yet I’d love to
But see I got a girl I’m really makin’ love to
Therefore I’m feelin’ a lot more guilty when I rub you
That’s why I skip all of that kissin’ when I fuck you
Flush the condom down the toilet then I skate
I had you, but you can’t have me, I never stay
[Hook]
Stay
[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Ha! Life in a hometown, ‘fore I could take a step
I’m gettin’ grown now
And startin’ to notice that I see the same hoes around
Guess they had to go ‘round, my raps is profound
I got the flows, but yet a nigga ain’t got no sound
Copped a beat machine, I’m cookin’ up my own now
Got my mind on the city where it goes down
See, if I’mma get to where I’m goin’ then I can’t stay
Although I love it here
I’ll be damned if I sit around another year
Dreamin’ dreams, hopin’ somehow that they just appear
The hardest part of leavin’ is to know my mother here
Oh, but I’m comin’ back – oh boy, believe that
Let’s show the little niggas, boy, you can achieve that
Got the city on my shoulders, piggy back
Hello, my name is Cole and I’m here to stay

[Nas]
[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You was born in the eighties, pops drove a Mercedes
Did a bid, coming home to some grown ass kid
Crack baby turn to young thug, description might fit you
Look around it might hit you
No joke, I wanna pistol fight with you
Shit comes around faster than you think
Blood and white chalk makes pink, so what's that make you?
Become a creature of habitat, the average cat
Won't see where it's at, or where it's going
The hood waits for no one
I've been through it from Ewings to Buicks, to body viewings
Car chases to court cases, to fly vacations
From wanting it all, to being the object of your admiration
Imagination is what they lack
It stops niggas from getting stacks
Feeling trapped on the block with loose cracks
Wisdom is vital for the survival of the street's disciple
[Hook]
"From the day you were born" (Olu Daru sample)
"Starring out, a young disciple" (Nas Sample)
"You had that gleam in your eye" (Olu Daru sample)
Disciple of the projects!
"From the day you were born" (Olu Daru sample)
"Street's Disciple" (Nas Sample)
"Disciple of the projects" (Olu Daru sample)
[Nas]
Moonstruck stuck
, 
slow as molasses in my actions
That's compliments of a fast spliff in the night life
In my flight jacket, adrenaline heightened, mimickin Tyson
After watchin him cut up Razor Ruddock
In the gutter, which was once ghetto prophecy is now ghetto scripture
Lookin back at it, blowjobs from pretty crack addicts
Older Gods wantin no static, told some lil' niggas they can have it
Coke baggin and toe-taggin
They took Will, let me describe him, a live one
I think that he was the true +God's Son+ - not Jesus, but fearless
His ear was up on them sounds too, he'd hear somethin
Not to his likin, and say
 'Son they bitin you"
He never got to see my debut
, wild-mannered
But wild with them hammers, niggas frontin couldn't stand it
Took him off the planet, left us in 9-2
With the philosophy of what arms do, a true street's disciple
[Hook]
[Nas]
Plug the mics up, I'm ready to rock, knocking
Reminiscing of measuring pots of Pyrex, cook in the kitchen
Captain Hook to these infants
It's like my folks is still on the benches
Surrounded by villains and henchmen, was a killer convention
1991, son, gold fronts on the facial, gun buck by the naval
Disciple could blaze you, 
we laced it with embalming fluid
Rhyming to music all this time
Fighting 'bout how Kane and Rakim would do it
Seemed impossible to us that we could ever leave
From the block, where the world was forever freezing
Hell if I ever let them shovel me, son, in this cell again
Fuck these devil policemen, plush leathers, I need them
Risking my freedom, burners in bubble coats
Fuck a sermon from the neighborhood pope
He's sexing ho's, old fart, he's busting ones when he stroke
Multi-colored Pelle Pelle's,
 
young stretch mark bellies
Babies born in a cycle, future disciples
[Hook]

Come here, yeah, yeah
(New York, New York)
Hey yo black it's time
(*"yeah, yeah, hey yo black it's time" - continues throughout song*)
[Nas]
If you knew my streets
You would know all everybody talk about is who got beef
Who snitchin, who told police
Who came home, who still gone, who restin in peace
Now they killin over music money, not drugs, rap replaced it
Cause thugs with no brains got no patience
New jacks I pistol whip 'em with the funky rhythm I be kickin
Musician and flatten composition
Of pain
, 
I'm like Saddam Hussein
Still alive lookin at his dead children's burnt remains
I burnt the game
, learnt you lames a new lesson
Your crew's soft man, ya'll need some new weapons
The P's breed Warriorz in skullies and timmies
Around micks
, 
spics
, niggas 
and guineas
For my ghetto kings in deep thought we don't blink
But don't think we wastin our time
It's a New York state of mind
[Hook #1 - Alicia Keys]
New York, New York, New York, New York City, whoa ohh
New York, New York, New York, New York City, gritty
[Alicia Keys]
It's like a jungle out here
So much struggle out here
And my dreams steal my rest
Sleep's still the cousin of death
Always feels like a race against father time
In the Streets of New York
(New York state of mind, New York state of mind)
[Alicia Keys]
All I see is street hoes
And bullet holes in our people
Only crime fills the brain
Feels like I'm going insane
The revolution has to start, don't waste no time
In the Streets of New York
New York state of mind
(New York state of mind)
C'mon
[Hook #2 - Alicia Keys]
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
State of mind (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
State of crime (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
Big dreams (New York City)
New York, New York, New York, New York ohh
Big schemes
[Alicia Keys]
Oh, it's like the game
Just ain't the same
Baby thugs and girls with no shame
Can't get away (get away), epidemic plague
Every hood in every state
Don't have no reasons cause believin's hard to find
[Break - Alicia Keys]
In the streets of New York (New York state of mind) - 4X
(*"New York state of mind" is also repeated in background*)
[Rakim]
I'm from the home of a million legends and trend settin
A lot of footsteps to follow, I've been steppin
Mind stressin tryin to find direction
, crime spreading
Time precious, 
I ain't have rest since 9/11
I live fast, 
hustle like today is my last
I get cash, the struggle's like a day on the Ave
Crack, D and raw, gats squeezin off
Manhattan streets in awe from casualties of war
The eve of the Apocalypse
, evil people in politics
Every block is at risk, the metropolitan metropolis
The opposite of Liza Minelli and Frank Sinatra
Alicia Keys, Nas and Ra the gangsta's opera
So New York City walk with me, talk gritty
It's up to us New York it's our city
Here the man come with the anthem, hands up
It's time the thrill is back New York, let's stand up
[Hook] - w/ ad libs
[Rakim - talking behind Hook]
Oh yeah, crucial Keys
And your God Rakim Allah
New York City, Nasty Nas
A. Keys, yeah, c'mon

Intro

Nas

All I do is stay focused
Looking straight forward at the world and beyond
I feel people pulling me down
I feel some pulling me up
I can't get stuck
I just keep moving forward
I got places to go man
Let's go
[Hook: Damian Marley]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak hearted wither and
Moan
Only the strong will continue
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
[Verse 1: Damian Marley]
Hey, 
the victory's found in truth
Like innocence found in youth
Self defeat is your own dispute
And man, you put yourself in your own shoes
Either you're winning or losing
Don't you get it confused
Play a star and you know your own movie
Playing of the role you choose, so
Stand up and fight if you know that you're right
And know you will never fail
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail
And the boat shall forever sail
Hey, there ain't no stopping or cruising
Even when you're battered and bruised
Outrun all the sprinters on Mount Olympus
My God's tougher than Zeus
[Hook: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you
[Verse 2: Nas]
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
New York to Cali, for the money, power, respect
It's a journey, some'll get left behind
Cause in life, you cannot press rewind
Get it right, you only have one first chance
To make one first impression that lasts a lifetime
Reputation supersedes itself
Do you believe in Hell? Babylon greed for wealth
Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell?
And disregard those who most need your help
Thick skin, the dark won't take my soul
Survive spiritual wars, see my welts
And the evil's felt, but the faith is stronger
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster
But I clench my fists, ready to go against whoever
Tie my Timbs and rise in the end
[Hook: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and tread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (yeah)
I know you have it in you (yeah, yeah)
I know you have it in you
[Verse 3: Damian Marley]
No man live forever, but never say never
Every good he want better,
 
must be a go getter
And always be clever in every endeavor
Cause drastic time call for drastic measure
Yuh birthright to pleasure From yuh navel string sever
The land and the treasure, work for whatever
Jah said don't be a beggar,
 
the Alpha Omega
Will bless every soul no matter which name you prefer
The immortal stepper, believe in every skin no matter which color they are
We never let we don't know here which kind of weather
You're destined to rise like the Son of Rebecca
Don't stop for a second
Everyone reckon, it sure would be good to be there
Whether Zion or Mecca
When the gates are finally closed
And the saints go marching in
[Hook: Damian Marley (Nas)]
When the armageddon's dark and dread
(I get up and make it happen)
A lot of weak hearted weep and moan
(I get up and we get it cracking)
Only the strong will continue
Do you have it in you?
Come, we've got a journey to go
And when the battle get sour and dread
(I get up and I get it going)
A lot of weak hearted wither and moan
(We get up and we keep it flowing)
Only the strong will continue (only the strong will continue)
I know you have it in you
I know you have it in you
[Verse 4: Nas]
I'm a street lifer
Always harrassed by the cee cyphers
Chief like Geronimo with his peace pipe
I emerged from the street life
This for the homies who relate
Know what it be like
My QB life takin' a turn to the Louis XIII life
Twisted and mangled sort of like Bruce Lee life
Cursed with his son Brandon
If that's you and me, Knight, I pray our fates greater
I speak life I still matter as a rapper, not doubtin'
Even Toni Braxton signed a deal with Craig Kallman
How in, the hell am I supposed stay comfy
When I pay child support, alimony monthly?
Got Maseratis and Ferraris
Only like a woman who's a rider, But only ho's want me
Single life crazy, niggas wives on me
I say stay faithful, they say their man corny
So I'm, stuck with a married woman
So fine, cheatin while they husband
Rushing on the 40-yard line, wonder if
This is what my ex did the whole time
Good niggas seem to always end up
With some hard times, hope not
If a pimp slippin and a ho plot
Ain't nothin to a G in a two-tone drop, kid
And it don't stop, See a nigga dissapearin
With the baddest honeys in the whole spot, yeah

"Your success took a shot at you
What are you going to do now?
How are you gonna kill it?
You're gonna become unsuccessful?
Frank, you can be successful and have enemies uh?
Be unsuccessful too, and even have friends"
[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
I got these niggas breezy, don't worry about it
Let that bitch breathe
I used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress
I guess I blew up quick
Cause friends I grew up with
See me as a Premie but I'm not and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, 
my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with with
Shit, let that bitch breathe
I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion is like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on switch
You're not too bright
, 
goodnight long kiss
Bye bye my reply...
 
BLAH, BLAH
Blast burner then pass burner to Ty-Ty
Finish my breakfast
, why?
I got an 
appetite for destruction and you're a small fry
Now where was I?
Let that bitch breathe
I used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more
Truth be told I had more fun when I was piss poor
I'm pissed off, and is this what success is all about?
A bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths
All this stress, all I got is this big house
Couple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out
All of this Ace of Spades I drink just to piss out
I mean I like the taste could've saved myself 6 thou's
How many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu
Hold up, lemme move my bowels
I'll shit on y'all niggas, OG tell these boys
(Ya'll ain't got shit on my nigga)
I got watches I ain't seen in months
Apartment at the Trump; I only slept in once
Niggas said Hova was over, such dummies
Even If I fell I'll land on a bunch of money
Ya'll ain't got nothing for me
Nas: let that bitch breathe
[Verse 2 - Nas]
Success, McLaren, women staring
My villain appearance
Sacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling
Ghetto Othello
, 
Sugar Hill Romello
Camaro driven
, 
I climax from paper
Then ask why is life worth living?
Is it to hunt for the shit that you want?
To receive's great, but I lust giving
The best jewelers wanna make my things
I make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain
Niggas mentioned on One Love
Came home to the paper in hand
Ain't gotta brag about the Feds young man
Old cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments
Google Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents
Worst enemies wanna be my best friends
Best friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in
But I don't give a fuck walk inside the lions den
Take everybody's chips, about to cash them in
Up your catalog dog, mine's worth too much
Like Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch
Let this bitch breathe
[Jay-Z & Nas]
Let this bitch breathe

[Intro: Busta Rhymes]
Ay fellas
I-I think you might wanna s-s-s-sneak your 
ratchet
 in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put the petroleum jelly on your face
Ayo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets that you knock their ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
Get them!
[Verse One: Nas]
Sitting up drunk, shuffling thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losing focus, what a nigga still hustling for?
My seed is straight, the family's settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin', my life get borin'
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin'
, but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer
, 
leaving behind
Two granddaughters, two grandsons, two nines
Next to me in the 
Phantom,
 who lying?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Dada,
 
trying to stay away from
 
creeps
With their bullshit, trying to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
Where Feds be laying, from a dreadful slaying
Body viewings, at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
With his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dudes is more zealous than Branford
Thinking you're too rich, they want to gun ya
Kidnap ya, cause of they hunger
, 
but you fucking with hunters
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
Camouflaged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggas die over dumb shit
[Hook (x2): Busta Rhymes]
Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma
[Verse Two: Nas]
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitching shit, all up in your body language
Mean mugging your bitch, because she leans over
To look closer
, told you: "Y'all sloppy gangsters", saying:
"Nas is this, and Nas is that"
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foaming at the mouth, losing breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Because the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, four to the stomach
Call more security because, I come off
Anywhere you at, you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back
, 
guns shall rain
A thousand times harder, than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence
, but see
The nigga you feed'll kick it to dude, that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, because jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for Salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say: "That's the way you kill a man
Avoid the shooting",
 hey {*echo* x4}
[Hook (x2): Busta Rhymes]
Fight, fists, dance, sucker
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch your, big, ass, momma
[Outro: Quan, (Busta Rhymes)]
You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waiting on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
Want to come cut my throat, you want to get rid of me
But before I let it happen, them guns going to start clapping
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns going to start clappin
And y'all going to rest in peace, because death is the recipe
(Suicide, bounce, brother) (x4)

Cîroc on splash

summer on smash
Top all gone, got the on summer on smash
Tank top on, summer on smash
My neck got a whole lot of glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y’all know who got the summer on smash
 (WE DO!)
Look at baby girl showing that ass
She let the world know the summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Everybody get the summer on smash
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y’all know who got the summer on smash
[Verse 1: Nas]
Got the summer on smash, eighteen karats
Little overweight, hit the gym
Let’s go get the abs in
Louis belt hangs on the waist it ain’t even fastened
I’m trying to get every number from every woman passing me by
She’s fly; Black, Asian
, 
Boricua
Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern
Eritrean, Ethiopian, 
how you opening
Just rolled four with them bout to smoke again
Rose-gold Rollie
, 
riding the top down
How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht sound
Send a massive e-mail to the females
Tell ‘em where to meet us, give em the details
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
It’s the jam here, check it
It’s the summertime, women damn near naked
It’s single season, they choosing who to mess with
I just smashed another belt for the record
, respect it
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps
My people in the streets
I make it feel like it’s the beach
My goons close by
I’m daring one of y’all to reach
I’m protected like the President
Ain’t gotta give a speech
Got a compass on the wrist
, 
Illmatic on the feets
And they ain’t even out yet,
 
she like Ciroc peach
Chain-smoke cigars
, count a whole lot of cash
And y’all already know who got the summer on smash
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Miguel]
I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only baby
Let me take pictures
Skin, sin
Wait, do you know whose pool you’re in
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill
Your body is a weapon that you can’t conceal
Real make money when the freaks call
Summer on Mars, it’s totally Total Recall
Like, pura vida, she butterfly
Caliente, Mami vente, vente comigo, ayo

Large Professor
This MC has slowly been collecting props on the down low in NYC. 
He added flavor to the Main Source’s “Live At The B.B.Q.”
 
and recently went “Back To The Grill” with MC Serch
. Now, after years as a guest star, Nasty Nas gets the chance to wreck a entire track without havin’ to pass the mic.
     Nas is one of those brothers who can drop freestyles on you without warning. And “Half Time’s” made-for-freestyling track (conservative bass, gritty snare and horn loop) is all Nas needs to catch wreck. His trademark is ill rhymes and punch lines galore. 
“I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships/I used to watch ‘Chip’s’ now I load Glock chips/I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic/Versatile, my style switches like a faggot/But not bisexual/I’m an intellectual/In rap I’m a professional/But that’s no question, yo!”
 
Nasty Nas will definitely be starting trouble in ’93.

[Sample]
The Wiz f/ Nipsey Russell - "What Would I Do If I Could Feel"
"But that's the whole tragic point my friends
What would I do
If I could suddenly feel
And to know once again
That what I feel is real
I could cry... I could smile
I might lay back for awhile
Tell me what, what, what would I do?
If I could feel"
[Verse 1]
I was young, I was surviving the times
Waiting for my moment, I was destined to shine
Little Ray had an NSX, I was hoping I'm next
Wanting bracelets, never had a rope on my neck
Unless I was holding Taiyeh chain--Rest In Peace
Even though that night you flipped on us, you warned us
If you came back and we still on the corners, we goners
Moving on to... move your arm in your watch
To another time on the block
Cause this 40 Side
Where they say Shorty rhyme
Tragedy he used to come through all the time
I'm talking Juice Crew, not what the word define
He had a sister named Erin, for sure was fine
That was my first crush; I bought my first mic
I wrote my first verse, I was about nine
I was about mine, fantasize house buying
Met Paul, he wore some big glasses
Him and Melquan took me where
 
G Rap
 lived
I was happy, just getting some answers
I ain't even know what a record advance was
I'm seeing hoes sex in the studio bathroom
With rap dudes, thinking wow she moved me
Same girl then, right now's a groupie
Back then, she was like the star in the movie
Large jewelry and expensive Gucci
Next stop, 
Paid In Full posse
 recruits me
Knew they were some millionaires, their
 
ropes
 
were dookie
Eric B man looking like touch it, he shoot me
You see, every time Ra didn't show
I get to record demos at attempts to blow
I wonder could they tell, how did they know
Sixteen years later, here I go
[Hook]
[Nipsey Russell]
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?"
 4X
[Verse 2]
I'm with Akinyele in the street, trying to get us a deal
G Rap tried to get us to sign to Cold Chill
But Fly Ty didn't have the contract we wanted
Clark Kent just signed Das, he didn't want us
Russell said I sounded like G, the nigga fronted
Reef and Matty C offered me a little money
Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter
Rebel of Hip-Hop coming through a white rapper
My boy MC Serch
, nevertheless
Took me to Columbia, back then CBS
Chris Schwartz, RuffHouse, he was the best man
Now bugging because the label had just dropped Def Jam
Could you picture Russell needing a check, man
But he smart, he plotted a plan for Polygram
Life is ill, again life's a movie
Then the roster's Cypress Hill, Nas, and Fugees
Before I sold records, no promotion
The rap world like, "What's all this commotion"
Went plat, mad bottles I'm toasting
20/20 hindsight, but how did they know then
[Hook]
[Nipsey Russell]
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 4X
[Verse 3]
Invincible, lyrical, miracle man
... uh
But back to the matter at hand
Cause ten years ago we all strived to be 25
Some cats didn't make it alive
Dated some stars but respect their privacy
Copped mad cars, laying back in the driver's seat
Held myself down, just steering the wheel
Here I am, completed my whole record deal
[Hook: Nipsey Russell]
"What-what, what-what, what would I do?" 4X
[Outro]
"What would I do
If I could reach inside of me
And to know how it feels to say
I like what I see?"

[Verse 1]
It was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like "Fuck
Niggas is buck," mega bloodshed, the tapes red
I heard some bird whisper, "Yo he should have ducked"
I puffed the lilla, just before I hit the scene for rilla
I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
That the street's designed to stop your life
 
clock
The beast'll time ya,
 
cell to cell, suspect ass nigga you fail
First time locked in Comstock
, 
my mind blocks the frail
Bursting blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destinies, fiftys and equities
Queens'll be the death of me
[Hook:]
To the suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight
(Suspect witness don't come outside
You might get your shit pushed back tonight)
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness to witness
My crew dresses, in vest-es, feel the essence
Try to test this, scientist, able and reckless
Slaughter, Nautica'd down, frames look petite
Ten millis
, 
minks designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe
, 
bless the flow lovely
My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rollin two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
Early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Ten Glocks
, 
Armani in small print, upon my glasses
Don assassins, armageddon, the wettin'
Never freakin the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione -- 
are you the type of nigga
To shoot a leg to get your name known?
 
I flip the brain tome
Niggas get hit and wrap the plastic
The mic I strike in vain givin the pain of what a Mack is
What you with? Luchi or drama, no sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets are timin you
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting gem stars
, 
words in my mic type receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin
Rebel to America civilization caught you sleepin

I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
[Verse 1]
I never brag how real I keep it,
 
cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest prestigious,
 
Cuban link flooded Jesus
In a Lex watching Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A Tec squeezing executioner, wintertime I rock a fur
Mega popular center of attraction
Climaxing my bitches, they be laughing
They high from sniffing coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sipping, Sergio Tacchini flipping mad pies
Low price, I blow dice and throw them
45 by my scrotum, manifest the Do or Die slogan
My niggas roll in 
ten M3's
Twenty Gods popping wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip hop's got me on some ol', spraying shots like a drum roll
Blanking out and 
never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I separate,
 
watching crab niggas marinate
I'm all about tecs
 
and good jooks and sex
Israelite books, holding government names from Ness
MC's are crawling out every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum
[Hook]
I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm living like that
For you wack MC's
[Verse 2]
Currency has made us trust in the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind and Fire singing reasons why I'm
Up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill Remy on imaginary graves
Put my hat on my waves
, latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be bugging out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, getting niggas' wakes sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champagne from Sicily
This be the drama, 
I'mma pause like a comma
In a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes high, yellow envelopes of lye
Opening cigars let tobacco fly
Condos are tune-proof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shitting like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang 'em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
Just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
In the basement, chilling on the VI with Mumia
For wearing chrome,
 
I told the judge snakes slither
Like Sharon Stone
 
but like Capone I'm thrown, yo
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Lyrical, ly-lyrical mission, lyrical
Yo the time is wasting, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacing,
 court pen pacing
Individual, 
lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We living in dangerous lives, mad leak
 
and battered wives
A lifestyle on bad streets is patronized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy
 dope fiend named Detroit is still dealing boy
Coke suppliers acting biased
Cause rumors say that nigga's wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani
It's just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo'
, yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
Rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it when you could be about it
My degrees are routed, 
toward the peasy haired brick houses
Instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggas transport thousands
Foreign cash exchange amounting to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peeling off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheeling
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggas with the tecs you blessed word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood
[Hook]
[Outro]
Yea, Capone-n-Noreaga
Yeah yo offical Queensbridge murderers
Mobb Deep keep it real though
Mothafucking AZ yo

[Verse 1]
It was '87
Crack money was "Ghetto Heaven"
Niggas gettin' it
Every block rise to perfection
Green tops, boulders and bottles
Soldiers who follow leaders
You owed 'em dollars
Know that tommorrow you might not see it
Packs got knocked off by sprinklers that never worked
All the way to the monkey bars, cross that line you got murked
That's other niggas territory had fiends in the cheese line
They told them fiends calm down
, 
ten dollars each dime
They never scared of 
Po-Po
, 
was only one patrol car
They wasn't up for crack and I was up on the chin of Pa
Watching hustlers with tinted cars, money makin'
But one kid was into takin'
Had dreadlocks wasn't Jamaican
Fort green he laid
First nigga I ever saw rockin' dreads with a fade
Lead he sprayed on the corners in my hood
Dodgin' and runnin'
The glare in his eyes told you somethin' was commin'
They went to war
, 
Godbless Rita, got shot by mistake
Niggas got knocked by them Jakes
Homicide suit and tie cops
, 
Mayor Koch, screams in rage
Niggas so thugs got pits rocking thick chains
Stick-up niggas so thug they got pits with sick names
Clicks got bigger, extortion cats wasn't hearin' it
But he was regulatin'
A ghetto king, now he levatatin'
They say he smiled in his casket
This ends the first chapter of another Nas classic
[Hook: repeat 2X]
Tales from the hood
, 
trails of blood
But it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should
[Verse 2]
Yeah I'mma help you nigga, cause I see evil's callin' you
Sick thoughts make you wanna take Ki's from other ballin' crews
Top of the world's all he views
A puff of weed, nothing but greed don't live by the rules
Fuckin' wit' me here's what I do
Try to sell your freedom I'm accustomed to
You could ball wit' me or get arrested too
It's easy to land where they dwell with the greasy hands
Twenty to L' what's your plan take your grams
You bought you a Lexus
, BBS 
spendin' Abrahams
Never learned your lesson, choose the right direction
Thin line from life and death and my man checked in
A motel, same one as a young G he know well
Crossed 'em on a coke sell then went on a run
But shorty got his old folks killed, yo he got 'em done
Nobody to run to, what succumb to
My nigga just wanted to eat, now he hunted on the street
[Hook]
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Yeah it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
Though it's all good, try to stay alive like we all should
[Verse 3]
Little Gotti got down for his, let off seven rounds
The kid he hit is heaven bound if he's on the good list
Shorty who shot 'em ran knowing niggas would snitch
Five years passed he ain't been in the hood since
Shot this nigga over a hundred dollars, money, had borrowed
Time passed, on his birthday he couldn't afford a bottle
Least expected to see 'em, then he asked for his
Nigga said he don't got it, so he blast the kid
Escapes the scene, but he couldn't escape the dream
Or how the kid fell when bullets made it too late to scream
Seeing money's face starin' at him
In black space feelin' hands touchin' him
Wake up it got too much for him
Once liked to be alone
Until he started hearin' groans and seein' things
Now it's time to go home
Niggas shocked to see him
Gave him respect what he was missin'
All the way from VA his aunt yell "He hate to listen"
So he popped up, they gave him hugs, showed him love
Then he was reminded of that night when he sprayed all them slugs
He hangin' like nuttin' happened, police grabbed him up
Now he seein' ghosts in the cell, they got him strapped up
Psycho ward, rest of his life injected thorazine
Haunted memories in his mind of the murder scene
[Hook]
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
The book of the dead, translated in thug language, understood?
Tales from the hood, trails of blood
The book of the dead, translated in thug language, you understood

Yo
[Verse 1:]
The trains are New York Veins
The City a cycle
People are the blood stream
Mean and ice cold
Laid back counter clockwise
The dice roll
Yank hats, gang flags, plane crash
Ground Zero, no lost angels
Ain't you from my from my man's and them area?
It's good to meet you
Ya man did 20 years for some FILA sneakers right
True
Had the 560 benz
Light blue
Where ed shot himself in the stomach
Smoke the dust
He let the culture culture bust
Back when we took the D train uptown
Shante and her whole crew, groovy hair style
Yo baby yo baby yo t- shirts
Gold teeth smirks
At mark 125th
Hope the heat work
Few numbers I bagged
Then caught a cab back
To Jamaica Ave by the library
Seen the part of shabazz

New New York New York York York (all to those who live in Queens know just what I"m talking)
New New York New York York York (all to those who live in Brooklyn know just what I'm talking)

Springfield in the work
The 6 borough Jerz
Car jack city
The GW bridge
The Coop City
Popo's hot
Glocks in your Benzy box
Stash and we move fast
Dropped off Miss Pretty
Shakes her A$$ to the building
Knowing I just killed it
Dudes in front of her door blocks her entrance
Asking her "who she been with?"
She laughs "mind ya business"
Tinted windows
Pop dutches with box cutters
Drop brothers off
A crime stock with c locks brothers
Hit town up in New York State
Jakes
Hate a black New York face
Jumping out the phantom with the BAPS
PLANET OF THE APES
With the hammers on her waist
Gorillas in the tristate of

It dont matter if I been out of town cigar lounge
Doing rounds of tequila soon as I touch down
In NYC streets
The heat is on
The Talk
Who said what
I 
catch up on
The New Teflon Don
Who got they death on
Who still stable
Where beef got squash at the round table
Who still holding it
Who hanging with snitches
Couple of Zulu's from back in the days who still up in clinton
No more hand shakes fake arm swing
See if your flinching
Need to hold something thats mention in every ***** sentence
When I get it you got it
D's went up in the project
Bail a couple of homies out
No doubt
Ferrari's in the summer
When its the hummer
Or the turtle top band satellite
Spilling drinks
Hitting potholes with savage types
Club 17 marque
The team flash
Next day hit the spas and the steam bath
Knock out this business
Do some promo
Make paper in the grind capital
Sign a graph then hit the hood
See the folks reminisce on how it was
In the MOST POWERFUL CITY THAT I LOVE, NEW YORK

A teenage thug (you can't tell them shit)
A teenage thug (nigga just chasin his dick)
A teenage thug (he want the world to recognize)
A teenage thug (he's a man now, fuck his size)
A teenage thug (can't stop him, they on the rise)
A teenage thug (the court of law despise)
A teenage thug (wanna fuck and puff lie)
A teenage thug
[Nas]
Dreams of bein a doctor will deteriorate
Takin over the underworld was a clearer fate
Luxury cars, a hundred girls at my face
Laced the name brand, had my game plan mapped out
Lost respect for those cracked out
Most of my elders were failures
To the poison that killed Len Bias from bein Celtic
The later I would hang, the greater my slang
It took my english, replaced it with game
Only cared about, sneakers and two-two bullets
Influenced by the hood, wasn't scared to pull it
Dared to do what I would
First blunt they passed me tasted nasty
Then overwhelmed in the spell the blunt had me
Eyes red, pants saggin
My first dime cut me off for braggin
That we was home alone tappin
Experimentin liquors, doin mixes, feelin sicker
Finish the Henn, throw the bottle, hope it hit ya
[Nas]
Blacked out, I can't see shit sober, not the least bit
Hold your head little man, y'all can't tell me shit
Try to knock the pants off shorty, my hair just cut
My Timbs just bought, the chain I sport I floss
Thugs walkin through the block party, hands on my drawers
Poppin cham' corks, posin like the man of New York
Talk to this hottie with my niggas who quick to blast you
If you old cats, to these niggas, they harass you
[Millenium Thug]
Hey yo cuz, growin up, I almost shattered my plans
Some might say, I'm young at heart, but I'm a grown-ass man
Givin food to my fam, damn, remember the first time
A street thug showed me how to pitch dimes
Only twelve in this hell where kids die
I want bricks off the scale and just slide, and let my shit fly
My Range shift by, I peel the road up
With my shirt up, sweatin, with the ice restin on my chest
Wild as a teenage thug
[Hook]
[Millenium Thug]
Livin and lovin this life, cap peel pump niggas
And since these thugs is trife, give 'em dap for that
Yo where your mack at? I got mine
Twist weed pop wine shift finds, at the end of the night, it's all fine
Livin and lovin, cash stack cousin
Yo' own fam blitz so quick, put clips through whips
Six type shit let you hold it, ice roll with
Twenty below with gat golden, my hand look swollen
Under my glove shit rocky
Unless somebody in my life try to stop me, get popped papi
A breddern, straight to the head that my medicine
No fam of mine do time, we crime settlin
Deliverancy unbelivable, Na'shon tracks smash people
I chill up in the regal Eagle
And plus it clap happy all of them hoes that's born happy
I rip nappy, nature's to cut the roof off of Caddies
You see me?
[Hook w/ variations]

I want to dedicate this song right here
To Jonathan Jackson
 
and George Jackson
Peace to those brothers
I want to shout out my man Sherm the Worm
Eighty years
Come home nigga
Come home, niggers
Ugh
[Verse 1]
I just burnt my American flag
And sent three cracker nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh, I'm loading tips in my mag
To send these redneck biggots to some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag
I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer?
Chorus:
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
Huh? Would you Testify?
You buy my songs
You buy my songs
But will you ride with me?
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
You understand my struggle
That's what you claim right?
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
Then get your aim right
And get your game tight
[Verse 2]
Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Coming to concerts singing ho and shit
Fuck y'all lil' lil' ho bitches
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it
I heard y'all was downloading it (heh)
Like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit (heh)
Like uhh, William Cooper

Chorus:

Uh, Desert Storm, baby

(Thank God I found you)
This for you
[Nas](Mariah & Joe)
Let's show the world you're my golden girl
When we shoppin' they see us on the streets
They say 'Son, scooped a hot one'
You taste like banana cake
You shaped like the number eight
And you my number one candidate
I can't lose you, it's like I'm bettin' in Vegas, crucial
Sweatin', knowin' these players is wantin' you, Boo
I get the chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
(Thank God I found you)
I feel a rush when I kiss you at night, uh
[Joe]
Shorty knows she my baby girl and
Player haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight, oh
Typically a thug wouldn't say this
But you see your love has got me faded
No girl ever made me feel like you do, oh
[Mariah]
Hmm I'mma be here night after night to
Feel your loving arms around me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you make it all right
No one but you baby, can make me feel
The way you make me, make me, make me feel, oh
[Mariah & Joe](Nas)

[Joe & Mariah]
Your touch is wonderful (So wonderful)
Your love is so marvelous
Joy, that's what I feel
When I'm with you, yeah (Yeah)
Nothing, no one (No one, boy)
Could compare to what we have (Oh no, baby)
Love, it feels so good
I'm so glad you're mine, oh
[Mariah & Joe](Nas)
(Make it last, make it last)

(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Thank God I found you
[Nas](Mariah)
What? A thug's dream wife, jeans tight, beautiful skin
Matching brown Timbs, hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap Rudolph Valentino
In beef I become the black Al Pacino
Relax, sweetie, in Benz you could watch the TV
Or lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'mma touch you in the wrong places
Or we could walk through the park
In our bubble north faces, I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you, you my crown jewel
I'm sayin' boo the type I give my last name to
(Make it last)
At Lover's Lane put the top up
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot
Then we finish doing our thing
Fog the windows gettin' very sentimental
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest, word to Will that's my promise
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus
[Mariah & Joe](Nas)
Thank God I found you, thank you, Lord
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, don't you let it end
Make it last, oh baby
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last)
See I was so lost without your love
I was lost without you
(Make it last, make it last)
My every wish and dreams became reality
Thank God I found you
(Make it last, make it last)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
(2000)
Make it last
(Nastradamus)
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
(Mariah, uh, uh Cluemanati, uh to the J-O-E
My baby I'm so thankful
(Thank God for you baby, that's right)
Thank God I found you
(Make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you
(Make it last, make it last)
I was so lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
(Make it last, make it last)
(We make it last, make it last)
My sunshine, my whole life
Make it last forever, baby
(Make it last, make it last)
Thank God I found you

[Verse 1: Nas]
Finished up my new album, single 'bout to be droppin'
Last album on Def Jam and now I got so many options
Maybe I go to Raton, out in a Rollie on arm, couple cigars
They be like aren't you Nas ah man, I just say nah, they say I know you a star
They say I know who you are, but I'm really late night in the stu'
Got a call from my dog Q, for the G-Mix now let's groove
Pussy stock going up, I think it's all of these checks
I think it's cause you love yourself a smooth thug dude from the 'jects
When Belly's on TV the only time that I receive your texts
Shit I must be poppin', got so many options
Tall models, short models, big girls to coke bottles
Church girls to bad bitches, I'm interviewing, holla
[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid (Nas)]
(I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby)
But this song so fuckin' dope, girl, it's harder not for me to blaze it
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I was blazin'
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby
[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
You need a real nigga, shorty so come in, throw that pussy, shorty
See I think you and me can make it, this little verse to get you naked
See, your heart ain't meant for breaking, Cupid's never been mistaken
See, I been caught up in the moment, shit, my type ain't quite her type
But now this gangsta nigga on it, she can twist my weed and hit the 'yac
I can hit your type without the hat, put that pussy on the map
I see qualities in a bad girl, I know that ass you got
Come with attitude and your swag, girl, you ain't wrong, girl
Just when that door knock lose your thong, girl
Cause you girl, cause you girl, girl, cause you girl, girl
[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Throw a loc your pussy, girl, you knowing that your nigga faded
Can I hit that pussy way I wanna while this record playing?
Put my tongue in different places, play a game of Operation
Na-na-na, la-la, la-la, you get what I'm saying
No metaphors, nothing like that
I'm keeping it straight to the point with you
I'mma put this dick up all in-side-of-you
[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]

[Verse 1: Nas]
I pull a string on the lamp and shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparking
Convo weak and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy
Looking at the stars and
I be in the Henny, woozy in the head, wobbling
Gucci pillow on the bed, while she giving noggin
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol and Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining Olive Garden, naw bitch
 Nas is
In the real deal, food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses top-notch watches
Rolexes synonymous shit I'm copping
Ask her has she been around duffle bags full of that fuck you cash
Get off the jet with me in heels
I'll cup your ass
Looking in my eyes
Saying Nas you're one lucky bastard
Grip your clutch, you'll get finger fucked in the passenger
I hit the dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past you
[Verse 2: Nas]
Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrod’s in England
Back to the star spangled
 labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the tundra
Can’t humble the disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks
You must wanna die but
 
you frontin', why?
When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi
I’m a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about
I’m a fuckin juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire
, 
keep a freak I tie up
Who don’t speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet’s a ?, and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami
Time-pieces are from Zurich
It’s like I’m allergic
To Nonoxynol 9
Give it to you raw so you can feel it

[Hook]
I carry the cross,
 
if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross
[Verse 1]
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats, from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS
, 
N.A.S. mean Niggas Against Society
Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me
I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em
To which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit
 it's hard to see 
R&B
Rappers arguably, started fuckin up the game horribly
Cause, I parted the sea
, 
then these novices targetted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin to be
The next me, yeah
 
I support him but he's blinded I see
Jealousy he love me to death and I'm buggin I love him for life
We both still mournin on our mother's, life
And 
I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor
, 
hit yo' ass
With the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come before little Des
I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggas in houses with pretty 
mazes
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggas walk around in they trousers grinnin
Gotta keep a lot of heat
; 
30 cals
 
10 millimeters
40 cals plus the heckler, to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? 
The infrared show you what the tec about
Huh? 
I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy
We can sell mo', boats on the coast
Give, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low
But that ain't reality
, I look happy but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3
Will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil
BITCH! You the reason niggas be beefin, ho get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day
Million dollars ain't, what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggas, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate

[Intro: Super Cat]
He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we

Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don
Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don, Nas the Don
Inna New York City, inna New York City
Inna New York City, inna New York City
[Verse 1]
Smoking a escubano,
 
guzzle my second bottle
Hope I don’t catch a homo,
 
grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me,
 
search but can't find me
Fuck sadness,
 
had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two Tecs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli no shirt on
 
convertible Mazy
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
Just cause y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it
In 97 the six,
 
98 the Bentley
Now it’s the Ghost Phantom
And y'all can't stand em but
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
Army jacket swag
Army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps
Where the gas at
Pass that, not you,
 
you hold cracks in your asscrack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert
 
and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school with Preme team, the Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen
I don’t lean: no codeine, promethazine
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king
Although he’s on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving, same old two-step
Try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr
So I'mma, keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love model chocha Mommy pop it like she 'pose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker, Indonesian doja
Mini me's you can hold up before you end up wet up from my soldiers
Don shit, under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto in the hood
Nas the Don, Super Cat the Don Dada, understood

Pinky rings shining, so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggas that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Counting out stacks and macking out hoes
Pushing big dicks and packing our chrome
We the flyest gangsters
[AZ]
Follow; I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT,
 
it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late
 
Malik Sealy
The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play with me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'mma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And fuck niggas, cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependant, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance
[Hook]
[Nas]
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin
Live how I live it's only cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit it's nuttin to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
Cause 
you are what you eat
, 
you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
To wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin, evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for giving himself to the Lord
Wonderin does Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin
We ain't these little niggas no more, running dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be having they legs shakin, stab 'em, break 'em
I'm 
Hercules Hercules
 when havin relations, the flyest
[Hook]
[Nas] We put this on the, soul of our born
[AZ] 
As we hold the Qu'ran
[Nas] Kamikaze style
[AZ] Older cats coaching us on
[Nas] 
Yo, it's kill or be killed
[AZ] Understand, real'll be real
[Nas] A forty-shot spectrum make your whole embassy kneel
[AZ] Identity sealed, protected by
[Nas] our energy shield
[AZ] 
And fuck a drop, cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
[Nas] Close the books
[AZ] 
Was taught never expose a crook
[Nas] Between the knight and the bishop
[AZ] Wanna knock ya rook;
 I'm a rare breed never had a fair to lead
[Nas] I ain't light niggas recite
[AZ] Too impaired to read
[Nas and AZ] 
We both hard hit just like Camacho and Vargas
, who's the target
[Nas] Now watch how we close the market, motherfuckers
[Hook x2]

[Nas:]
Desert Storm
Firm Biz
Platinum
[DJ Clue:]
That's right... that's right
[Nas:]
What the deal is?
[DJ Clue:]
Clue
[Nature:]
I can take it back to blocks
Or all gods that used to slap box
They after your chain
Q-trains, playin the last stop
But regardless of rain
A mad hot
It neva mattered
Life just pussy and cable, plus they labeled me Savage
For the love of it
Till my death, they stay on sum other shit
Pops shoot, second nut, inherited his stuborness
Skyies are grayer, my whole clique despise the mayor
With dreams to excel, politicing amongst the wisest players
Stay in the cut, forever ganja-ed up
Private affairs
Cause pride in my fairs, News Years to Hanukkah
The streets a death trap
Greet chickens to where I rest at
Chiba-trickin, now it's 3 positions, some even blessed dat
It's only right though
I like em light, thin, and tight... cyco
Bony nails, ponytails, dressed in white gold
Her ass bet my life on the dice roll
You know the steela
Who rightfully, should neva bite the hand that feed ya
[Nas:]
React like what, clean cut
Act up, royal as King Tut
Diamond cut teeth, B what
I know some crews who go through cars like shoes
Some niggas make the news, wild as animals, who saber tools on the A-venues
And V-waves, say shit from my pops stays, the dese days
And PJ's, I concentrate on how the weed strays
Unlike the thoughts of many, unfortunately
A lot of friends will enter pensive force to hit me
Iceberg, eyes burnt
Flights to Pittsburgh with this bird
Got a room sign on the door, not to disturb, we twist herb
Listen to rumors that this bitch heard, some of them absurb
Some made me say 'Word? '
Dozed off, clothes off
Hopin to make moves to the pawn shop and drive slow North
Make it home and get these fo-fos off
Word Up
[Nas: speaking]
Gotta get this shit right, Nature
Need the paper, Desert Storm everywhere
The Firm is everywhere what?
Bring it to the tables like this Major Boy
Bring it to the tables
[Nature:]
Stay on some gat shit, peep The Firm top draft pick
Collapsed on the opposition, soldiers is captured
God explain it, we rollers want this dough and ganja
Visions of holdin toast I post bail join an arraignment
24, still have the same shit, another customer
Posing as a decoy, frontin kinda muscular
I buy & bust, tustle my way up out the iron cuffs
Narcs is jumpin out the sky, knowing I supply the stuff
They fuckin sheisty, identify me by my Nikes
Dice one against the grain, ice chain, nice in a price b
Extortionist, constantly tossed by crooked officers
They swarmed with vultures, caught em hoppin outta carcasses
Niggas is folders, phony potential beads is stolen
Can't even speak right plus keep cracks beneath ya scrotum
Seek advice in the streets light weed rightously on stolen land
Escapin out of state snakes to home a Sam
Foreva roll with fam, no rest it's just my destiny
Effortlessly finesse the recipe
Til my death day forever fresh
Stay frontin pushin G.S. three's
Who checkin me? I called a playa who said this, 'D
Fuck a ref, toe to toe son we hold it down successfully'

'Fore you get hit up, shut up good
We'll merc you in your hood
I'm Al Pacino, Nas the God, you'll lose your life
Whether on the corner or clubs, I'm shooting dice
Break my cipha, I'm get at you
Slice you, knife you, stab you, shank you, splay ya'll
Too many rappers is jealous, who be gassing the fellows
Bunch of actors who never sold a crack in the ghetto
Went from nasty to Esco, back to nasty
Clapping that black heat
None of ya'll are matching my level, I'm the general
[Hook][Nas]

[Fat Joe]
Nowadays I'm on some mack shit
But I used to be loyal to tax, cracks
The nigga that would soil-in your jacks
Feed 'em with trays the size of light bulbs
Coke so bright, it shine like white gold
And the hoes love Joe way before this rap shit
Before the Versace floors and the rolls to match it
Joe's a bastard, I sell pussy for cheap
Make my bitch walk the strip with no shoes on her feet
Don't front for me, you kids is not balling
If you is then why is your wiz on my dick like I'm Jordan
Ties swollen for no man with bold plans
Sick of this rap shit thats why I listen to slow jams
I'm a grown man, the talk of the strip
Niggas think I'm Kev Childs that way I boss this shit
Dogs you's a bitch, I'm here to bring you a muzzle
Saying I'm peeping, I'mma bring you a muzzle
Get the point, General
[Hook][Nas]
Now, niggas salute me, bitches salute me

You should salute me, They should salute me
So fuck who you are, I'm the motherfucking general
[Cassidy]
It's Cassidy, I get rock like a boat when you go fishing
Ayo, Listen I'm the general like Tso's chicken
I'm so sick you can tell by the expression on my face
That I'll get in that ass like preparation H
The weapon the waist and I spray guns off
Cuz if its beef, I'mma be on top of it like A-1 sauce
Pause, now who's the truth (me), Who's quick to shoot (me)
My four-fifth got kick like Bruce Lee
See, I'm a true G, hotter than soup be
Raw like sushi, you gotta salute me
You dudes see, I'll put in an order for you
I'll let the water boil, cook in a quarter in the oil
I had it for sell, but ya'll faggots would tell
Go to jail and start singing like Patti LaBelle
I ain't gonna back in a cell, you rat and you did
Fuck a vest, put a bullet-proof hat on your head
When I'm clapping the lead, I'll murder a nigga
And if he say "he ain't the feds", then I'm serving the nigga
I'm thristy for the change, playing games ain't a issue now
A bitch would give you AIDS nowadays if she kiss you now
I got that coke and that haze on my grillizy now
We going to war, you gonna need more than a pistol now
They throwing missles round, you still trying to get a nine
Uh, its the last days, end of time
The terrorists jacking planes, sending bombs to the Pentegon
They off the hook like intercoms, we just had a bad wintertime
So you know they gonna start to rob
And steal for a mil when its dinnertime
YOu still spending time focusing on dumb shit
On the block smoking, but you broken on some bumshit
What the hell, you might as well put a suit and tie on
Jump into a casket and get your die on

[Produced by Faith N & Nas]
Street's disciple, my raps are trifle
I shoot slugs from my brain just like a rifle
Stampede the stage, I leave the microphone split
Play Mr. Tuffy while I'm on some Pretty Tone shit
Verbal assassin, my architect pleases
When I was 12, I went to...
[Hector]
And you're sitting at home doing this shit
I should be earning a medal for this
Stop fuckin' around and be a man, there ain't nothin' out here for you

[Bridge]
Is it because I got the city on smash now
Oh woe woe
Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now
Hey hey hey hey
[Verse 1]
In the papers you read that Nas is crazy
Lost his mind as he leavin Sony
The INC got him signed
It's only a figment of your imagination
Went to way with New York's Hot radio station
Lost my patience, had to Zone Out
Rappers blown out, I have the throne now
The real shall reign,
 
I feel your pain
You too R&B, follow me, spell my name
[Hook]
[Bridge]
[Verse 2]
God's Son across the belly
Pardon, I'm hardly a bully
But what y'all done to hip hop is scary
Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with
Holdin it down
, 
my proteges are over with now
A producer like Swizz Beats, on fire
So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down
Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children
So bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin
[Hook]

[Intro]
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
{*rewind*}
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
Check, one, two
[Verse 1]
Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggas
Little kids scared cops, wit red dots
Philosophical gangsta, wit violent priors
Goin' back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin' on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, anybody tryin' on, the blocks I'm supplyin' on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em
 and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like 
the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up,
 
but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom,
 hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Malts
Listenin to 
Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writin', semi-automatic no hyphen
It's frightening.... {*scratches*}
[Hook]
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
[Verse 2]
I take summers off, cause I love 
winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhartt
, gun powder stains
Smellin' like trees, sensimille on the brain
Skeemin' on ya girls, bambooze or ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin' off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap, from one of my boys and
, it's
.... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile then, we robbin' 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin'
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night
[Hook]
[Outro]
One, two
Check, one, two {*echoes*}
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do {*echoes*}

[Hook]
I know you think you got it together player, but fuck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch
[Nas]
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggas in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next stop at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress
[Hook]
[Nas]
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, 
that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty fuck while she do
My taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath
[Hook]
[Nas]
Gimme 
Sade
's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ki Toy Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain
 and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words form a pimp was, "Nas, it just don't exist"
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt
[Hook]

[Verse 1]
Fake thug, no love
You get the slug
 
CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch,
 
I got the gauge out
Ninety-six ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A
Verbal AK spray
Dipped attache
Jump out the Range
 
empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze
 
make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes,
 
thirty-two shotguns
Regulate with my Dunns
Seventeen rocks gleam from one ring
Yo, let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of living
Vegas-style roll dice in linen
Antera spinning on Millenniums
Twenty G bets I'm winning 'em
Threats I'm sending em
Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains
A case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique,
 
with the semi-tech who want it
Diamonds I flaunt it, chicken heads flock - I lace em
Fried broiled with basil, taste 'em, crack the legs
Way out of formation it's horizontal how I have em
Fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke Mac it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligan, stay on that piranha-shit
[Refrain]
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
[Verse 2]
I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep
 
sunk in the seat
Tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wilding
Talkin' bout how you ran the Island in '89
Laying up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9,
 
that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him
What was he thinkin' on my corner when it's pay me time?
Dug 'em, you owe me cousin something told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came asking me my name, what the fuck
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep, watching all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun,
 
and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through,
 
blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' L's sipping Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown copping the raw
But a, a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, word up
[Hook]
Y'all know my steelo
There ain't an army that could strike back
[Outro]
Thug niggas
Yo, to them thug niggas getting it on in the world you know
To them niggas that's locked down
Doing they thing surviving yaknowmsaying
To my thorough niggas New York and World wide
Yo to the Queensbridge Militia
'96 shit, The Firm clique
Illmatic nigga
 
It Was Written though
It's been a long time coming
Y'all fake niggas, trying to copy
Better come with the real though
Fake ass niggas yo
They throw us slugs we throwing em back, what
Bring the shit man, live man
Fuck that son
Nine-six shit

Phones ringing off the hook, Bush and Bloomberg callin me constant

It's a new day ya should be scared I'm back with Stoute
Southside, Queensbridge, the hood's in here

What's happenin brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time
[
Jessica Care Moore
]
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like 
hematite
 with the East oils I write
Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsin
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blastin
As the Earth rebels my womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shiftin comb-fistin I predict Goddesses you runnin after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon 
yemanja
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and logged
All paper money is gone
Confused scholars can interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes
We know the young is old
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told

[Intro]
Uh, yeah turn it up, check it out
[Verse 1]
The transition from a young fool
Broke, still on his neck, he hung jewels
Live his life in the ghetto where guns rule
It was cool wasn't mad, I had to take out cabs
Made my first LP
 afforded H-Class, my face gassed
'
94, Sold out in every record store
Local hood rats who wouldn't speak
Now I'm who they're checking for
Shown crazy love, ran up on stage with 80 thugs
After the shows, my niggas robbed the bar and wrecked the clubs
Happy, no hating, 
more henny
, 
more blunts circulating
My single in rotation on every radio station
Eyes popped when I drove my first ride on the block
Summertime, block parties, cookouts, 
I spend my knot
Truly, niggas was fighting over who was closely to me
Happy with the new representative of QB
To hit the top first you have to gotta fall before you make it
With for 4 minutes of your time, watch me demonstrate it
[Hook Slick Rick & Nas]
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)
(Mega popular center of attraction)
I was the main event on the TV for a while
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
(From Nasty to Nas to Nas Escobar)
(Mega popular center of attraction)
I was the main event on the TV for a while
[Verse 2]
Cayman Islands in the winter, summer bus rides to Great Adventure
I've brung New York back to real rap inventors
New crib, diamond rings, killers on my team
Infinitis for my girl for giving birth to 
my queen
3 g's worth of chronic a week
, promoters were mad
I stopped doing shows to spend time in the street
Loot declined, eventually so did my shine
Repo looking for my Lex, back then I wasn't buying
You can guess niggas started saying, with all the success
"Why is your mom still in the projects?" I answered them vexed
Fuck out my face, pistol in my car, full clip
I read about Pablo Escobar and got on some shit
So called mans would plot on my chips, I was fronting
Niggas thought I was rich and got mad cause they was pumpin'
My assumption, niggas want me pumped in the casket
Kept the gun the same three-fifth a nigga got bagged with
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
Caught a case now, I'm home staring off into space
Flashbacks of all the jewelry, cars, crossing my face
Rappers I met, hoes on video cassette
No management, no more good life and no respect
Hearing crowds roar, crystal pouring mixed drinks
Haunted by the thoughts of second album sophomore
 
jinx
Where did I fail? Death threats, woke up in cold sweats
Thinking about all these murders that know where I rest
From hanging with crazy cliques that's known to take shit
Bracelets, and all that beef now I'm involved, was paperless
My cars were auctioned off, now I catch rides with kidnap-niggas
Who snatch babies up to get back figures
Lessons from heaven, every night I slept with my weapon
To guard my family for a minute 
I forgot my profession
Not from Columbia or Nicaragua
Don't distribute coke from Antigua, that shipped out to Panama
Pablo Escobar's bloody reign came to an end
Far from my life; a kid who made his fame from a pen
Hit the studio and change the game again
Wrote down all the pain within, top of the charts, triple platinum
Got the fake love back, money stacks, more plaques
Had to see who I was just to know where I was at
Saw both sides of the game, all the ups and downs
This goes out to the future rap kings coming up now
[Hook]

Nas: "This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are
Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our
Heroes."
[Hook: Nas]
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well"
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, "These are our heroes"
[Verse 1: Nas]
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full
[Hook]
[Verse 2: Nas]
You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black
But your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say 
Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, 
thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley
 , 
Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael
, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni
 poetical black female
Jim Brown
 to the people who sing well from
Fela
 to Miriam Mak
eba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes
[Hook]
Nas: "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know
The crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods . Yeah, ya don't stop. Big up
To Cuba Gooding Jr . Y'know, yeah, y'know. Tay Diggs
What up my nigga. Yeah, ha-ha. And you don't quit
And ya don't quit, and ya don't stop and ya don't quit."
Male Heckler: "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though
Homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
All that paper. Drivin' around like a playboy in
My hood. What type of shit is that?"
*overlapping dialogue*
Nas: "I'm outta here. Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here. I know, I
Got a plane to catch. And I love you back. Ha-Ha
Yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here. A-ha-ha -- PEACE."
Thug Heckler: "Come on nigga, give back to the hood. Cocky
Motherfucker!"

[Verse 1]
United States in fear
London knows I'm a phantom, South Korea knows I'm here
Posted,
 
planted without exception
Rise to your feet for this rarity
Nas and Dilla beat, the fly soliloquy
Some real nigga talkin'
This don't happen too often, take precaution
Liars and frauds got you exhausted
You've been accosted
Who told you I'd lost it?
I just put it down for a second, damn
Can the king lounge for a second, kick his hooves up?
Grow stubble on the face for once without a smooth cut?
Grow a little gut, can't even enjoy the fruit of my labor
Before they call me Luke and hand me my lightsaber
The ruler's back, you can tell by the trumpets
Prince of Wales sent me tea, biscuits, crumpets
Jewelry cost more than the car, car cost 200
Get out your chair, the season of Nasir
[Hook]
(Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da)
The season
(Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da)
This is the season
(Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da)
The season
(Da-da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da)
[Verse 2]
Jay Elec doesn't write it
HOV couldn't write it, he vacationin'
Jungle the only brother I take shit from
Hassan give me lines, we talk all the time
So I guess if he inspired my song it ain't mine
Let me make this clear, they fear the gifted
Some say Shakespeare never existed
Wow, now, look at the amount of resistance
Attempts to chisel my face, from the mountain you guessed it
Bitch you guessed it
There, did I answer your questions?
So, now that's out the way let's get back to my message
Now I'm 40 and a little change
Ride around, sport a new Benz, a little Range
Havin' fun, my little man gettin' big
He and my daughter down, when we talk it's real
Nothin' is watered down, young boy swag
I'm here today as well as the 90's
But the past, like my ass, is behind me
Ignite the pyrex
Try to bite this, get Nasty Nas-itis
Arthritis when you try to write this
Asking why is the Feds at my niggas?
Why the Feds at my niggas?
I know by now I should be talkin' bread, crack, and figures
But not stressin', knot stressin'
I'm survivin', I'm survivin'
It's funny when I catch cops textin' and drivin'
Who questions and penalizes them?
One day we'll have their ass in court and we'll be tryin' them
Hey yo, it's love for Detroit, Mo-Town, Motor City
Dilla lives on, it's like he wrote it with me
The soulful sample complements my rhyme so well
Slacks by Zegna, or YSL
Matchin' the Saint Laurents, I'm fly as hell
Hands in the air, the season of Nasir
[Hook]
[Outro]
Yeah, It's that time, yeah, Dilla rest in peace, what up Detroit?
Fly ladies, dope dealers and killers
Worldwide, NY, yeah, yeah, the season, yeah, this is the season

[Nas]
Third grade, singin Star Spandled Banner
Using proper manners
, 
learned to handle anger
Animal behavior
Later on my block rockin wit my jocks on
Eating Bon Ton cheese popcorn, hummin a KISS rock song
Socks long to my knees
Summer breeze runnin through the leaves
Playin freeze tag
, 
can I stay out, please dad?
Can I hang wit my little gang out?
Hearin shots rang out
, 
heard my moms call my name out
Come upstairs, run up stairs
Take a bath, shit stained underwears
Wipe yourself wit paper
Bad little ass in my bed at 8:30
Wash my plate, ate dinner up late
Gazing at the wall, prayin basketball
Was my future for this young one
Hooping in the sun
, 
proud to be where I come from
Later shootin guns fantasizing
Fascinated by gold rope chains
Looking back at my hood days but things ain't change
[Hook] *all Nas samples* 2x
"Nasty-Nasty-Nasty Nas is a rebel to America"
"Lyrical professor, keep ya under pressure"
"It's like that, you know it's like that"
"Nas-Nas'll catch wreck", "You got the mad fat fluid"
[Nas]
Bumpy Johnson style, old timers, crocodile shoes
Pinky rings, bank robbers wit two's, boss of wild crews
Slacks overlapsed, apple jack hats, quarter field coats
Cadillacs wit white walls and chrome wheel spokes
They was organizing, investing in a piece of the hood
They had drugs, bettin numbers, police understood
They played the Cotton Club, red carpet, hoes on they arm
Plush minks, pimped out gangstas, civil rights wasn't won
E'ry Christmas they was Santa Claus
Nixon was the anti-christ
Bitches ass was bigger than sniffin nose candy white
Listenin to Malcom speak
, talcum powder shaving cream
Layin back, barber chair, straight razor clean
Babies is born, big families started to blossom
Mad people just applied for apartments and got em
Used to be rules to this game of hustlers and dealers
From tommy guns to mac 10's
QB's new born killers (shit is changed)
Chorus 2x
[Nas]
Yo everytime 
I turn around, niggas shot, niggas stabbed
Winter nights, pregnant girls strugglin to get a cab
Fiends lurkin, D's searchin, pat pockets
Kids quick to bed but they heads from gats poppin
Queensbridge slingers hoppin out Benzes, don status
Dope fiends got syringes, poppin out they arms sractchin
I remember park jams
Gazelles, perfect wave shell
Adidas, smellin reefer way before purple haze
Private stock bare, niggas wit ill walks like Mark Clare
Hats tilted, wild niggas lickin shots in the air
Me and Pop was there, through the years our names would switch
Ain't nuttin changed but the names Nastradamus and Blizz
What project is this?
QB, Vernon and Tenth
12th Street, murderous pimps, hot as hell's heat
What could you tell me, nigga's seen it all in this game
When it's all said and done, just remember my name
Chorus 2x

[Produced by Havoc]
[Intro]
Q.B. since 1933
To nine-six
 
nine-six motherfucker
Check the shit
[Havoc]
Nine-six, Escobar 600
[Verse 1: Nas]
Check the shit
My mindset, son got wet
I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex,
 
smacked his bitch silly
Why niggas acting illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt with it
Them niggas sour they put to much flour in their coke
And got the nerve to wonder why they're broke
While we was gleaming, niggas was scheming
Seen the ill Beamers beaming
Triple-beam and doubling cream, had em fiending
To get they fingers on the dosa,
 
I called Sosa
Sosa these niggas hit the God bring the toaster
Meet me in the Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my rat beggin me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches,
 
Venus and Vicious
With two macs inside the Volvo,
 
what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn to bend me over
My nigga Hav gotta soldier
It's getting down, it's going down kid
I heard he might not live, I'm holding back tears
Told these broads to put it in gear
With two females that don't smile digging they style yo
Whattup son, these niggas done started something wild
You know the clique well,
 
Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holding the steel
I paid attention to the females
Maintained bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel
Spray shots and reload and still handle the wheel
Point em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I layed back Escobar status, knowing The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born with
[Hook: Havoc]
Spark the lye,
 
QBC
 
yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
I finesse this, 
Boyardee, we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
Dangerous sons, step back let the tech lift
Lift you up, bless you with a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, QBC yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
We finesse this
, 
Boyardee
, 
we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect with
Dangerous sons, step back let the tech lift
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up
[Verse 2: Nas]
Hold it right there pull over
That nigga right there inside the
 
Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told you
Let's get him now, look at him smile,
 
ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rocking boulders
He's stunting, after he left my man like that
Without a fair chance to fight back, but I'll be right back
He never seen us
, 
Sos' gave the mac to Venus
And Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness
And step to him, shake your ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight parasuco, 
with young faces
Can turn niggas Buttafuco, of all ages
, 
they was amused
By the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York
If they had to,
 
heard him ask Venus
, 
could I have you
He jumped out a Jeep,
 
heard her tell him don't grab boo
They started chatting, was only bout a minute, flat when
They jumped in the back of the Jeep laughing
We followed them pollying, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the 
Mobb
 and them
We layed low about a hour or so these bitches movin too slow
We both holding, what if them wild hoes started folding
Sosa, said say no more, we started rolling
Before we got in they must have shot him,
 
security wildin
There the girls go, hurry up we out in
The 940,
 
me Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggas got murdered in the orgy
[Hook]
[Outro: Woman]
QBC, QueensBridge motherfucker
Roping niggas up
Cause our clique is thick
Another day another dollar
More money, more murder
Fuck this shit, Q.B. up in the house

[Verse 1: Nas]
It's the late night greasy spoon patron
Poolhall making
Big bets, midsection got the 8 in
Dior Christian pimping
Got that penal system diction
Riffing, you don't want it you snitching
Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat
Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black
Bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, 
so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip
From the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't stop me
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed
If I ever say 'Queens get 'em', you know they got me
Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example, or get trampled
Since Hip Hop Is Dead, this is the N
Congratulations in order cause we did it again
[Hook: Nas]
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes
Still getting it and don't even love the doe
Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo'
Stay splifted cause you know that I love the dro
[Verse 2: Nas]
The style is taboo, the chain's offensive
Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukon's and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants (wow)
The Apprentice but not Trump
I'm the nigga with Glocks and pumps
That you don't see much
Sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em
He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don't make me grab your only son
I'm coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape
From phonies who hate
When you rolling with papes
That's why the god party with juicy models
They mob me, the gnarly, Charlie Luciano - hardly
Have to tell y'all, I kill y'all
For spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga
[Hook]
[Outro]
Yo this is Nas, Queens own
Hip Hop Is Dead so put this shit in your vein
Queens Own
Queens Own

[Verse 1: Nas]
How should I start this?
How should I begin, to sin?
Grab the microphone and my rhymes'll win
Wheel of Fortune, spin, around
Check it out, I'm not a rap clown
Get smacked down by the fuckin' four pound
In your dome
Hit you with the nick plate chrome
Queensbridge, thats my motherfuckin' home
Off the top of my head, yo, I'm a blunt head
Police... Police want a nigga dead
But, I'm not going out like that black
I kick the actual facts in so low
Cold as a Polar Bear, I swear,
 
word to Will
But I'mma chill, rhymes'll kill
Niggas know the style when I freak the profile
Asiatic Child, yo
Grand Wizard on the side of me
Yo, Get on the mic and bless the M-I-C
[Interlude: Grand Wizard]
But I'mma pass it off to my man Six-Nine
Kick it one time
[Verse 2: 6'9"]
Hey, Yo, Six-Nine a true to life nigga
Yo, my style is iller, iller than Halle Berry's figure
Niggas don't fuck with the Six-Niner
Shorty watch your mouth, I smack you back in your vagina
Heres to reaper crack and sunrise tequila
Kill the margarita heres a 50 get some more cheaper
The ghetto trooper, so sparred up the booth buddha
My thoughts stay nasty like the underground sewage
To be the man you gotta beat the man
It ain't nothing, so start come here but nothin' mark my timberlands
You want static? Lets have it knuckles will flow like the Atlantic
But sink like the Titanic
Since birth I was thinking too fast, my first beef was with the doctor
When he smacked me on the ass
The trigger man, I'm crazy like Sam
My skills so Ill like a with a white chick with a suntan
[Verse 3: Nas]
One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God, check the prognosis: is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blowing, black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed so
My pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustling brothers who keep the same rank
Pumping for something, some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hanging niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple on streets, trifle on beats
But, Chill! Place the microphone and say peace
So Sudan, take the microphone in your hand
Kick the flim flam
[Verse 4: Sudan]
Qu
e
ensbridge, when will the drama ever cease?
I like to say peace Willie and rest in peace
A cool brother who's all about justice
I still can't understand how he left us
Well... he's gone and life goes on you know
We had a crew but one by one we go
Memories of his face that was full of joy
Rock-a Rock-a bye Rock-a bye
 homeboy
Reminiscing with the brothers standing on the block
Never talk a lot, never was a big shot
It's so hard to say goodbye a sad song
And damn I can't believe my man's gone
Digging back in the days when we used to laugh
Now its a memory that's haunted from the past
Poor Willy its a shame how the ghetto got him
And word is bond - I wanna cry when I think about him
Three bullets to his back on his own block
Not a way to go, killed by the buckshot
Queensbridge wake and up and smell the air
And stop killin' like a villain, like you don't care
Remember Willie and times we had with joy
Rock-a Rock-a bye Rock-a bye homeboy
Rock-a Rock-a bye Rock-a bye homeboy
Rock-a Rock-a bye
[Verse 5: Jungle]
My skills are ill like the prez with a plan
My brothers run from Sudan then the Ku-Klux-Klan
Like a kamikaze, Sadaam Hussein then won
Feel the buns of a nun, put tricks for funds and chill
I slow a verse so you can understand
I kill rappers more freaky than a motherfuckin' a Mic Man
And when it comes to a battle
I stand out tall like the man who played the man on The White Shadow
[Verse 6: Nas]
To my man Jungle
Dwelling in the jungle
Where must we go?
Where must we wander
Deep out the skies come the MC Nas
Not to surprise, but to civilize
Yo, the dumb men wandering around the streets
Listenin' to a nigga rappin' on fly beats
I just kicked a mad philly style
Get bucked wild cause you know my style
I could run a word, kick it to a herb
Make 'em turn into a rich man
Increase the plan, the master plan
Yo, I'm buggin' out cause the weed got me buggin'
Plus the Guinness Stout
Grand Wizard yo, you my physical
Why don't you mic the mic, make the microphone miserable
[Verse 7: Grand Wizard]
It's cuisine, the G the Wiz (?)
You know our culture gone get Biz
I got my man Nasty on the side of me
My man Six-Nine, you know we're not hotter G
I am the man that'll break it down
I'll break all down cuz I got the sound
I got Queensbridge in the back of me
The Tec and everything, I'm coming strapped G
[Verse 8: Nas]
Money and murder, money and murder
The sick shit you heard comin' from my motherfuckin' my  swerve
The words are poetic, I sound energetic
When I'm blunted or Moet'd
My microphone's upsetted cause I'm crazy
Now you know, never lazy
Yo, I'm gonna get all the cash I can
Don't give a fuck if I gotta shoot a policeman
Pluckin' a church and snatch a fuckin'... nah can't be flippin' like that
Cause you niggas try to jock the style
But I left that shit to get the new shit, float like the now
Now you can't catch up G
Cause I got the new styles on the M-I-C
I keep gettin' newer, can't step to her
Nigga from the Bridge, so you keep that shit
And I'mma flip the script next year
And my real name is Nasir
Can't spell it cause I say it too clear
The alphabets are not enough words or letters to use
When it comes to mics I bruise
I just go, with the magical mystic flow
Niggas don't know, that's word to the man Bo
I get Illmatic with the style that's insane
Comin' outta fuckin' murderous brain
Grand Wizard, please take this Mic from me
Before I bug the fuck out and end up D-E-A-D

[Verse 1]
Where we met, I had to give her her respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back
He jumped in the meter cab, just took her cell and told her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, And I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass..how she gone get to the projects?
She ain’t got no cash, and she struggling while walking
So I drive past, "Yo" I say "I ain’t no stalker wit yo big ole ass
Here’s my help I’m tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this? Now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left my ex
, damn we speedin
('Now girl, you mean the world to me' repeats)
I’m a king, you the queen
His and her 6’s and diamond rings
You don’t have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then..
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I’m in, I’m in
[Verse 2]
Baby girl had a son
He was 3, yea I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Naw, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie..that’s cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it’s a setback..
I don’t respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I’m laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you..
But when you make a girl leave a man..
You never really know where she stand..
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you..!

It's yours
Whose world is this?
[Nas]: The world is yours, the world is yours
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine; whose world is this?
[Verse 1]
I sip the Dom P, watching 
 til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation,
 
react like I'm facing
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
[Hook]
[Verse 2]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches,
 
aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-sticking wild golden child
Dwelling in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days we sell it: smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús,
 
soakin' their sins in trays
Of holy water,
 
odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinking a word best describing my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How you living, large -- a broker charge, ca
rds are
 mediocre
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?
[Hook]
[Verse 3]
I'm the young city bandit hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana,
 
stabbing women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes,
 
burning dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop,
 
checkin' dames
Plus the games people play bust the problems of the world today
[Hook]

[Intro]
It's yours
[Verse 1]
I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe

Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
And the Nikes on my feet makes my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me
[Hook x4]
Whose world is this
The world is yours, the world is yours
[Verse 2]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision words of wisdom
Niggas pay me in tuition to listen
The murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plants seeds that bring forth multiple breeds
So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free
Son I need weed to proceed
Change the flow speed
I'm gettin' vexed Giuliani at 666
There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays
I tote the chocolate potent Phillies never wrote roach-sprayed
Shit is a hassle, The Bridge is like a haunted Castle
The mic's my religion the system is the devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is most influential
The colors on mens skin and pens is coincidental
How you livin', large or broker
You wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers
Catchin' court papers gettin' broker
[Hook x4]
[Verse 3]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed

Get your Tick Tock From this hip hop
Any day
[Nas]
5-8 with XXL pants saggin'
Blunts draggin'
But never lived well, imagine
A felon on a two-way street
One way is where blood money coke and homicide leap
The other street opportunity the chance to live sweet
Think positive can knowledge make a cypher complete
So you can be an architect design apartments and shit
Or you can wind up on a jail bus dirty in clip
Soon as I'm on the set I'm never on a chick I play it cool
But still ain't pussy muscles get wet it's just the booze
Check my niggas, what's the gossip, what's the word
Puff some herb
All I see is niggas runnin',ten shots all I heard
Dip behind the car, see somebody on the ground
Ambulance came and got 'em they start calmin' down
Now it's back to the same old shit
You know, the Tarzan and Jane-o shit
In the jungle swingin' on vines
I saw the gat with the same old clip
Another nigga layin' the hit, bloodied up, scream that I'm dying
I be in Queens where the famous hoodrats and ghetto stars are
Pimps do the shuffle at night with slutty bars pah
[Hook]
Prodigy]
{It's like this nigga}
It's on, twirl it up for me, roll that shit big
While I reveal the story of a wild street kid
Cock your seat back, relax, while I spit
The spittin' image of how I live
Well first I was hollyin' for years by them old timer clicks
I was like twelve, they was like, blood, listen
Keep your mouth closed and your eyes and your ears wide open
Gangsta, I soaked it all in
My first ammo was a one shot Deuce Deuce
Had my pockets full of bullets I was real loose
Thug parties out in Wavecrest always got shot up
Thug parties out in Queensbridge always got shot up
No wonder we bugged out it gets so frantic
Niggas ain't wanna fight, we cut yo melon
Drinkin' that Old English
Red bull and blue bull
Mean I draggin' with that cheap shit fuck it we was broke
Little badass, my nigga Rap sat me down, like this
He said: P you gon' wind up dead
You and Hav' real good with that music shit
You need to stick to it, dunn, get your mind of the street
And it stuck in the back of my head
Though I still did my little bit of menacin' every now and then
Bangouts' in broad daylight these things really happen
Niggas get cut up I put it in my rappin'
It's non fiction it's the real deal fish scale
It couldn't get more graphic I'm so treal
I said it's non fiction it's the real deal

fuck around and get your wig pushed back
And big shout out to my man 
Killa
, ???? is on you
L.E.S
. on another murder quest, 
'94 and we out
Keep the lye in the air, 
Hennessy
 everywhere
Keep the la la goin'...

[Verse 1]
Yo, my man was regulatin on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game
, 
drug czars
BM, Jaguars, 
they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin
Drivin they cars, robbin connects
Drivin his Lex, keys was movin
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin
Son was on some real take over the streets shit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?
[Verse 2]
Dudes be, comin from bids thinkin shit is different
Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, 
blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin real loves stories like
Ceaser and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
Cause 
Liz Taylor's hot
, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only
Fuckin with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling cain, crib costin 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him

[Intro]
Shit, tired of gettin shot at
Tired of gettin chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where WE can kick it
A spot where WE belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free and you gotta be a G
... at thug mansion
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my momma's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a family spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places, that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye I see this place, the players go in fast
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion
[Hook: J. Phoenix] + (Nas)
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright (I wanna go)
Nothin but peace (I wanna go) love (I wanna go nigga)
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion
[Verse 2: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more
, 
my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavenly champagne
Where angels soar, with golden wings in thug's mansion
[Hook] w/o Nas
[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquorstore that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion
[Hook]

[Intro: Nas]
I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey
The best journey
Acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out
[Verse 1: Nas]
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets watching many things
Kids walking home from school on drug block
 missionaries
Pass out papers that read: Love God
I see faces, cases, judges, and juries, masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thug's face is my mirror
But this was one in particular
This kid he was the 
vintage stick 'em up pro
16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every morning calls his comrade to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad
Blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where it sets at
Slang from dust to dawn
, 
detectives act like they maniacs
Chasing him, his asthma's flaring
Smoking like a chimney, on remy, of course he not caring
He need a place to go to keep his mind expanding
I give him a helping hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion
[Hook: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy

Uh huh
You know what this is
I'mma let 'em run around one more time
I drop sumpin' on y'all
It's like... it's like
What's it like?
My microphones and Glock nines
Black? I'm dipped in that
The beats, my mash, jam you for the platinum you have
Run it, the illest, watch me become it
I'm here, and took it bowling, like straight to the wig
Speak truth like kids, tell you what you don't know

? Yeah, he's real with the flow
Kick in the do' wavin' the four-four
All you heard was stop, can't take the hits no more
Ha, didn't know I had your block on SWAT?
I'm CIA, y'all nuttin' but beat cops
I rock like my ma's mean, name is cocaine
Place you on my A-fiend list and pay you 'cane
Think you can handle? Not get stripped when you rock?
Think again, you find you lost your mind and judgement
My confidence, springs from watching y'all fall
Aw, forced to hustle, rap in charge
I'mma hop in your brain, tell you whatchu thinkin'
Yes, I am speakin', but I ain't writin'
So cold, I put the ice in nicest

If you say murder that means I'm a Thug Poet
If I say my mind kills that means I'm a Thug Poet
If I say that I'm a flock that means I'm a Thug Poet
And when I lay it down, it makes me a Thug Poet
[Broady Boy]
Thank the dudes for the gangs and tanks of booze
Shanks and twos, 
it's the gangstas, Langston Hughes
My poems' about broken homes and Jesus peaces
Dope is the Popes in Rome
Poetical field, thug overtone, it's like what, yo?
Bring it home, we both go gone
Pre-cord thought flow in the sober zone
My life style, chromosomes frost, hope to clone
The crack lust, black dust, and the gat bust
The claps, the lackluster, memoirs of the black hustler
Condos, Beemers, bomb hoes, 
coke bags,
 
toe tags,
 John Does
Fiends skits them into the plane of day, as plain as day
It's hard to reach, to smell God anyway
Money, think backdrop payin' gray?
Man, rubber-gripped on that rainy day
Peep the way I came to play
One aim at the game, reign and stay
Every stain is straight from objective, insane
'Ey just don't know, I'm two ticks from blowing a hole through music
But I'm more than pimp-whoring him for the street wise
You met the ren
Cuz I open 'neath in the weed, hydrogen
Jam my eyes to skin, guide some of our wisest men
Until the skies of sin
I pray for the day we see you rise again

Aiyyo, everybody know 50 ain't know how to act
I run up on cats with gats and aluminum bats
Y'all got fat while we starved, it's my turn
Shit, I done felt how a slug burned, I still won't learn
Niggas in the 'hood a-tell ya "50 crazy"
I had your moms screamin' "They done shot my baby"
Son, I yap your shine, I clap the nine, I slap you
I'm that one of them niggas you wanna fuck with
I spit the shit that make ya keep listenin'
Keep my wrists glistenin'
I left niggas alone and they still think I'm dissin' 'em
I'm on some new shit, S-Type baby blue shit
Niggas talk behind my back but don't do shit
I ain't looking for love, duke, I'm looking for respect
I leave you with options, like die or hit the deck
I'm a thug poet, you know what I came for, the dough
Clap-clap, y'all niggas get the fuck on the floor, floor

Thug Poet

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Sometimes I get so fucking paranoid
Reminiscing on how them bricks keep going back and forth
I ask the Lord for everything I lack and more
Last thing on my mind was slamming Caddy doors
I just made up my mind, I'm grinding like a boss
Dedicated our lives, sacrifices we lost
Fatal mistakes, 
talking laws of attraction
The paper I'm making, I upgraded my fashion
Everything tailor-made, flossing's my passion
Loyalty came first, number one rule in the faction
Follow my actions, came in in '06
Planted my flag, bitch, I'm taking no shit
I toted them toolies,
 
I bullied the bullies
I made a few hits, 
my bank account Jewish
Niggas is minor, the money manure
I'm thinking like Heinemann, Godfather the 4th
It was never filmed, therefore never seen
It was never him, that's what these haters scream
I wrote the script, I was sipping lean
Now meet the myth, I brought along my triple beam
[Hook: Omarion]
This thing of ours
It's so mafioso
You ain't never know though
Never gon' know so
No never, no never, no never
No, no, no, no
[Verse 2: Wale]
This reefer the sweetest, got me thinking much deeper
They don’t rap for a reason, this is rather convenient
Spend money with my team, make my money from hustle
Women love you for fee, niggas hate you for nothing
Never hate you in public, better let they eyes tell it
Ain't even 5’11″, what the fuck you guys scared of
I’m a loose cannon, screws damaged
And I do think hip hop music needs some newer standards
Hardest working conglomerate, and that's word to my mama
Getting up in they mental, get ‘em outta their garments
Adamantly coming at whoever call up for drama
Just know that DC, Philly, Ohio, Miami got us
Private jet over water, 
natty dread, got no barber
I see Feds, I go that way, that DMV shit taught us
When you young and you black, they see you as a target
So before them Foamposites get ya lawyer in order
[Hook]
[Verse 3: Nas]
The don of all dons, since y'all wanna call me something
All of a sudden, niggas ball and stunting
Y'all just started pulling on Havanas
Pull ya card, ya spineless, where ya heart, I know where mine is
A don is one who accept things he cannot change
Only thing I accept I cannot change is getting old and dying
Gold medallion over my son chest, he’ll hold it down when I sunset
What does death mean to me?
I never owned the concept, I was here
I’m just a spirit, let's get one thing clear
Everything segues into each other
One thing is just an extension of the other
My kid to me, I am my children through history
Upstanding men and stand up women
I am existing
I was conceived to break bread with kings and make connections
We haven’t met yet, my reputation you’ve stuck with
Until we have our formal introduction, that’s enough
But every male is not a man
So some of those that will hold out they hand won't understand
This thing of ours
[Hook]

[Intro]
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
Check, one, two
[Verse 1]
Yo, I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night,
 
tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets, niggas
Little kids scared cops, with red dots
Philosophical gangsta, with violent priors
Going back like black and white TVs with pliers
Leaning on broke down cars with flat tires
Flash iron on anybody trying on the blocks I'm supplying on
Madicon, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em,
 
and the P now got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Martyr, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged with wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listening to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the top of the church steeple
When I'm writing,
 
semi-automatic, no hyphen
It's frightening
[Hook x4]
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move with
[Verse 2]
I take summers off, cause I love winter beef
Started '87, with the shotty in the sheep
Three-quarter length, beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Woolrich, Carhart, gun powder stains
Smelling like trees, sensimille on the brain
Scheming on your girls, bamboos on your chain
Got ill up on the train
Twisting off a cap of a English in my vein
Might've pushed you on the tracks
Deaf crack fiends who can't speak, scream noises
Cause she bought a jum of soap from one of my boys
It's just another day in the hood
And I'm with some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them pile, then we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond,
 
where my man Nino going
And I had to make a song, speaking on my old life
For the thieves who come out at night
[Hook x4]
[Outro]
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do

[Intro:]
(Whose world is this?)
La-la-la-la-la
(Whose world is this?)
[Verse 1:]
I sip the Dom P, watching Gandhi til I'm charged
Writing in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme - play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facing
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracing
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
And the Nikes on my feet keep my cipher complete
Whether cruising in a Six cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it; the beats make me falling asleep
I keep falling, but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (get money!)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (take money!)
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
[Hook:]
(Whose world is this?)
The world is yours
Disciple of the projects slash verbal murderer
(Whose world is this?)
Yea, the world is yours
To the Philly blunt-heads, crack pumping drug murderers
(Whose world is this?)
The world is yours
To my niggas coming home from lockdown with new plans
(Whose world is this?)
Fuck it, the world is mine, holding the stolen cop's Glock with G notes in my hand
[Verse 2:]
To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
My insight enlights vision words of wisdom
Niggas pay me in tuition to listen
The murder paragraphs of mysticism
Man plants seeds that bring forth multiple breeds
So many cultures on one planet but one culture's free
Son I need weed to proceed
Change the flow speed
I'm gettin' vexed Giuliani at 666
There's no days for broke days sellin' smoke pays
I tote the chocolate potent Phillies never wrote roach-sprayed
Shit is a hassle, The Bridge is like a haunted Castle
The mic's my religion the system is the devil's lasso
And yo, the trife life is most influential
The colors on mens skin and pens is coincidental
How you livin', large or broker
You wastin' time extortin' papers from smokers
Catchin' court papers gettin' broker
[Hook 2:]
The world is mine
Persona of late Tony Montana, yea gettin' mine
(Whose world is this?)
The whole world is mine, who wanted?
I never fronted, I'm forever blunted, getting lye
Henne up with the lye, never stop, we don't stop the - henne low, puffin' lye ya'll
Don't stop the henne low, we puff the lye, everyday puffin' lye, plus the henne low
[Verse 3:]
I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps - I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturing my peeps not eating can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbing bitches like the Phantom
The crew is lampin', Ill Will style
Check the gold-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burning dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames
Plus the games people play
I check the dames plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
[Outro:]
(Whose world is this?)
Yea, Wizard, keep that lye in the air, yo
I wanna give a shoutout to the whole fucking Queens
My man Tipster on the boards, keeping it real lord
The Queensbridge nation, get it on
Faking no fucking jacks
Fuck around get your wig pushed back
Big shoutout to my man killa, Ron do is on you
L-A-S is on another murder quest
'94, we out
Keep the lye in the air, Hennessy everywhere
(La-la-la-la-la-la)
Keep the la-la going
(La-la-la-la-la-la)

The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe

Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets

There's no days for broke days selling smoke pays

And yo, the trife life is the most influential

You're wasting time extorting papers from smokers
Catching court papers getting broker

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin bitches like the Phantom
The crew is lampin Ill Will style
Check the gold toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin dames

People play, I check the games plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today
